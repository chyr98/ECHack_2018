"Throughout his 50 years as publisher of the Toronto Star from 1899 to 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson developed strong views on both the role of a large city newspaper and the editorial principles it should espouse. These values and beliefs now form what are called the Atkinson Principles. For more than a century, they have provided the intellectual foundation on which the Star has operated and have given the paper its distinctive voice. The editorial principles Atkinson espoused were founded on his belief that a progressive newspaper should contribute to the advancement of society through pursuit of social, economic and political reforms. He was particularly concerned about injustice, be it social, economic, political, legal or racial. Fundamental to his philosophy was the belief that the state has the right, and duty, to act when private initiative fails. While Atkinson's beliefs were never codified in any set form, the central Principles can be summarized as follows: ",0,Atkinson Principles
"Founded in 1892, the Toronto Star has long been Canada’s largest daily newspaper. Now a multi-platform news organization, the Star publishes a newspaper seven days a week in the Greater Toronto Area and publishes ongoing news and information to a global audience on thestar.com on web and mobile applications. The Star is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of  . Torstar Corporation is a broadly based, progressive media company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TS.B), with a long history in daily and community newspapers, book publishing and digital businesses. Built on the foundation of the Toronto Star, Torstar has grown into a diversified media company with a growing portfolio of businesses and investments that reach consumers in Canada, the United States and around the world. The company  publishes more than 80 newspapers and operates dozens of digital businesses in Canada through its main operating segments, Daily News Brands, Community Brands and Digital Ventures. Daily News Brands, led by its flagship brand, the Toronto Star, also includes thestar.com, one of the most-visited newspaper websites in Canada, as well as The Hamilton Spectator, Waterloo Region Record, St. Catharines Standard, Niagara Falls Review, Welland Tribune, Peterborough Examiner and and the Chinese-language newspaper Sing Tao Daily. The Community Brands segment publishes more than 80 community newspapers in print and online and has numerous properties, distribution services, directories, specialty publications and operates a variety of consumer shows. In April 2018, Torstar aligned its urban commuter newspapers with thestar.com. The StarMetro newspapers are published Monday through Friday, with local editions in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto and Halifax The Toronto Star is a multi-platform news organization that makes things happen. We inform, connect, investigate, report and effect change. The purpose of the Toronto Star is to keep our customers informed about what matters most to them, to help make their life, community, country and world better. Our mission is to deliver trusted news, information and content on all platforms. We focus public attention on injustices of all kinds and on reforms designed to correct them. We are the news organization people turn to when they need help; when they want to see the scales balanced, wrongs righted; when they want powerful people held to account.  The Star has long been guided by the values of Joseph E. Atkinson, publisher from 1899 to 1948. Throughout his leadership Atkinson developed strong views on both the role of a large city newspaper and the editorial principles it should espouse. These values and beliefs now form what are called the Atkinson Principles, the foundation of the Star’s ongoing commitment to investigating and advocating for social and economic justice. The principles Atkinson espoused were founded on his belief that a progressive news organization should contribute to the advancement of society through pursuit of social, economic and political reforms. He was particularly concerned about injustice, be it social, economic, political, legal or racial. Fundamental to Atkinson’s philosophy was the belief that the state has the right, and duty, to act when private initiative fails. The central Principles can be summarized as follows:  about the   and Joseph E. Atkinson, Publisher, 1899-1948. Trust is the core of the relationship between a news organization and its audiences. As  the Star’s longtime publisher Beland Honderich said in November 1972, on the occasion of the opening of the Star’s new offices at One Yonge St.: “The most valuable asset a newspaper can have is its reputation for telling the truth.”     Much has changed since then, with the Star now publishing on multiple digital platforms to a global audience. But, what cannot be altered is the Star’s strong commitment to building and maintaining its credibility with its customers by providing trustworthy news and information — news and information that is accurate, accountable and ethically produced.     To that end, the Star has taken several steps to enhance reader trust: We are a member of the  , a global consortium of news companies that have committed to transparency standards that help audiences  easily assess the quality and credibility of digital journalism. This project, whose goal is to fight misinformation and elevate trustworthy, ethically produced news so both the public and news distribution platforms can find it easily, is led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman, of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California. The Trust Project’s initial funder was Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist,  as part of the Trustworthy Journalism Initiative of Craig Newmark Philanthropies. Google was an early financial supporter as well. The project is also supported  by the Democracy Fund, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation  and the Markkula Foundation. In  2017, the Star also launched its own  , which aims to foster greater trust by providing a window into the journalism we produce. Staff from across Torstar Corp. meet regularly to develop ways to improve transparency, while trust feature articles offer readers a window into the reporting and decision-making behind our news and feature stories. The Star holds itself accountable for its journalistic standards. Readers who have concerns about the accuracy or integrity of the Star’s  journalism have access to our , which handles queries about accuracy and the Star’s journalistic standards, in line with our commitment to accountability and transparency.  provides a comprehensive code of journalistic principles and conduct to guide Toronto Star journalists in their mission to responsibly engage and connect our readers on all platforms with trusted news, information and content. Here are the general editorial principles that provide the foundation for this guide: The Star has responsibilities to its customers, its clients, its  shareholders and its employees. But the operation of a news organization is, above all, a public trust, no less binding because it is not formally conferred. Our overriding responsibility is to the democratic society. Freedom of expression and of the press must be defended against encroachment from any quarter, public or private. Journalists must ensure that the public’s business is conducted in public. They must be vigilant against all who would exploit the press for selfish purposes. Journalists who abuse the power of their professional roles for selfish motives or unworthy purposes are faithless to that public trust. The Star is a forum for the interchange of information and opinion. It should provide for the expression of disparate and conflicting views. It should give expression to the interests of minorities as well as majorities, of the powerless as well as the powerful.  Good faith with the reader is the foundation of ethical and excellent journalism. That good faith rests primarily on the reader’s confidence that what we print is correct. Every effort must be made to ensure that everything published in the Star is accurate, is presented in context, and that all significant sides are presented fairly. Journalistic integrity demands that significant errors of fact, as well as errors of omission, should be corrected promptly and as prominently and transparently as warranted.  .   The Star should respect the rights of people involved in the news, be transparent and stand accountable to the public for the fairness and reliability of everything it publishes. Fair news reports provide relevant context, do not omit relevant facts and aim to be honest with readers about what we know and what we do not know. Our core fariness standard demands that any subject of potentially harmful allegations must be given opportunity to respond. Independence from those we cover is a key principle of journalistic integrity. We avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. The Star believes in paying the costs incurred in gathering and publishing news. In circumstances where that may not be possible, we disclose information that could create the perception of a conflict of interest. Transparency with our readers and  openness about  the potential for conflicts should guide our considerations about real or perceived conflicts. To be impartial does not require a news organization to be unquestioning or to refrain from editorial expression. Sound practice, however, demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion. All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate. Every person has a right to privacy. There are inevitable conflicts between the right to privacy, the public good and the public's right to be informed about the conduct of public affairs. Each case should be judged in the light of common sense and humanity. There can be no compromise with accuracy. Accuracy is our most basic contract with readers and is the responsibility of everyone in our newsrooms. Accuracy is grounded in verification, the essence of journalism. We must check and double-check all the information we publish, including information from all other publications. Mistakes will happen. When they do, we correct our errors. Corrections serve the reader and they serve the public record. They are essential to building and maintaining trust with our readers. Anyone who becomes aware of a possible error has responsibility for alerting those responsible for corrections in their newsrooms. Our corrections are guided by the core principles of accountability and transparency. We are accountable to our readers for the accuracy of the information we publish in stories, headlines, photos, cutlines, social media, graphics, data, videos and any other content on all of our platforms. We correct errors of fact in a clear, transparent manner on the platform(s) in which the error was published, as promptly as possible. We make clear to readers the correct information and the context and magnitude of the mistake. On all of our platforms, it should be clear to readers how to report a possible error. You can find our corrections  . You can learn how to report an error  . Inclusiveness is at the heart of thinking and acting as journalists. Torstar newsrooms aim to reflect the diversity of our communities and respect the human rights and equal dignity of all. We aim for a variety of voices as sources and contributors in our news and opinion. We seek to foster greater community understanding about ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, socio-economic status and physical/mental ability and do not perpetuate hurtful stereotypes. Generally no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story. In the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large, there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose. At times, a group may make race a public issue. In such cases, the person’s race becomes relevant to the news. Religion is important to the lives of many of our readers. We should not hold up one religion or set of beliefs as superior to another. Do not single out a religion or religious practice for ridicule or stereotyping or use profanities considered offensive to any religions. We treat men and women equally and respect diverse gender identities, including people who identify as neither male nor female. Torstar is committed to this same inclusivness and diversity reflective of our communities in its hiring, promotion, development and retention of its staff. The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names. Torstar journalists are aggressive in pressing sources to put information on the record and seek independently to corroborate off-the-record information. We do not provide anonymity to those who attack individuals or organizations or engage in speculation — the unattributed cheap shot. People under attack in our publications have the right to know their accusers. There are times when reporters need confidential sources to serve readers and democracy. Responsible journalism in the public interest often depends on these confidential sources who give journalists information that powerful people seek to keep secret. There are times also when some sources, such as underage or other vulnerable people, may require anonymity in telling their stories. Torstar journalists must discuss using any confidential sources with their department head, and in some cases the newsroom’s most senior editor. Torstar journalists must discuss using confidential sources with their department head, and in some cases the newsroom’s most senior editor. They must always reveal the source’s identity to editors, and provide a compelling argument for why the source will not be named in news reports. Senior editors have responsibility to work with reporters to assess the credibility of all sources including confidential sources. Once any promise is made to grant anonymity, we protect our source, only revealing their identity with that person’s permission. Published articles must explain why sources have been granted anonymity and why we consider them authoritative and credible. Confidential sources should have first-hand knowledge of the information and this must be conveyed to the reader. We should publish as much information as possible about the source — including why they sought confidentiality — without revealing identity. The definitions and ground rules for not naming a source must be discussed with sources. Any further promises made or deals brokered with any source must be discussed in advance with senior editors and are subject to the following: • Composites, where several sources are compiled into one person, are not used. Pseudonyms are used only rarely, with a senior editor’s permission, and must be declared as such in stories. • The source and the journalist must be clear on what has been agreed to and that agreement must be shared with the department manager. Torstar journalists keep their promises. Independence from those we cover is a key principle of journalistic integrity. We avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. In circumstances where that may not be possible, we disclose information that could create the perception of a conflict of interest. Transparency with our readers and openness about the potential for conflicts should guide our considerations about real or perceived conflicts. These policies apply to all outside interests that could cause our audiences to question the fairness and independence of our journalism. We seek primarily to ensure that our reporters’ reputations as fair-minded fact-finders are not compromised by public displays of political or partisan views on public issues, nor influenced by personal involvement or personal axe-grinding on issues we cover. Opinion journalists have greater leeway on these matters, in line with the latitude to express their own views in their work. All Torstar editorial staff should inform their immediate supervisors of any outside activity that could result in a conflict of interest, or reasonably perceived conflict of interest, that could cause our audiences to question the integrity of our work. These policies are not intended to restrict the personal lives, interests or expressions of beliefs of Torstar journalists outside their work lives.  Rather, as has been established through various arbitration processes across the company, they seek to ensure that any such personal activities and interests do not come into conflict with the public role of our news organizations in any way that could be seen to compromise our editorial independence and integrity. The Star clearly labels content on all platforms to draw a clear line between news and opinion. This glossary provides definitions for various types of news and opinion we publish. News content is verified information based on the impartial reporting of facts, either observed by the reporter or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. News  reports do not include the opinion of the author.  A critical or contextual examination of an important and topical issue based on factual reporting. It provides an explanation of the impact or meaning of news events and draws on the authority and expertise of the writer. Analysis articles do not contain the author’s opinions.      In-depth reporting in the public interest that reveals wrongdoing and/or systemic problems, holds those in power accountable and promotes positive change. Opinion articles based are based on personal interpretation and judgment of facts. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views, subject to standards of taste and laws of libel including views directly contrary to the editorial views of the Star.  An article that presents a point of view reflecting the news organization's position on an issue of public interest. Editorials are not meant to be a neutral presentation of the facts. They are written by journalists who are expressing the view of the news organization.

An advice article reflects the opinion of the author, who provides guidance or direction on a topic based on their expertise as well as their personal interpretations and judgments of facts.      An online journal updated regularly by a journalist or editorial department that supplements news coverage. Blogs are usually informal or conversational in style and may reflect a writer’s opinions, subject to the rights and responsibilities of fair comment.

" Ethical journalism is the foundation of Torstar news organizations’ integrity and is essential to our credibility with our audiences. Accuracy, fairness and quality journalism have long been critical to our newsrooms, and are especially so in this digital media ecosystem where trust and transparency matter more than ever. This 2018 version of the Torstar Journalistic Standards Guide provides a comprehensive code of journalistic principles and conduct to guide us in our mission: to responsibly engage and connect with our readers on all platforms with trusted news, information and content to help make their lives, their communities, our country and our world better. No code of conduct can cover every eventuality in the 24-7 production of news and information on multiple platforms. Common sense, good judgment and the journalist’s own moral compass must be brought to bear on any set of guidelines. We should be prepared to explain publicly what we do in gathering and presenting news and information and the journalistic judgments involved in all we publish. All Torstar newsrooms are members of the National NewsMedia Council. The NNC considers complaints from members of the public who are not satisfied with the news organization’s response about its judgments. In adjudicating any complaint, the NNC considers a set of criteria that includes the news organization’s own code of conduct, generally accepted national and regional journalistic standards, and any other considerations deemed valid by the NNC board. These policies apply to all Torstar editorial staff in the creation and publication of all editorial content on any platform. Any breach of policy can lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. These policies also apply to all freelancers when creating content for Torstar newsrooms. Some of these policies may also apply to persons on leave. Staff should check with their department heads if they are uncertain.

Transparency with our readers about the potential for conflicts should guide our considerations about real or perceived conflicts. To be impartial does not require a news organization to be unquestioning or to refrain from editorial expression. Sound practice, however, demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion. All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate. Every person has a right to privacy. There are inevitable conflicts between the right to privacy, the public good and the right of the public to be informed about the conduct of public affairs. Each case should be judged in the light of common sense and humanity. Here are the policies that guide our work: There can be no compromise with accuracy. Accuracy is our most basic contract with readers and is the responsibility of everyone in our newsrooms. Accuracy is grounded in verification, the essence of journalism. We must check and double-check all the information we publish, including information from all other publications. Mistakes will happen. When they do, we correct our errors. Corrections serve the reader and they serve the public record. They are essential to building and maintaining trust with our readers. Anyone who becomes aware of a possible error has responsibility for alerting those responsible for corrections in their newsrooms. Our corrections are guided by the core principles of accountability and transparency. We are accountable to our readers for the accuracy of the information we publish in stories, headlines, photos, cutlines, social media, graphics, data, videos and any other content on all of our platforms. We correct errors of fact in a clear, transparent manner on the platform(s) in which the error was published, as promptly as possible. We make clear to readers the correct information and the context and magnitude of the mistake. Published corrections do not ascribe blame within our news organizations.   On all of our platforms, it should be clear to readers how to report a possible error. You can find our corrections  . The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names. We should be aggressive in pressing sources to put information on the record and should seek independently to corroborate off-the-record information. We do not provide anonymity to those who attack individuals or organizations or engage in speculation — the unattributed cheap shot. People under attack in our publications have the right to know their accusers. There are times when reporters need confidential sources to serve readers and democracy. Responsible journalism in the public interest often depends on these confidential sources who give journalists information that powerful people seek to keep secret. There are times also when some sources, such as underage or other vulnerable people, may require anonymity in telling their stories. Torstar journalists must discuss using confidential sources with their department head, and in some cases the newsroom’s most senior editor. They must always reveal the source’s identity to editors, and provide a compelling argument for why the source will not be named in news reports. Senior editors have responsibility to work with reporters to assess the credibility of all sources including confidential sources. Once any promise is made to grant anonymity, we protect our source, only revealing their identity with that person’s permission. Published articles must explain why sources have been granted anonymity and why we consider them authoritative and credible. Confidential sources should have first-hand knowledge of the information and this must be conveyed to the reader. We should publish as much information as possible about the source — including why they sought confidentiality — without revealing identity. The definitions and ground rules for not naming a source must be discussed with sources. Any further promises made or deals brokered with any source must be discussed in advance with senior editors and are subject to the following: • Composites, where several sources are compiled into one person, are not used. Pseudonyms are used only rarely, with a senior editor’s permission, and must be declared as such in stories. • The source and the journalist must be clear on what has been agreed to and that agreement must be shared with the department manager. Torstar journalists keep their promises.   We do not present other media’s reporting as our own or publish unattributed material from other sources. Plagiarism — the unattributed use of words or ideas from another published source — is grounds for discipline or dismissal. Background information from previously published Torstar stories may be reused without credit. We attribute and credit material to its source, including reporting obtained exclusively by other media organizations on any platform. If an article contains a significant amount of wire copy, then the agency and/or author should be credited. Any information from social media and other digital sources such as Facebook, Twitter and personal or corporate websites must be verified to establish the bona fides of the sources, who should be properly credited for the information. Inclusiveness is at the heart of thinking and acting as journalists. Torstar newsrooms aim to reflect the diversity of our communities and respect the human rights and equal dignity of all. We aim for a variety of voices as sources and contributors in our news and opinion. We seek to foster greater community understanding about ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, socio-economic status and physical/mental ability and do not perpetuate hurtful stereotypes. Generally no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story. In the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large, there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose. At times, a group may make race a public issue. In such cases, the person’s race becomes relevant to the news. Religion is important to the lives of many of our readers. Do not hold up one religion or set of beliefs as superior to another. Do not single out a religion or religious practice for ridicule or stereotyping or use profanities considered offensive to any religions. We treat men and women equally and respect diverse gender identities, including people who identify as neither male nor female. If a report is obtained from a credible source on the understanding that it not be published until a certain date and time, we agree to the embargo unless it is broken by other media. Generally, this does not apply to widely distributed email press releases that include an embargo date. We respect the rights of people involved in the news, act with decency in our conduct with readers and those we report on, and stand accountable for the fairness and reliability of our journalism. Fair news reports provide relevant context, do not omit relevant facts, and aim to be honest with readers about what we know and what we don’t know. We are obligated to investigate and publish all sides of the news we report. The essence of fairness demands that before publication every effort must be made to present subjects with all allegations — the sooner the better, and the more detailed the better.  If an individual cannot be reached or refuses to comment, the article must state this and, if applicable, report any reasons why the opportunity to comment was refused. Rebuttals and unsuccessful attempts to reach subjects should be prominent, not buried. News reports should be straightforward and not indulge in inferences or use words such as “claimed” in a pejorative manner. Torstar newsrooms generally do not publish articles about bomb scares and related hoaxes. Exceptions may be made if the scare becomes a significant public event. Torstar journalists must clearly identify themselves as journalists gathering information for possible publication, be it in person, on the telephone, by email or through social media platforms. This is the most basic contract between a journalist and a source - the foundation of informed consent in journalism. Undercover reporting, photography and surveillance video should be used rarely, and a case must be made that the story to be uncovered is of significant public interest and the event to be investigated is a sustained, consistent practice, not a “gotcha.” Advance approval by senior editors of any undercover work is required. In such cases, the extent of and reason for the deception should be clearly communicated in the resulting published reports. Cameras and audio recorders should not be concealed except in unusual circumstances and only with the approval of senior editors. It is permissible to record telephone interviews without a source’s knowledge to provide an accurate record of a conversation but these recordings should not be used for other purposes, such as being replayed on radio or on our websites. In certain cases involving kidnapping, hostage taking and/or terrorism, when publication could endanger someone’s life, we should put the victim’s safety first. Decisions to withhold news in such cases must be approved by senior editors. In line with our commitment to engage and connect our communities and reflect a diversity of views, Torstar news organizations aim to publish a representative sample of the letters to the editor they receive, striving to reflect the many sides of any issue. Preference is given to ordinary readers over professional letter writers, special interest groups and public figures. We reserve the right to edit letters for length, style and clarity. Letter writers have the last word; that means columnists must not attack or rebut letter writers in subsequent published articles. Exceptions may be made if the letter writers are public figures. Except when necessary for legal reasons, letters criticizing a Torstar employee’s work should not be published without such criticism being reviewed with the employee before publication, if it is practical to do so. Multimedia work documents reality and generally should not depict contrived situations. Any photo illustrations or staged situations should be clearly labelled for readers. Torstar photojournalists and videographers must respect the moment in aiming to capture reality. If the moment passes without being recorded, it should not be restaged in order to make an image. All ambient sound during the shooting of news, features or documentaries should be collected on site. Canned sound effects must not be used and presented as reality. Editors must select and crop photos and consult with photographers to bring out the most accurate, truthful account of each situation. While digital manipulation is permissible to improve technical quality, any alteration or enhancement that renders a photograph inaccurate or misleading is forbidden. When editing any multimedia content, care must be taken not to manipulate the story, distort reality or mislead. In editing audio files, words may not be inserted or rearranged to mislead or change the intent and context of the interview and/or action. Ambient sound collected in one location must not be used with footage gathered elsewhere. Editors must verify the authenticity of handout photos and images sourced from social media. Except in rare instances, cutlines or credit lines must identify the source of such photographs. Torstar newsrooms clearly label content on all platforms to draw a clear line between news and opinion. News content is verified information based on the impartial reporting of facts, either observed by reporters or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. News reports do not include the opinion of the author. Opinion articles are based on personal interpretation and judgment of facts. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views, subject to standards of taste and laws of libel, including views directly contrary to the editorial views of Torstar news organizations.   This glossary provides definitions for the various types of news and opinion content we publish.     A critical or contextual examination of an important and topical issue based on factual reporting. It provides an explanation of the impact or meaning of news events and draws on the authority and expertise of the writer. Analysis articles do not contain the author’s opinions.  In-depth reporting in the public interest that reveals wrongdoing and/or systemic problems, holds those in power accountable and promotes positive change.  An article that presents a point of view reflecting the news organization's position on an issue of public interest. Editorials are not meant to be a neutral presentation of the facts. They are written by journalists who are expressing the view of the news organization. As an editorial serves to present the company’s voice, there is no individual byline.  Articles based on the author’s interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events. Opinion articles include columns written by staff and commentary from non-staff contributors. Opinion journalists have wide latitude to express their own views including views directly contrary to the news organization's editorial views, as long as they fall within the boundaries of taste and laws of libel. Columnists should not engage in personal axe-grinding or internecine debates with other columnists who write for their own or other publications. An advice article reflects the opinion of the author, who provides guidance or direction on a topic based on their expertise as well as their personal interpretations and judgments of facts. An online journal updated regularly by a journalist or editorial department that supplements news coverage. Blogs are usually informal or conversational in style and may reflect a writer’s opinions, subject to the rights and responsibilities of fair comment.  Narratives exploring an author’s insights, observations or thoughts based on that individual’s personal experience and opinions. A selection of letters by readers expressing a point of view, usually concerning a recently published article or current event. A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food or literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion. Torstar newsrooms do not pay for information other than standard fees for syndicated trusted news services, photographs, videos, book excerpts and freelance stories. Torstar newsrooms do not mislead readers by suggesting our journalists or freelancers were someplace they were not. In reporting polls, we must give readers full context: names of the sponsor and the polling agency, population from which the sample was drawn, sample size, margin of error, type of interview (telephone, mail, online, in-home), dates when the poll was conducted, and wording of the questions on which the story focuses. Some polls are misleading. We should be particularly skeptical of polls sponsored by special interest groups, which may be slanted to produce an answer favourable to the interest group. Articles on reports and studies should include information on who funded them. As much information as possible should be published about the methodology so readers can judge the credibility of the study, especially the sample size, the geographic area and time period, the group surveyed or studied, and how the data was selected. Reports of studies should generally be based on peer-reviewed, reputable journals and should include independent comment. Conflicts between the public’s right to know and individuals’ reasonable expectation of privacy are inevitable in the gathering and publishing of news, but common sense, our duty to report in the public interest and some measure of compassion should govern our judgment. Children and teenagers — particularly those under the age of 16 who may not fully understand the implications of speaking to the media — command a special sensitivity. So, too, do those experiencing tragedy or grief. People should be treated with sensitivity during times of grief or trauma. Visual journalists should be sensitive when photographing children under 16 without permission of a parent or guardian. A decision on publishing or posting any such images will be made by a senior editor who will consider all circumstances, including the public interest. We keep our promises. Torstar journalists must receive full approval of senior editors before any promises can be made to a source or subject. We do not make promises to sources or subjects about whether or when a story will be published; how a story, photograph or video will be displayed; the prominence it will be given; or what any aspect of the report will say. Journalists should not promise to read back an article to sources, unless this has been approved by senior editors. What appears inside quotation marks in published articles must be an accurate representation of what was written or said. Grammatical errors can be corrected and some idiosyncratic expressions of speech can be omitted. Paraphrasing is acceptable and even preferable if the accuracy of a direct quote cannot be verified, but any paraphrasing must fairly reflect the source’s words. Circumstances and context for quotes, including whether the comment was in response to a question and whether it came from email or social media, should be provided when relevant. If quotes appear out of sequence, changes in circumstance and context should be reported. Circumstance and context include body language, facial expressions, audience and inflection. Quotes cited from interviews conducted through a translator must be identified as such. Reconstructed dialogue must be cleared by a senior editor and should be published only with the acknowledgment that it is reconstructed from a source’s memory. The source should be named. Except in rare, often legal, circumstances — which must be agreed upon by senior editors — we do not remove content from our websites or archives. Fairness to those named in the news means there may be rare cases in which senior editors agree to remove content because it is judged to be the humane thing to do in the circumstances. Any decision to remove published content should be weighed against the public’s right to know and the historical record. Torstar journalists are always Torstar journalists. Journalists are encouraged to be themselves and find their own voices on social media, but it’s important to remember that the content they post and the way they conduct themselves can have an impact on reader trust, the journalistic reputation of our newsrooms, our brands and the company’s public standing. This is true regardless of the privacy settings on a journalist’s account, their profile description or whether they consider an account personal. This policy applies to all editorial staff across all Torstar newsrooms. Other newsroom and corporate policies, such as those governing corrections, ethics and the business code of conduct, also apply to social media use. Here are the key points: • Staff must not do anything on social media that damages the company’s reputation for fair journalism. That includes making partisan or offensive comments, endorsing candidates or — with the exception of opinion columnists — taking sides on issues our newsrooms are covering. • Torstar journalists must not use social media to criticize or undermine the company, their colleagues or the work of their colleagues. • Fact-based analysis by reporters is not opinion. In areas of reporting expertise, social media can be an effective platform for using facts to authoritatively point out lies, questionable behaviour, baseless claims and policies unsupported by evidence, even if doing so leads to a perception of being negative to one side of a public debate. • Torstar opinion journalists have the same wide latitude to express opinions on social media as they are given on our other platforms. • Torstar journalists must not purchase followers or pay for any service to artificially inflate their social media following. • Except for reporting purposes, Torstar journalists must not join partisan groups on Facebook or elsewhere — even if those groups are marked “secret.” Journalists should not use social media accounts to register for partisan events. If they wish to join a group for reporting purposes, they should identify themselves and consider how their posts would be interpreted if made public. When in doubt, journalists should talk to a supervisor, especially if they feel the need to join a group anonymously.    • Staff should not use social media to make customer service complaints or lobby politicians. Their grievances may be frustrating, but they are likely to be treated differently because of their position. • Torstar encourages journalists to listen and interact respectfully with readers who engage them in productive ways. • If a reader’s comments are inconsiderate or could be considered trolling, it’s best not to respond. Journalists are encouraged to block or mute someone who is making threatening, abusive or harassing comments. It is never appropriate to threaten someone or direct profanity at them. • A staff member who feels threatened by someone on social media should inform their supervisor immediately. Torstar has policies in place to protect its journalists. We should not shy away from writing about suicide when the story is newsworthy and considered to be in the public interest. Such reports should respect the grief of survivors and strive to provide information for others about how to get help. Generally, we should not provide explicit details about methods used or reach simplistic conclusions about why a person took their own life. Suicide stories must be discussed with senior editors before publication. Our newsrooms respect taste and decency, understanding that our communities’ concepts of taste and decency are constantly changing and may vary across the platforms on which we communicate. The following should be handled with care in consultation with senior editors: •   Unless they are in direct quotations, they should rarely be used. In publishing obscenities, we use short dashes following the first letter, except in rare cases, determined by senior editors, where spelling out the word in full is considered central to understanding the context of the news. •   Again, these should be used sparingly and only in direct quotations, when essential to the meaning of the story. •  Publishing graphic images of dead bodies, bloodied victims and traumatized survivors of bombings, massacres, torture and other tragedies can be justified when the image is considered to be historically relevant and/or advances the story in a serious and considered manner; when it conveys information relevant to the story; and when it is not intended to shock our audiences gratuitously. Independence from those we cover is a key principle of journalistic integrity. We avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. In circumstances where that may not be possible, we disclose information that could create the perception of a conflict of interest. Transparency with our readers and openness about the potential for conflicts should guide our considerations about real or perceived conflicts. These policies apply to all outside interests that could cause our audiences to question the fairness and independence of our journalism. We seek primarily to ensure that our reporters’ reputations as fair-minded fact-finders are not compromised by public displays of political or partisan views on public issues, nor influenced by personal involvement or personal axe-grinding on issues we cover.   Opinion journalists have greater leeway on these matters, in line with the latitude to express their own views in their work. All Torstar editorial staff should inform their immediate supervisors of any outside activity that could result in a conflict of interest, or reasonably perceived conflict of interest, that could cause our audiences to question the integrity of our work. These policies are not intended to restrict the personal lives, interests or expressions of beliefs of Torstar journalists outside their work lives.  Rather, as has been established through various arbitration processes across the company, they seek to ensure that any such personal activities and interests do not come into conflict with the public role of our news organizations in any way that could be seen to compromise our editorial independence and integrity. Editorial staff should not hold elected political office, work on political campaigns, or write speeches for political parties or officials. Care should be exercised by all editorial staff, but particularly those reporting the news, to avoid open endorsement of any political candidate or political cause, including personal comments on social media platforms. Editorial staff should not make financial contributions to a political campaign if they may be called upon to cover the campaign. Bear in mind that such contributions are often subject to public disclosure. Editorial staff should not hold office in community organizations involved in activities about which they may write or make editorial judgments. This includes fundraising or public relations work, and active participation in community organizations and pressure groups that take positions on public issues. Editorial staff should avoid participation in judicial and other official investigations into wrongdoing. Such inquiries are often prompted by our reporting. Our participation should end there. Senior editors should be informed if any employee is summoned to appear. News reporters should avoid participation in demonstrations or the signing of petitions, including online petitions and social media campaigns, on political or partisan issues that they may be called upon to cover. Opinion journalists should discuss such participation with their editors. Torstar editorial employees may not use their positions to obtain any benefit or advantage in commercial transactions not available to the general public. Torstar encourages its editorial staff members to seek recognition for their work, but they should avoid contests that may create the appearance of a conflict. No Torstar journalist shall enter any awards program sponsored or administered by the profession, industry or community the journalist covers. Any entries submitted for consideration for awards or contests must receive prior approval of senior editors. Editorial employees must not use their close relatives or close friends to circumvent Torstar conflict guidelines. It should be recognized that the involvement of a close family member in politics or some other high-profile position may result in a change of assignment. Editorial staff should not write about, photograph or make news judgments about close relatives or friends unless this conflict is made clear to readers. We aim to pay our own way in covering the news. Editorial staff and freelancers should not accept or solicit gifts, passes or favours. Other than in the following circumstances, disregarding this policy is a serious offence and could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal for staff members and cancellation of regular work for freelancers.  It is not our intention to ban the trinkets that sometimes accompany news releases, but rather merchandise that is of real value. Any unsolicited gift of more than nominal retail value — more than $25, as a general principle — should be returned promptly with a polite explanation. If in doubt, editorial employees should consult their department heads. If it is impractical to return the gift, it should be turned over to the department head, who shall donate it to an appropriate charity or institution, or the gift should be sold and the money donated to charity. Occasionally, an editorial staff member will be invited to a gala opening as a representative of the news organization. It is generally not appropriate to attend unless the staff person has the approval of their department head. There are several obvious exceptions. We accept reviewers’ tickets for film previews and theatrical performances. Passes for working media are accepted for some sporting events, but only for those journalists and photographers covering the event. Tickets occasionally provided by our newsrooms to various events are also exempt. We pay for travel expenses. This includes sports journalists covering road games, travel writers touring foreign locations and entertainment journalists attending out-of-town interviews arranged by studios and promoters — three circumstances in which “junkets” are available and are increasingly accepted by other media organizations. It is clear there are some stories, particularly in special sections such as travel and automotive, that are difficult or even impossible to cover without accepting a media rate or relying on a freelancer who has done so. Key principles should apply in such circumstances: transparency and news judgment. Stories in which an editorial employee or freelancer has accepted free or discounted travel or accommodations must carry an endnote explaining to readers the particular circumstances of gaining access to the story. As examples: or Media rates for editorial staffers and freelancers should be accepted only with the prior approval of the section editor. All trips by editorial employees who plan to freelance for the travel department must be assigned or the trip approved in advance by the travel editor. Staff members outside the travel department are forbidden from using their position as Torstar employees to gain access to travel discounts or media rates. Editorial staff members occasionally will be invited to sit on a panel or deliver a paper at an academic conference or policy seminar. It is permissible for the host to pay the staff member’s travel and hotel expenses, but any such payments must be disclosed in any reporting on that event. Before accepting such an invitation, staff members should check with senior editors. Editorial employees should avoid writing about any subject in which they have a financial interest. Any employee asked to do such a story should declare the interest to their supervisor and another employee should be assigned. Staff in our business departments have a particular obligation in this regard. They should not own stocks or other securities in sectors they regularly cover or could reasonably be expected to cover. Furthermore, they should disclose to their department head all holdings of individual securities (i.e., stocks, corporate bonds and mutual funds) in all accounts in which the employee has part or whole decision-making authority. For freelance columnists whose work is based on their expertise as investors, there is an exception to this general policy. This dual role must be clearly acknowledged in a note at the end of their columns. Within narrow limits, editorial staff may use a product for a short time to test or evaluate it, but any extended use of these products is not allowed. Exceptions include books, recordings, foodstuffs and other products that are sent unsolicited for reviewing. All material not reviewed should either be returned, be donated to a library or charity, or be sold and the money donated to charity. Editorial staff members are generally free to appear on radio and television, provided this is done on the employee’s own time. Such work is subject to the following conditions: • The department head must be notified in advance and the company reserves the right to veto such appearances. • When appearing in other media, a journalist or commentator should be identified as a journalist of the specific newsroom for which they work. • In no circumstances will editorial employees release or discuss in any other media, including social media, any exclusive item before it has been published by Torstar, unless explicitly authorized by senior editors. • No staff should enter into a regular commitment (i.e., weekly or more frequently) with other media without the approval of senior editors. Before addressing an outside group, whether through an event organized by the company’s Speakers Bureau or independently, editorial staff must consider whether an actual or apparent conflict of interest or threat to the perceived fairness of our journalism exists. Any invitations to make paid speeches must be discussed with senior editors to consider the potential for conflict or perceived conflict of interest. Generally, we should not accept payment from those we cover, particularly political or advocacy groups or commercial interests. Employees should not accept invitations from outside companies or organizations to speak where the function is to attract customers to an event primarily intended as profit-making for that company or organization. Torstar newsrooms seek not to publish anything that would jeopardize the right to a fair trial of a person accused of a crime. We also believe in freedom of expression and the public’s right to know what is happening in the courts.   Just before or during a trial, these principles sometimes collide. But at the time of arrest, we believe it is in the public interest to publish as much relevant and fair information about the accused as possible, and that reporting such information does not jeopardize the right to a fair trial. In general, the police theory of crime and motive as well as the criminal record of the accused are relevant information to publish at the time of arrest. We sometimes live-stream police press conferences about arrests and believe the public interest of doing so outweighs the potential for a highly prejudicial statement about the accused, such as a statement that the accused is guilty. However, we guard against repeating such statements in further reporting on the news conference. We also believe that publication of new information about a case up to six months before a trial does not jeopardize the rights of the accused. The nearer to a trial date new information emerges, the more carefully its public interest must be weighed against the rights of the accused. We should not publish stories that state an accused person is guilty. At the time of arrest, the accused is often unable to respond to incriminating information or evidence of bad character. Fairness therefore requires that editors carefully consider the quality and accuracy of information reported about the accused. Prejudicial or negative statements about the accused should be published only when an editor deems they are well founded and there is a compelling public interest in doing so. Media have less leeway to publish information just before or during a trial. We must not publish statements by police that tend to incriminate the accused or evidence of the bad character of the accused just before or during a trial until such information is presented as evidence in court. Doing so could cause a mistrial and result in our being cited for contempt of court. We do not report that an accused person has confessed until the confession has been ruled admissible and entered into evidence in court. The names of people charged with criminal offences are reported in our news stories unless there is a legal or ethical reason not to do so. Wherever possible, we try to distinguish the accused from others who share the same name by specifying their age, occupation and general place of residence. We believe it is in the public interest to publish the names of all adult parties to a trial in the absence of a publication ban, including names of witnesses and victims, except for victims of sexual assault.  In the absence of a publication ban, Torstar newsrooms do not agree to requests to withhold names of those involved in a trial except in exceptional circumstances, and with the permission of senior editors. Stories about court proceedings must be fair and accurate. When one side makes an important point, journalists should make every effort to report cross-examination on that point or contradictory evidence presented by the other side. Journalists should never speak with jurors about a case before the trial is over. Journalists can talk to jurors after a trial, but it is illegal for jurors to discuss the deliberations or how the jury arrived at its decision. When we become aware that charges have been dropped against people who were named in news stories at the time of their arrest, or that the accused has been acquitted, we report the information promptly. News reports of criminal charges published on digital platforms will be updated with a prominent note at the top of the article stating the outcome of any charges. Publication bans are routinely and automatically granted by courts in bail hearings, preliminary hearings and certain pre-trial motions dealing with the admissibility of evidence. While Torstar news organizations strongly believe that open courts, openly reported on, provide confidence to the public that justice is being done, we honour such court-imposed bans. On occasion, a court will impose an extraordinary ban that goes well beyond the routine, such as a ban on publishing the name of someone accused of a serious crime or a witness in a case. On the instructions of the editor-in-chief, we may oppose such extraordinary bans in court when we believe it is in the public interest for the information to be reported. Editorial staff should show sensitivity when dealing with victims of crime and their families. Crime victims and their relatives should never be harassed to obtain their stories, identities or photographs. Journalists must clearly identify themselves and never use deception. Torstar news organizations do not publish the names of victims of alleged sexual assaults, or anything that would identify them, unless such victims agree to be identified and senior editors consider it in the public interest to do so. We do not publish anything that would identify a person under age 18 who has been charged with a crime. This policy is consistent with the Youth Criminal Justice Act. During sentencing, the court will determine whether a ban on identifying a convicted youth should continue after conviction. The law states that a victim under the age of 18 cannot be identified once an accused who is also under 18 has been charged, unless the victim’s parents consent or the victim consents after turning 18. Senior editors should be consulted in cases where naming an underage victim may be newsworthy. Witnesses in a court hearing who are under 18 cannot be identified if the accused is also under 18. Due to an automatic statutory ban, Torstar newsrooms do not publish anything that identifies a child involved in a child protection case, whether that child is a witness, participant or subject of the proceeding, or anything that identifies the child’s parent, foster parent or family member. Statements of claim and defence filed in civil lawsuits are protected by privilege. When we publish a news report based on those pleadings, every effort should be made to contact the other side for comment. If the subject is not available or declines comment, this should be reported prominently. So should a statement that the allegations have not been proven in court. Torstar newsroom staff gather information for only one purpose: to publish. We do not collect information to assist the police or defence, or to aid parties in civil disputes. Editorial staff should report to senior editors any overtures by police or lawyers for assistance on a case. Senior editors and Torstar lawyers should be notified immediately if police try to execute a search warrant in the newsroom or at a staff member’s home, or if a staff member is served with a subpoena. Journalists will protect confidential sources and should be extremely careful about how and where they store information that could identify such sources. Torstar reporters, photographers and videographers are free to gather information or shoot pictures at crimes scenes provided they do not obstruct police officers or firefighters, or disturb or interfere with official activity. Staff should identify themselves to officers and be polite. Police officers do not have the right to confiscate notes or camera equipment. If asked to turn anything over, staff should refuse and immediately consult a senior editor. Senior editors and lawyers should be consulted before publication of stories involving confidential documents that may have been obtained illegally. Staff members must obey the law when pursuing a story. Rarely, the only way to get a story will be to break the law. Such action may be taken only with the prior consent of the newsroom’s most senor editors, and only when the story is of significant public interest. Libel is injury to reputation. Words, pictures or drawings that damage a person’s reputation can be potentially libellous and open our newsrooms to legal action. Such actions usually result from stories that allege crime, fraud, dishonesty, or immoral or unprofessional conduct. The law on libel is complex, but the strongest answer to any libel claim is the truth. In cases where truth may not be accessible, Canadian law recognizes a defence called responsible communication in the public interest, which recognizes that investigative journalism is part of the vital role of the media. The defence has two essential elements: public interest and responsibility. To avail itself of this defence, a media defendant must show that it took reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure the story was fair and the contents accurate. Whatever the defence, we must be accurate and fair in everything we publish. A sincere effort must be made to understand all sides of a story and fairly represent those views. As detailed in our guidelines on fairness, we must give anyone who will be portrayed in an uncomplimentary way, or against whom allegations are being made, a reasonable chance to respond. We should represent documents fairly. Journalists should never cherry-pick information to suit a thesis not supported by the document as a whole, nor distort the overall meaning of a document. We should be wary of sources with axes to grind and always ensure that information from sources whose motives are in question is based in fact and can be verified independently by the journalist. We should ensure any reporting on privileged statements, such as proceedings in the House of Commons, the Senate, provincial legislatures, municipal councils or their committees, courts, public meetings or hearings by public boards and agencies, accurately and fairly reflects those statements. Articles should distinguish between privileged statements and those made outside the event, which are not privileged. The Supreme Court of Canada has also explicitly recognized another defence called “reportage.” This defence is available where there is a public interest in reporting that defamatory allegations were made. This defence may be available where the defamatory allegations are attributed, the story indicates that truth of the allegations has not been verified, the story fairly sets out both sides of the dispute and the story provides the context for the statements made. When libel notices are served against a Torstar publication or staff member, we must note the time and method of service. The appropriate senior editors should be notified immediately and the notice distributed to the publisher, editors, Torstar legal counsel and those involved with that story. An internal report must be assembled as soon as possible after receipt of a libel notice so a decision can be reached as to whether we should publish a retraction or correction. To limit damages, retractions and corrections must be published prominently within three days of receiving the notice. ",0,Torstar Journalistic Standards Guide

"Before it even began, the Munk Debate that pitted former Trump strategist Steve Bannon against conservative commentator David Frum was already steeped in controversy. Now there’s even more. The Munk Debates announced on Saturday that they made a “technical error” in delivering the results of  between Bannon and Frum, after initially announcing that the latter had lost when it had actually been a draw. The debate had already faced criticism, with   the event amid   Bannon’s involvement, including a raucous rally outside Roy Thomson Hall that resulted in the arrest of 12 people. The Munk Debates typically begin with a vote asking the audience to choose whether they are for or against the question at hand. They also ask whether the audience members are open to changing their votes after listening to the debate. At the end, a final vote is done with the same initial for-or-against question. The debater who swayed votes to their side wins. At the end of Friday’s event, they asked the audience whether “the future of western politics is populist, not liberal.” The now-incorrect results showed a clear win for Bannon at 57 per cent in favour and 43 per cent against — a far cry from the corrected tally posted Saturday morning of 28 per cent in favour and 72 per cent opposed, resulting in a draw. “The system involves various people talking behind the scenes,” said Rudyard Griffiths, chairman of the Munk Debates, in an interview with the Star. “There’s one person that’s managing the live poll. That person is communicating with another person who is entering it into a slide, and then another operator is collecting those slides that are displayed on the screen in the hall. So there’s a lot of different moving pieces.” Instead of presenting the numbers in the final vote at Friday’s debate, the tally from the question about whether or not the person’s opinion could be swayed was shown onstage — incorrectly showing that Bannon had won over Frum. It was also the Munk Debates’ first time collecting votes electronically, having used paper ballots in the past, Griffiths added. They will conduct an internal report into how the error was made and how a mistake like this could be prevented. Organizers caught on to the error about five to 10 minutes after the final announcement, but it was too late. “By the time the error had been identified and brought to my attention, the people who were in the hall had left,” Griffiths said. “Some had remained for a post-debate reception and we were able to communicate the results to those people.” Organizers posted an update to their Facebook page after the debate. On Saturday morning, they sent an email to their members and posted the correction on Twitter. While votes tend to sway after debates, draws are not unheard of, Griffiths said. “You’re also talking about a sample of roughly 2,800 people,” Griffiths said. “Some people may change their mind, but other people on the other side may change their minds also. So even though someone’s changed their vote, the net effect of that on the results is negligible.” People were also entering the debate late and missed the vote on the initial questions, having been delayed by the protest outside. J.P. Luisi, who attended the debate, was surprised that the corrected results did not yield a clear winner. “My wife and a few other people that I spoke to changed their vote at the end, so it seemed odd that statistically there wouldn’t be a change,” Luisi said. “It’s like flipping a coin. Theoretically it could land on its edge, but chances are that it will be heads or tales.” Luisi said the audience seemed shocked at the now-incorrect results announced onstage, especially considering the unexpectedly large swing. “There was some murmuring in the crowd briefly and then people afterwords were saying that they were surprised that there was such a change,” Luisi said. “Even people that voted for Bannon were surprised that he would have changed opinion that much.” David Frum posted the Munk Debates’ correction on Twitter.

"The odds seemed stacked against Karla Ogaro ever being a pharmacist again. The Filipino immigrant, who was a certified pharmacist back home, wanted to retrain and get her licence to practise in Ontario, but she was facing major hurdles: She needed $13,000 to enrol in a program at the University of Toronto to complete the process. But pregnant with her second child, she and her husband were living off meagre wages — she as a part-time pharmacy assistant; he in a factory job.  A newcomer with no credit history in Canada, the Mississauga woman tried to get a personal loan from banks — but without success. Then someone told her about a Canadian charity that offers low-interest microloans to help newcomers pay for the training or licensing they need to return to their former professions.  loaned Ogaro $15,000, and it paid off big. Not only did Ogaro obtain her Ontario licence last May, she is now gainfully employed and earning four times more than she did as a pharmacist assistant. “We had used up our savings and didn’t know where we could find the money to pay for the U of T program,” recalled Ogaro, 35, who came to Canada in 2012 under the federal skilled worker program. “This loan has changed my life and made my dream possible.” This month, Windmill, formerly known as Immigrant Access Fund Canada, received a $1 million grant from TD Bank as one of 10 winners of a challenge for fresh ideas to increase income stability and give people the skills for the future economy. “We’re proud to be helping Windmill increase inclusive prosperity and the economic integration of skilled immigrants and refugees,” said Andrea Barrack, vice president of TD’s global corporation citizenship. Windmill was founded in 2005 by Swedish immigrant Maria Eriksen, who came across a group of foreign-trained doctors and nurses working as janitors and cleaners at a Calgary hospital where she worked as a clinical psychologist. She and her friends put in the seed money to give struggling skilled immigrants a leg up to return to their professions. Since its inception, the charity has helped more than 4,000 immigrants and refugees restart their careers in Canada, and many have seen their earnings double or triple as a result. More than half of recipients are in health care, including doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists and medical technicians. The loan repayment rate is 97.5 per cent. “Immigrants bring education, skills and experience that too often go to waste,” said Windmill CEO Claudia Hepburn.  Windmill receives operational funding from the federal government and the provinces of Alberta and Ontario, but its loan capital comes from a special line of credit from the Royal Bank, a community bond program, as well as donations and grants. The TD grant will allow the program to expand its services.  Noorul Hassan Ismail, a nurse from India, was juggling jobs in sales and telemarketing when a $7,000 loan from Windmill made it possible for him to attend a year-long nursing program offered by Mohawk College and McMaster University. “I was studying and working at the same time. Money was a big issue,” said Ismail, 40, who got his licence and was offered a full-time job as a registered practical nurse at a Mississauga hospital in 2016. “The loan is there to help those with a plan so we need not put ourselves in distress.” Mohsen Hassanzadeh, a civil engineer from Iran, received $7,500 from Windmill to enrol in a career-bridging program at U of T, which ultimately allowed him to land a job as a estimator/project manager at a housing company. “Everyday I wondered if I had made a mistake to come to Canada,” said the 44-year-old Thornhill man, whose new job doubled the pay he got from his previous job as a on-site inspector for a Toronto construction company. “The loan has helped me move ahead, pursue my dream and find my way.” ",0,Loan program makes dreams possible for newcomers aiming to upgrade their skills
"Under grey skies and the vaulted ceilings of St. James-the-Less chapel, Dean Lisowick was remembered as someone with a “light that shone from him,” a man who remained generous despite the challenges he faced. Ten months after he was named an alleged victim of accused serial killer Bruce McArthur, friends and acquaintances of Lisowick, 47, gathered for a memorial service Friday, followed by a ceremony in the church’s Rose Garden where his ashes were scattered.  The service spoke of a man who endeared those around him with his kindness, while acknowledging a tragic fact about his final chapter: that Lisowick’s disappearance — sometime in late 2016 or early 2017 — went unreported. “I’m guessing most of us here never knew him in life,” said Rev. Deana Dudley, who led a prayer during the service. “It breaks my heart.” Dudley said Lisowick’s challenges in life, and his death, can nonetheless move individuals to act, and work towards ending some of the factors that made Lisowick particularly vulnerable, including homelessness.  “We need to recommit ourselves to make this a better world,” she said.  Lisowick used the city’s shelter system, and was in and out of the Scott Mission shelter beginning in 2003, sometimes checking in for months at a time, other times disappearing for as long. His last recorded check-in was on April 21, 2016.  Charles Fisch knew Lisowick because he sometimes slept on his street, near Church St. He got to know him, and described him during the service as “lovely and sweet … there was this light that shone from him.”  Fisch said he was moved to attend the funeral after learning that Lisowick hadn’t been reported missing, though he himself had noticed when Lisowick disappeared. “I thought, ‘Oh, I haven’t seen Dean in a while.’ I thought he might have gone home. That was the clincher for me — I couldn’t not come today,” he said. McArthur, 67, is facing eight counts of first-degree murder in homicides alleged to have occurred between 2010 and 2017. Each of the alleged victims had ties to Toronto’s Church and Wellesley area, the Gay Village. Police believe Lisowick was the 6th victim, killed sometime between April 2016 and March 2017. McArthur is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, his first time at the Ontario Superior Court after   to a preliminary hearing at a lower court last month.  Haran Vijayanathan organized the memorial service, in consultation with Lisowick’s daughter, who could not attend the service.  Vijayanathan is the executive director of the Alliance for South Asian AIDS Prevention (ASAAP), an organization that vowed earlier this year to take on the bodies of individuals who were alleged to be among McArthur’s victims, but who were not claimed. When it was determined that the organization could not legally do this, Vijayanathan stepped forward to do so personally.  “People went missing and they were forgotten,” Vijayanathan said. “I didn’t want that to happen in their death. I think it’s important that they are remembered.” Speaking to the Star earlier this year, shelter staff member Julian Picon described Lisowick as someone who “had a rough life, and faced a lot of struggles, he was very respectful.” Picon recalled that Lisowick was attentive, independent, and generous.

"Two men have been charged in a shooting that claimed the life of a 21-year-old Brampton man this summer. Police say the two suspects were arrested Friday and charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Brandon Hall. Police officers responding to reports of a shooting found Hall with no vital signs inside a Brampton home in the early hours of June 21. He was pronounced dead at the scene shortly afterwards. Nineteen-year-old Evan Wright and 21-year-old Philip Fitzpatrick, both from the Brampton area, were scheduled to appear for a bail hearing Saturday. Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to contact them. ",0,Two charged with murder in Brampton shooting that killed 21-year-old man

"In a comped $200 seat, listening to two white middle-aged men, big-braining. Thinking: This would have been a whole lot more fun as a tabloid talk show moderated by Jerry Springer. Would someone please throw a chair? Pull some hair? Accuse Steve Bannon or David Frum of being the two-timing deadbeat father of their baby-mama’s spawn? But no. This is part of the Munk Debates of a Friday evening in Toronto, at staid Roy Thomson Hall, highbrow central. I hear a symphony … In one corner: Mr. Neo Con, when that breed was in the political ascendancy. Writer of George W. Bush speeches and coiner, sorta, of “The Axis of Evil”, nee “The Axis of Hatred”, until an edit, which is kind of like taking credit for “Snap! Pop!” before someone else inserted the “Crackle!” in between. In the other corner, looking like an unmade bed, is the man who concocted President Donald Trump from a petri dish of odium, bile and narcissism. Campaign alchemist-in-chief, lord of the dark side, accelerant of dystopian politics at home and abroad, freelance fomenter now. Have sludge, will travel. Dumped by the White House when the monster had no further need of the master. Vacated — “stepped down” — as executive chairman of alt-right Breitbart News, babble-hub for fervent nativism and white supremacist views. Frum is conservative establishment, for them what likes that kind of thing and a Trump hammerer. Bannon is rabid Anti-Establishment, the outlier who became an insider before Trump punted him. Frum is a senior editor at The Atlantic. Bannon is — what? — an ideological mercenary, on a far-right mission to radicalize Europe, among other time-fillers. Also available, he’s said, to boost the left if strategic expertise is sought. A fox among the fowl. Which might not be such a dumb idea because Big Left has lost its focus, rushing off in all hair-pulling directions. As an intellectual, Frum would probably brighten anybody’s dinner party, although last night’s rant-a-thon was clearly not triggered by him, almost drive-by smeared as an Iraq invasion warmonger. Bannon is all the time getting invited and disinvited from various tall forehead events, depending on how much blow-black the hosts can withstand. Just as the rent-a-demo legions lost their nut when it was announced that Bannon and Frum would be featured in this year’s Munk Debate. The pro and con of: Be it resolved, the future of western politics is populist, not liberal. A legitimate issue as populism surges from Italy to Brazil, even the backwater of Ontario. A platform for hatemongers! Normalizing the fringe abnormal! Ban Bannon! Wonder how the Jews in attendance, heckled by a mob right in their faces as they queued outside, felt about being called F------ NAZIS. Because this audience was decidedly on the con side of the equation. Not merely the protesters who’d infiltrated the auditorium, unfurling go-away banners within 30 seconds of Bannon launching his opening statement. But the 72 per cent who pushed the con button on their interactive thingamajigs before the debate even began. “The only question before us is if it’s going to be populist nationalism or populist socialism,” Bannon posited of a global anti-globalism surge that has brought reactionary parties to power from Italy to Brazil and blaming the elites for the financial crisis that nearly brought the world to its knees in 2008. “Who’s responsible for that? The populists, Donald Trump? No, the elites … the corporate class that runs Washington, D.C. “Donald Trump’s presidency is not the cause of that, it’s the product of that. It was Donald Trump who turned that around.’’ Trump, claimed Bannon, has reversed a country in decline — and that brought hoots of derision. To counter, Frum pointed to the Remembrance Day poppy on his lapel. “These symbols remind us that this is not the first time that democracy has faced thugs and crooks and bullies and would-be dictators and those who seek to pull themselves up by tearing others down. They were wrong then, they are wrong now.’’ Populism, argued Frum, “offers you nothing. It does not respect you. It is anger that draws people to populism, anger and fear.” It’s almost funny, though, mounting a yak-yak challenge between a buttoned-down right winger and a circling Pluto right winger, each allegedly fighting for the soul of the, well, right wing. (Which, as anybody can tell you, has no soul.) Might as well shove Roseanne Barr up there crossing barbs with Kanye West. Neither is a bell-ringer for liberalism, as Frum felt the need to defend himself as not a Liberal, yet asserting the conservative “liberal heritage”. “Populism is a scam, it’s a lie, it’s a fake. It has nothing. Donald Trump is running the most unethical administration in American history.” The GOP, as an aside, has essentially been hijacked by its rump fringe, coalescing around a shambolic megalomaniac. Hence scarcely a peep from ranking Republicans about Muslim bans and separating asylum-seeking parents from their children and calling out the army to stonewall a migrant caravan when it reaches the US-Mexico border. But Bannon zinged back. “This is the oldest trick in the book, smear the populist movement, smear the deplorables. Hillary Clinton tried that. We saw how that turned out. “The populist movement is not racist. They’re the backbone of our country, the most decent people on Earth.’’ Frum, who really is an accomplished debunker, rounded on Bannon. “It is absolutely true that liberal democracy is in trouble right now because of failures that have happened in the past, because of the financial crisis, because of unsuccessful wars. The failures of a good system are not reason to turn to an evil one.” Bannon — surprisingly, he’s not without charm — is a carpetbagger, of course, doubtless thrilled by his notoriety, sucking oxygen from rabid dissenters outside. At least that reinforces his vanity of relevance. As guest speaker at a mid-terms rally in Topeka a couple of days ago, he attracted a crowd of “about 25”. The repent-ye Bible-thumper at Yonge and Dundas draws a larger audience. But maybe it’s different when charging 200 clams per ducat. Then it’s a sold-out affair and let’s meet for cocktails beforehand. I am agnostic on to-Bannon-or-not-to-Bannon. I take no position on his appearance in Toronto. A made-up mind is a bitch of a thing to change anyway. I doubt that any minds shifted last night — no change in pre and post-debate polling numbers. Not outside, not inside. Bannon may be the devil incarnate but there were precious few angels in the vicinity either. This column has been brought to you by FAKENEWS.

"Police were forced to intervene as more than 1,500 protesters delayed the start of a Toronto debate featuring Steve Bannon, the former strategist who helped Donald Trump win the White House. At least three protesters rushed the door at The Munk Debate tonight to chain it shut.  A melee ensued, and the police moved in, reported Toronto Star columnist Rosie DiManno, who was attending the event. Video posted on social media showed officers outside the downtown venue using batons to hold back the crowd, and police tweeted that 12 people had been arrested.  The charges ranged from assault to trespassing and public mischief, Toronto police spokesperson Gary Long told the Star. He also said that two police officers suffered minor injuries. “1 officer hit with a stick, another punched in the face,” police    Long said he isn’t aware of any other injuries. Debate organizers explained the roughly half-hour delay by saying they anticipated protests and wanted to ensure everyone was safe. Bannon was eventually introduced to begin his defence of political populism against conservative commentator David Frum. In his opening statement, interrupted by a shouting protester, Bannon gave a nod to the protesters exercising their free speech rights before laying out his views. Society is on the verge of a “revolution,’’ Bannon said. “It’s not a question of whether populism is on the rise and whether populism is going to be the political future,’’ Bannon said, prompting derisive laughter at times. “The only question before us is it going to be populist nationalism or populist socialism.’’ In his own opening statement, Frum said the new populism promoted by Bannon is a ``scam’’ and a lie, saying so many populist leaders around the world, including Bannon’s former boss, U.S. President Donald Trump, are “crooks.’’ “Does the kind of politics that Steve Bannon is speaking for and President Trump articulates, does that politics offer me anything?’’ Frum said to audience applause. “It offers you nothing. It does not care about you. It does not respect you.’’ Bannon accused critics of populism, and its recent successes in several countries, of resorting to smear tactics. Critics who accuse Bannon of being a white supremacist wanted the debate scrapped. While the 90-minute event at a downtown auditorium was sold out, the theatre was barely half full at the scheduled start time. To ensure the debate went ahead, albeit late, members of the public were seated even after it began. Protesters circled Roy Thomson Hall on Friday night to let Bannon know he was persona non grata in Toronto. The demonstrators called out those who came to see the former Trump strategist and the organizers of the Munk Debates, charging they were helping him to spread the politics of hate and division. “He hates Jews. He hates Blacks. He hates you because of the person you live with, whether you are a lesbian or gay,” organizer Nigel Barriffe yelled into a microphone. “He should be ashamed and he should never have platform in our great city,” said Barriffe, president of the Urban Alliance on Race Relations. Bannon squared off against Conservative commentator David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic Magazine. They debated the resolution, “Be it resolved, the future of western politics is populist, not liberal.” Attendees were greeted by chants of “shame on you” as they stood in line. They were wanded and frisked by security guards as they entered the venue. Bannon’s controversial appearance attracted protesters from more than 40 social-justice organizations, including anti-poverty activists, unionists and defenders of immigrants and refugees. They carried banners and homemade signs with similar messages: “Bannon = Hate,” “Say no to Islamaphobia,” and “Stop racism.” Some signs carried messages like this one, taking aim at those who invited Bannon to Toronto: “Munk Debates: Steve Bannon and David Frum to debate whether hate crimes are better than war crimes.” There was a heavy police presence and organizers say 11 protesters were arrested. Speaker Anna Willats described Bannon and Frum as “two right-wing warmongering peas” in a pod and accused them of spreading neo-liberal and white nationalist ideas.  “We need to organize together to resist the racism and violence that result from the ideas they’re putting forward,” said Willats, who is from the social justice group RadTO. She urged the public to make connections between Bannon’s rhetoric and increasing occurrences of racism, violence and oppression. “The far-right is organizing and we need to stop it,” Willats said. Speaker Cynthia Levine-Rasky paid tribute to the 11 worshippers who were killed by a gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue a week ago. “What happened on Oct. 27 affects all of us...everyone, our common humanity,” she said. We stand together.... Our strength is standing together against the forces that aim to divide us,” Levine-Rasky said.

"A Peel Regional Police officer fired his rifle at an armed Mississauga boy who had tried to rob two businesses and carjack two vehicles before pointing his gun at officers during a standoff with police. These are some of the findings of a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) probe that concluded the officer was justified in shooting and ultimately killing Ozama Shaw, 15, at a Mississauga plaza. Shaw was shot in the stomach on July 27, 2017, but   nearly a month later, on Aug. 26. His weapon turned out to be an unloaded pellet gun, but SIU director Tony Loparco ruled there was no way officers could know that and couldn’t take any chances during the volatile and fluid encounter. The dramatic incident at the Credit Valley Town Plaza unfolded just before 2 a.m. The SIU ruled Shaw was with a group of teens when he tried to rob a Petro Canada gas station attendant in the area at gunpoint, but then “aborted” the heist and tried, unsuccessfully to rob an employee at a Pizza Pizza restaurant in the plaza by pointing “the same black handgun directly at the face of the restaurant employee standing by the cash register.” The employee was aggressive with him and Shaw fled the area. Shaw had come to the area with his group of friends in an Audi sedan that had been reported stolen, the SIU said. The group fled in the Audi and left Shaw behind. Shaw then tried to carjack two vehicles unsuccessfully, with both drivers thwarting the crime by driving away. The woman involved in the first attempted carjacking, along with employees from both businesses, called 911. Several officers responded and found Shaw armed in a BMO. One of the officers, taking cover behind his cruiser, shouted repeatedly at Shaw to put the gun down as the officer had his C8 rifle drawn. According to the SIU ruling, Shaw instead raised the handgun in the direction of the police and he was shot by the officer. The female driver involved in the first attempted carjacking recorded some of the encounter on her smartphone. She can be heard in the recording saying “Oh my God, oh my God, I called you guys not to kill him. Please don’t kill him, please. Oh no wait, no God. Please don’t kill him. Oh my God, this is my fault, I know, guys don’t kill him.” Shaw died in hospital on Aug. 26, 2017. “Numerous emergent and elective surgeries were performed in efforts to stem internal bleeding and to treat systemic infections secondary to the gunshot wound,” SIU director Tony Loparco said in his ruling. It was later determined Shaw had an unloaded pellet gun. But, Loparco ruled, there was no way for the officers to ascertain whether it was a real gun or an imitation and deemed the shooting justified. The officer who shot Shaw “believed that he, or others, were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that he discharged his rifle,” Loparco said. “Furthermore, the (officer) advised that he considered that the incident was taking place in an area where there were numerous civilians and police officers present, as well as residential housing, and as such, the complainant not only posed a danger to the life of the (officer), but to numerous other police officers and members of the public.” Shaw is believed to be among the youngest people killed by police in Ontario. He died at the Hospital for Sick Children   in 30 days to treat a gunshot wound to his abdomen. “They allowed me to go on the bed with him, so I held him,” Kadene, his mother, said in an interview with the Star from her Mississauga home days after her son died. “I still refused to believe, because I didn’t want to let go of my baby. It was the hardest thing to do.” ",0,SIU says Peel officer justified in shooting death of 15-year-old Mississauga boy
"Walking on stage at a downtown hotel to cheers and the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up,” Mayor John Tory, just re-elected with almost 64 per cent of the vote across the city, struck a uniting tone. He told the crowd about a group of moms of Somali descent that he’d met during the campaign, who, sitting in Rexdale with the CN Tower just visible in the distance, felt shut out from the opportunities of Toronto. “All the great things happening in our city seemed quite far away,” Tory told supporters gathered at Sheraton Centre. “It might have well, in some respects, have been happening on the moon.” The mayor pledged in his victory speech that night that “job one” over the next four years will be to “continue the work of connecting Toronto up.” So that no one feels like “opportunity is a distant point on the horizon,” no matter where they live in the city. Tensions between the downtown and suburbs of the megacity Tory will govern for another four years rose to the surface during the chaotic election campaign, which saw Premier Doug Ford chop the wards and councillors almost in half. It was a move which many downtowners perceived as designed to hobble progressive forces on council, as the downtown wards would have had more representation under a planned 47-ward system. But Tory seemed to transcend that divide on election night, winning every ward across the city with a majority of the vote except one (Davenport), and resoundingly defeating his former chief planner Jennifer Keesmaat.  Ward by ward mapping shows a particularly stark contrast in comparison to the support for former mayor Rob Ford, whose support in his 2010 victory formed a virtual doughnut, with a hole in the downtown. Without discounting Tory’s campaign or   which included nods to “downtown” issues like affordable rental housing, experts say he was able to take the entire city because he appealed to stability in an especially chaotic election dominated by another Ford, Doug. Myer Siemiatycki, a professor of politics at Ryerson University, noted incumbents always have the name recognition advantage and this isn’t the first time that a second term mayor has “swept the deck.” Incumbent David Miller had similar broad support in the 2006 election, as did Mel Lastman, who won with about 80 per cent of the vote in 2000. Siemiatycki said he thinks Tory’s victory wasn’t so much about both downtown and the suburbs “preferring his platform and path forward” over Keesmaat’s but more the “peculiarities about this campaign.”  Keesmaat not only “declares and jumps into the fray literally the last day possible,” but after the dust settled on the number of wards, there was just over a month left for campaigning. “It was going to take virtually a political miracle to defeat John Tory under those circumstances,” Siemiatycki said. To his credit, the mayor also hadn’t really alienated any segments or sectors of Toronto.  “I think a lot of this is almost a kind of sweep by default scenario,” Siemiatycki said. “But I think it’s fair to say that John Tory had established a kind of trust confidence threshold that overwhelmingly Torontonians were going to be comfortable with.” Tory was taking some time off to spend with his wife Barb and not available for an interview for this article.  “The Mayor has brought this city together and worked hard to represent every corner of the city and that has shown in how diverse and widespread his support is all across the city,” campaign spokesperson Keerthana Kamalavasan said in a statement, referring to proposed “big projects” such as the relief line subway and Port Lands flood protection. “People voted with the firm belief that John Tory can unite the city and work with the other levels of government to get all this done.” Zack Taylor, assistant professor of political science at Western University in London, Ont., said Tory’s more “consultative and conciliatory” style, especially in relation to Premier Ford, also seemed to resonate with voters over Keesmaat’s attempts to pitch herself as a more “combative” force. “I think that some people are going to be attracted to one message more than the other message and those messages are going to crosscut things like the core-suburb divide,” said Taylor, who is also the director of Western’s Centre for Urban Policy and Local Governance. Tory’s support may have transcended urban-suburban lines. But he’s only one vote on council, and the 25 councillors elected tend to fall across the old stereotypical lines of more conservative voices in the suburbs and left-leaning downtown. More left-leaning councillors who’ve championed issues like bike lanes and affordable housing, such as Kristyn Wong-Tam, Mike Layton and Joe Cressy, were re-elected in their downtown wards, while more conservative ones like Jim Karygiannis in Scarborough-Agincourt and Michael Ford in Etobicoke North took theirs. In his first term, Siemiatycki said, Tory “governed more from the suburbs,” so it will be interesting to see what he does this time. The first big test will be when he picks the members of his executive committee, expected to be before the end of the year.  “If he decides, like last time, to govern exclusively from the suburbs and exclusively from the right of council, then in a way I think that tells us that Mayor Tory has decided not to be the mayor of all Torontonians,” Siemiatycki said. “He’s gotten the vote of all Torontonians, will he govern with all Torontonians?”              ",0,"John Tory unified Toronto — and he can thank Doug Ford for that, experts say"

"“Just look at all those grey facades,” says Udo Schliemann, staring out at the notoriously colourless city that surrounds Nathan Phillips Square.  Schliemann is the principal creative director at Entro, a branding and environmental design firm, and is an advocate of getting colour into design. Earlier this week we went for a city stroll to chat about colour in Toronto. I chose city hall as a meeting spot because, as wonderful as it is, it’s rather colourless, political personalities aside. Yet Schliemann pointed out that the original Viljo Revell design included glass fins that would have lightened up the towers but weren’t possible to construct at the time.  “We are attracted to light and colour,” he says. “Colour draws us in and either creates an affinity or we might hate it.” Colour provokes an emotional reaction or connection, and it isn’t passive. Of the multicoloured Toronto sign in the square he says “it’s kitsch” but that it draws everybody in and is a reminder of why we use colour. Schliemann and Entro have worked on colourful Toronto projects like the Daniels Spectrum in Regent Park and the new Artscape Weston Common hub near Lawrence Ave. and Weston Rd. If you’ve been to the Wychwood Barns you’ll have noticed the five colourful rings on the smokestack. “We wanted something that said this is no longer an industrial site, that there’s something else going on here,” says Schliemann of his work there. At Bay and Queen Sts., we stood across from a TD Canada Trust bank pavilion with a bright green roofline. Schliemann pointed out much of the colour we do get in Toronto is from corporate branding. Architects, he says, focus primarily on form — the shape — of their buildings and neglect colour or include it as an afterthought, even though we desire it. “Buildings are for humans, not architects.” He traced a few hundred years of design history for me, describing how colour is sometimes in fashion, and other times it isn’t. Protestants, for instance, eschewed the baroque and brash colours of Catholic churches and created austere places of worship as a reaction.  However, tastes and fashion are not the only reason we have, or don’t have, colour in the city, and lack of colour isn’t necessarily because designers and architects like greys and browns: getting colour into the public realm can be tricky, just like those city hall fins were. “Colour can be difficult to handle,” he says. “That’s why artists often reduce colour and work monochromatically.” He laments that architects might only take one course on colour in school, so the skills needed to find colours that are durable and work together in public are rare. In Toronto, some of our regulations get in the way too: while working on the “Downtown Yonge” signage that appears on poles from Yonge-Dundas Square north to Gerrard St., the vertical “YONGE” lettering was originally multicoloured but as it might have interfered with traffic lights it was changed to all blue. Some cities seem effortlessly colourful. Schliemann mentioned Halifax and Montreal’s Plateau neighbourhood as being rather colourful, while cities such as Paris, Chicago and Tokyo can be as grey as Toronto. I wonder if the painted wooden houses in St. John’s might make it the most colourful city in Canada? Toronto does have its moments though. Along Adelaide St., Schliemann paused to admire the south-facing brick facade of the Hudson’s Bay store framed in between the two new glass towers of the Bay Adelaide Centre. A little further east, at Jarvis, he looked south towards the brick buildings in the oldest part of Toronto. “We’ve got to be better at protecting these kinds of buildings,” Schliemann says. “They ground us.” Indeed, when it comes to colour in the city Toronto’s bricks  , often a result of a particular brickyard’s manufacturing process and the clay or shale used. Variations of brown, yellow, white and red bricks can be found. I asked if Toronto has a natural colour of its own. “The city’s official colour is blue, but I don’t think it has one,” Schliemann says. “Each nation that has come here brings their own colours and when they have a festival, those are Toronto’s colours.” We finished our stroll at the corner of Isabella and Jarvis Sts. in front of Casey House, the HIV-AIDS hospital that recently completed a modern addition to a handsome 1875 heritage building that was called the “Grey Lady” as its now-revealed brilliant red bricks were painted grey for years. Schliemann and his firm created the backlit sign along Jarvis with rectangular panels in different hues of red. “Red can mean danger,” he says. “But it also means love, warmth and compassion.” At night, it’s a bright streak along a dark and fast stretch of Jarvis, the kind of warm, human beacon Toronto could use more of.

"Just days after Jennifer Keesmaat cycled to city hall and dramatically signed up at the last minute to challenge John Tory in Toronto’s mayoral race, she was surrounded by advisers in her midtown kitchen. The ad hoc group assembled around her, according to two people who were there, were comprised of a collection of NDPers, including Councillor Joe Cressy, a smattering of Liberals, including MP Adam Vaughan, now re-elected councillor Shelley Carroll and several of former premier Kathleen Wynne’s staff members who would later be visible on Keesmaat’s campaign. A “kitchen cabinet” of sorts, they came to one conclusion: the ballot question had to be about  nearly in half without warning. It had to be about which candidate could better stand up to a bully. In the end, sources say, the campaign team that later assembled all but abandoned that narrative. Several agreed that, overall, it was Keesmaat’s team that let down Toronto’s former chief planner. The Star is not naming sources who requested anonymity because their positions do not allow them to speak freely about confidential campaign information. In the wake of a  in Monday night’s election, those both on the periphery and inside the campaign say the lack of time Keesmaat had to make her pitch made the gap nearly impossible to close. But attacking Tory more than focusing on a fight with Ford, and failing to lay out her vision for the city, hurt her case. Since 2017, Toronto progressives had calls and meetings trying to identify a progressive standard-bearer. Those who said no included Vaughan, former Toronto deputy police chief Peter Sloly, Councillor Mike Layton, retired sports executive Richard Peddie and Keesmaat, confirmed multiple sources who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity. Until the morning of July 27, when Ford confirmed his plan to slash the size of city council and Tory responded with what many saw as a meek response, Keesmaat was firmly against running, say all those who spoke to the Star. Tory, a conservative first elected in 2014, had no serious challenger. The candidate search instantly restarted with a flurry of phone calls. Layton and Vaughan seemed to have considered the question but again said no, said a source on the calls. Keesmaat, after a conference call with family members, said yes, triggering her trip to city hall and answering the prayers of progressives who feared Ford’s toll on Toronto if Tory insisted on playing nice with the premier. Her supporters — she walked into the race with no team — hoped they could catch lightning in a bottle. “In the end this was not Jennifer’s race to win,” Cressy said in an interview. “The biggest lesson is that mayoralty campaigns require exceptional organization and preparation, that launching a campaign before the wings are on the plane is extremely difficult.” A seasoned team was quickly assembled, eventually moving out of her Chaplin Estates home — a mix of former Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty staffers, Wynne staffers and seasoned NDPers. Her campaign manager was Brian Topp, the former chief of staff to Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley. Most did not know Keesmaat and were less familiar with city hall politics than Tory’s mix of Liberals and Conservatives. Keesmaat herself drove the policy that was released, with the team at first slow on the uptake to distil her detailed ideas into platform planks that were palatable to the public, one insider said. It included a rent-to-own housing program, turning city-run golf courses into more accessible public spaces and a push for gender equity on city boards and commissions. The initial rollout was slow. Over the course of just over 60 days, she made about a dozen major announcements. After the first announcement on Aug. 7  , she did not return with another pitch to voters until Aug. 30, 23 days later, rolling out  . In the first announcement on affordable housing, the successful businesswoman and former chief planner, who is in demand for speeches worldwide, relied on notes and speaking points in front of her — something insiders say was a repeated mistake. One political observer said the voters who don’t remember her from her city hall days never got to see the real Keesmaat — a planner obsessed with evidence and details, who talks easily and inspirationally about transit-oriented development and complete communities. “All that was missing,” said one source who observed the campaign from the periphery, noting the campaign got Keesmaat speaking on an NDP message track instead of Keesmaat finding a team to rally around her own confident, unique vision. Another tactical error, sources said, was the focus on attacking Tory. Three to four weeks into the campaign, a team meeting to regroup on messaging happened in a boardroom at DIALOG — the planning consultancy that encompassed the firm started by Keesmaat before she became chief planner. Keesmaat rehearsed a new stump speech slagging Tory, which some in the room said was too off-brand. Those in attendance were divided over whether attacking Tory as a primary campaign tactic was the right move. The team also failed, one source said, to slap Tory for his refusal to debate Keesmaat one-on-one. A chicken suit was ordered to shame him but its arrival, the source said, was delayed by customs. It was eventually used briefly to no effect.  Keesmaat’s team, the same source said, also failed to capitalize on Ford’s decision to invoke the notwithstanding clause to overrule a court judgement that blocked his legislation cutting the size of council to 25 wards. Another source said: “Jennifer’s not an attack dog . . . I feel like she was limited to really transmitting who she was as a leader.” One insider noted Keesmaat was struggling in the limelight to transform from urbanist speaker and ex-bureaucrat to hard-hitting politician. “She was trying to find her own voice as a politician too,” one source told the Star, acknowledging Keesmaat frequently stuck to talking points in the beginning. “It was an entirely new thing for her.” Meanwhile, the campaign only ever really mounted an “air war” — messaging — without any serious efforts to mobilize a ground game to get signs in yards and identify voters to get to the polls.  Keesmaat did not agree to an interview for this story. Chris Ball, a former Ontario NDP communications staffer and principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group, who ran Keesmaat’s war room, told the Star he feels good about the campaign they ran. “It started on the last day for registration and we did build a bit of a movement behind us,” he said. “I think getting around 25 per cent of the vote is actually a good showing for a campaign that had less time than the incumbent. We took on a popular incumbent and Doug Ford dominated the race for about two-and-a-half weeks.” Keesmaat also had advice on key policy from the likes of Sloly, and those with business acumen like former MLSE boss Peddie.  “We had a mayor who has never really stopped campaigning since the day he got elected four years ago. He’s a photo-op waiting to happen,” said Peddie. Tory was, he said, the safe candidate in an uncertain time for the city under Premier Ford.  “Time was not an ally for her. When she started she didn’t have an office, she didn’t have a (campaign) phone. She was starting from nothing and that had to hurt. Would a couple of more months made a difference? Sure it would have. Would it have been enough to beat a safe-looking incumbent? Probably not.”  Throughout, one insider said Keesmaat remained “upbeat” as volunteers and residents said they were compelled to get involved for the first time because of her candidacy. Peddie said she was “very happy with the team around her.” The source who was critical of the campaign’s tactics made clear Keesmaat herself was a “solid candidate” full of confidence and poise. “In some ways, what she did from a dead start was pretty remarkable,” that source said. Another source with outside knowledge of the campaign said Keesmaat never really had a fighting chance — that there was likely no progressive candidate who could have bested Tory. “In this city, unless you’re a crack-smoking mayor you’re pretty safe for two terms, and I’m not convinced Rob (Ford) couldn’t have been re-elected.” ",0,Why Jennifer Keesmaat’s mayoral campaign never took flight
"A perfect storm led to a sharp decline in Toronto’s voter turnout, down to 41 per cent. Just one election ago, in 2014, Toronto set a record at 60 per cent of eligible voters hitting the polls, marking the highest voter turnout since amalgamation.  “It’s almost like falling off a cliff,” said Myer Siemiatycki, a politics professor at Ryerson University, adding that it shouldn’t come as a surprise. “You couldn’t have designed an election to have a lower voter turnout.”  Voter turnout for the Toronto election is an unofficial estimate not confirmed by the city, but based on city data. The city will release official results later this week, a spokesperson said. One of the reasons why turnout was low is likely because candidates didn’t know for sure where their ward boundaries would be until mid-September, when  the election should proceed with 25 wards, as legislated by Premier Doug Ford’s government, rather than the planned 47. That meant candidates had half the time to cover twice the geography and didn’t reach enough residents, Siemiatycki said. Then there’s the mayoralty campaign that saw the “very belated” entry of Jennifer Keesmaat in late July, he said. Unlike the 2014 election that saw a close race between high profile candidates including John Tory, Olivia Chow and Ford, Keesmaat didn’t have the same name recognition, or “organizational robustness” to help her make up lost time. And an uncompetitive mayoral election is almost always a formula for low voter turnout, said Michael McGregor, also a politics professor at Ryerson. Tory’s win, predicted in early polls, proved to be a “blowout” as he attracted about 63.5 per cent of votes.  An easy win appears to have impacted Mississauga’s voter turnout too, with incumbent  to victory. Voter turnout was just 27 per cent, according to the city.  During the Hazel McCallion era, when the long-time Mississauga mayor seemed destined to win again and again, as few as 20 per cent of voters would cast a ballot.  Brampton’s voter turnout in this election is higher than Mississauga’s, unofficially at 34.5 per cent, reported the city. That’s with a feisty mayoral race that featured former PC leader Patrick Brown defeating incumbent Linda Jeffrey.  For at least the past decade, Brampton’s voter turnout percentage has remained in the mid to low 30s (in 2014 it peaked at 36 per cent). Even when the race has “a very high-profile set of candidates, the turnout is still below Toronto’s worst effort,” McGregor said. A number of factors contribute to the 905’s lower voter engagement in municipal politics. There’s a “black hole” or lack of information in the Peel Region, with media outlets covering almost exclusively Toronto politics, said McGregor. And there’s the fact Mississauga and Brampton are hubs of diversity. “Research suggests immigrants and visible minorities vote at relatively low levels in municipal elections in particular,” McGregor said. He’s currently trying to figure out why in his research. Compared to the “thicker network” of civic engagement in old city centres like Toronto, suburban life is “more individualized and private with not as many bonds that bind residents to each other and their community,” Siemiatycki said. “As you fan out from the downtown core to the older suburbs and then further out to Brampton, Mississauga, Vaughan and Markham, voter turnout decreases.” Voter turnout tended to be higher in the downtown wards, with the exception of Ward 10, Spadina—Fort York where Councillor Joe Cressy, not facing any incumbents, easily beat out the 13 other candidates. Only 37 per cent of that ward’s voters cast a ballot.  The two wards that tied for highest voter turnout at 50 per cent were both close to downtown. Ward 12, Toronto—St. Paul’s saw Councillor Josh Matlow beat out Joe Mihevc, who was endorsed by Mayor John Tory. In Ward 14, Toronto-Danforth, Councillor Paula Fletcher bested former council ally Mary Fragedakis. Voter turnout tended to be lower in the city’s most northern wards from Etobicoke North across to Scarborough—Rouge Park.  The open race in Ward 23, Scarborough North had the lowest voter turnout at 33 per cent. Cynthia Lai won with 27 per cent of votes cast. Low voter turnout shouldn’t be accepted as a given and is detrimental to the quality of local government, McGregor said. “You want your elected representative to reflect interests of as many people possible and if a small share of the population is voting that’s not going to happen.”  ",0,Toronto’s 2018 voter turnout falls sharply from last election
"The dust has settled: 44 has become 25.  Monday’s   was the first under the new ward boundaries brought in by the provincial government, a decision that cut the number of seats — which had been set to increase to 47 from 44 — roughly in half. As a result, the city saw not only brand new candidates fighting for a position, but also incumbent councillors facing off against each other in whirlwind campaigns to remain on council.  In the shakeup, some who have held positions on council for years found themselves on the cutting room floor.  After serving 44 years on council, Norm Kelly was defeated by fellow veteran politician Jim Karygiannis in Scarborough-Agincourt. Karygiannis has been in Scarborough politics for three decades, and picked up around 47 per cent of the vote over Kelly’s 37 per cent.  Controversial and longtime councillor Giorgio Mammoliti was ousted by rival incumbent Anthony Perruzza after their old North York wards were combined. And Joe Mihevc, a councillor since 2000 in the old Ward 21, lost to former Ward 22 councillor Josh Matlow in the new Ward 12, Toronto—St. Paul’s. There were only two city wards without incumbent councillors running for the seat. In Beaches—East York, newcomer Brad Bradford pulled off a win over the presumed front-runner Matthew Kellway, who had the backing of outgoing councillor Janet Davis. Cynthia Lai won the other open seat in Scarborough North.  And one new-to-city hall challenger managed to successfully defeat the incumbent councillor in their area: Jennifer McKelvie won the seat in Ward 25, Scarborough—Rouge Park, with only 154 more votes than incumbent Neethan Shan. It remains to be seen how the new, smaller city council will handle issues that come with larger boundaries and bigger populations per ward, with many councillors now responsible for more than 100,000 people.

"A man shot and killed in Downsview Thursday afternoon has been identified as Roy Zamora, a 26-year-old Ryerson student.  Police responded to a call shortly after 2 p.m., to sounds of gunshots at Camborne Ave. and Dalraith Rd., in the area of Sheppard Ave. W. and Keele St. in North York. Police found the victim unresponsive and with gunshots to his upper body. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Police say two male suspects were last seen leaving the area in a grey vehicle, driving east. City councillor for Ward 9, Maria Augimeri, spoke to the victim’s mother and family members after the shooting. The victim’s mother, who lost her husband to cancer almost nine years ago, said she’s alone now, Augimeri said.  The killing is Toronto’s 85th homicide of the year.

"Mayor John Tory will have a slim majority on a new council — now broken into 25 wards — with a majority of conservative voices elected in mostly suburban wards. He will be forced to carry out another four-year mandate — one with an agenda that was not clearly defined by this campaign — with a balance of power that hinges on less than a handful of votes. Fourteen votes are now needed on the total 26-seat council to win a vote (all votes lose on a tie). Tory and right-leaning councillors appear to have enough votes in a bloc that includes several wild cards. That includes Brad Bradford, the city hall bureaucrat who just sneaked past former New Democrat MP Matthew Kellway to win by just 288 votes. His victory came after a strong endorsement from Tory that may have made the difference in that race. Bradford has said he doesn’t have any clear political stripes.  The election follows one of the most tumultuous campaigns in the city’s history as a result of the interference from Premier Doug Ford on the final day of nominations in July, when the province  . In the end, the race wasn’t close for Josh Matlow, who, like 21 other council hopefuls across the city, battled a fellow incumbent — in his case for the Toronto—St. Paul’s seat in the heart of the city. “We have a common foe and that is a dishonest populist who is the premier of Ontario, who disregarded our local democracy (and) was willing to ignore our charter rights to settle scores,” an elated Matlow told a crowd of supporters at a midtown gastro-pub after a heated race that saw Tory unsuccessfully back Matlow’s challenger Joe Mihevc late in the campaign.  “Neither Joe or I would have wanted to find ourselves in this situation,” Matlow said. Now that Tory is headed back to the mayor’s chair after railing against left-wing, “radical” candidates and their ideas, his earlier   to work closer with those representatives largely in downtown areas will be put to the test. The election with fewer wards has left Tory with just half of the councillors he previously appointed to his 13-member executive committee. Those re-elected include deputy mayor Denzil Minnan-Wong (Don Valley East) and Michael Thompson (Scarborough Centre). “This was a nastier campaign than I had expected, but our campaign took the high road and I think at the end we had … quite a convincing victory,” Minnan-Wong said. He beat out former Liberal MPP David Caplan, who was backed by ex-premier Kathleen Wynne and what Minnan-Wong called the “Liberal machine.” Executive member James Pasternak won out over longtime progressive Maria Augimeri in York Centre, securing another safe vote for Tory on most issues. “This was not the election that the people wanted,” Augimeri said, referring to the council cuts. “I’ve done this job as a sort of religion. For me it’s been a calling.” On the progressive bench, veterans such as Gord Perks (Parkdale—High Park) and Kristyn Wong-Tam (Toronto Centre) were easily returned to their seats, as was Joe Cressy (Spadina—Fort York). As in Toronto—St.Paul’s, two like-minded councillors went head to head in Toronto-Danforth, with Paula Fletcher besting Mary Fragedakis for the seat.  The election also spelled the end to Giorgio Mammoliti’s long city hall career, with Anthony Perruzza taking over in Humber River—Black Creek. Over, too, was Norm Kelly’s decades-long stint as a Scarborough councillor, as he was beat by rookie Jim Karygiannis, previously the MP for the Scarborough-Agincourt area. Neethan Shan, who had won a byelection in February 2017, was toppled by newcomer Jennifer McKelvie in Scarborough—Rouge Park by a difference of just 154 votes — the closest margin of any race. Christin Carmichael Greb, also a first-term councillor and supporter of the mayor, lost in Eglinton-Lawrence to former Liberal MPP Mike Colle — also a former city councillor, and the father of outgoing councillor Josh Colle. Cynthia Lai will be another new face on council in Scarborough North. She was endorsed by Progressive Conservative MPP and former councillor Raymond Cho. She served on the Toronto Real Estate Board and the city’s committee of adjustment, but has yet to put her politics on display. Though Ana Bailao (Davenport) is considered a progressive voice, she is a go-to member of Tory’s team, and her support for the initiatives of her downtown colleagues is uncertain after her re-election. Scarborough-Guildwood winner Paul Ainslie, who was named to Tory’s executive at the beginning of the last term, has differed with the mayor on several big issues, including the Scarborough subway and the rebuilding of the eastern Gardiner Expressway. The Scarborough subway will be back up for debate early in the new term. There are few on council now who supported the premier’s last-minute election interference. Yet they will all be forced to grapple with a significant restructuring of council and how it does business, including the community councils that deal with daily constituent issues like parking pads and tree removals.

"The Toronto District School Board is poised for a major turnover following Monday’s elections because about half of its trustees are newly-elected.  “Change can be positive,” said Robin Pilkey, chair of the TDSB. “Four years ago there was significant change on the board and the TDSB hit the re-set button. Today, the board has greater integrity and accountability in governance and a sharper more united focus in improving student achievement for all students.  “I hope that, together with the many fresh faces on the board, we can continue to build on this work,” says Pilkey, who was re-elected as trustee in Ward 7. The fresh faces include Dan MacLean (Ward 2), Patrick Nunziata (Ward 3), Christopher Mammoliti (Ward 4), Stephanie Donaldson (Ward 9), Rachel Chernos Lin (Ward 11), James Li (Ward 13), Trixie Doyle (Ward 14), Michelle Aarts (Ward 16), Zakir Patel (Ward 19), Yalini Rajakulasingam (Ward 21) and Anu Sriskandarajah (Ward 22). “I am very excited,” said Aarts. “I really want to get in and make a difference (at) the board. I want to see a board that operates well, is accountable to teachers and its families in how it delivers education.” The turnover in Canada’s largest board was largely because about half of the trustees on the 22-member board — including longtime trustees Gerri Gershon and Sheila Cary-Meagher — did not seek re-election. Incumbents Alexandra Lulka (Ward5), Chris Tonks (Ward 6), Shelley Laskin (Ward 8), Chris Moise (Ward 10), Alexander Brown (Ward 12), Jennifer Story (Ward 15), David Smith (Ward 17), Parthi Kandavel (Ward 18) and Manna Wong (Ward 20) were re-elected. Former mayor Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver Alexander (Sandro) Lisi, who was part of a police investigation into Ford, ran in Ward 1. In that race, which had no incumbent, Harpreet Gill won.  In a major upset at the Toronto Catholic District School Board, trustee and chair Barbara Poplawski (Ward 10) was defeated by Daniel Di Giorgio. Other incumbents who lost were Sal Piccininni (Ward 3), who was defeated by Ida Li Preti, and Ann Andrachuk (Ward 4), who was defeated by Teresa Lubinski. At the Catholic board, which has 12 trustees, incumbents such as Joseph Martino (Ward 1), Maria Rizzo (Ward 5), Frank D’Amico (Ward 6), Mike Del Grande (Ward 7), Garry Tanuan (Ward 8), Angela Kennedy (Ward 11) and Nancy Crawford (Ward 12) were re-elected. “I am surrounded by parents, teachers and families that supported me throughout this election campaign,” said Rizzo. “I am blessed to have had them, and I am honoured to be the school trustee for the next four years. My priorities are to put children before politics and to help all parents. St. Thomas More is the patron saint of politicians. He was praying for all of us.” TCDSB races without an incumbent saw newcomers Norm Di Pasquale (Ward 9) and Markus de Domenico (Ward 2) elected. At the Durham District School Board, trustee Michael Barrett, the board’s chair and trustee for the C​ity of Oshawa was re-elected.  “The role of trustee will be a difficult one as we move through a redirection and a new government,” said Barrett. “We have only begun to see the changes and public education is an institution that needs careful attention.”  At the Peel District School Board, Janet McDougald, retired after three decades as a trustee (Wards 1 and 7 in Mississauga) and 20 years as board chair. At time of publication, John Marchant was leading the race to replace her as trustee. At the York Region District School Board, votes were also still being tabulated at time of publication. Trustee Anna DeBartolo (Ward 1 & 2 Vaughan), was in the lead. Meanwhile, YRDSB trustee Linda Aversa (Ward 3 & 4 Vaughan) was trailing Elizabeth Sinclair in a tight race.  Cathy Abraham, president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association is looking forward to working with the 317 trustees elected to its member boards, 77 of whom were acclaimed. “Public schools are at the heart of their communities,” says Abraham. “They connect students, parents, teachers, school staff, citizens and locally elected school board trustees together in support of a common goal – building bright futures for students. This is why it’s so important for voters to help shape society’s future and vote for school board trustees.” : For up-to-the-minute results, visit the Star’s  .

"Alleged serial killer  has been remanded in custody until Oct. 22 after appearing briefly in court Friday via video.

"If you kill someone with a gun in Toronto — you have a three in five chance of getting away with murder. This startling statistic comes directly from Toronto police. If you use any other weapon, your chances of being charged skyrocket. Why are so many gun homicides unsolved in Toronto?  Metroland Media’s investigative team spoke to police, community activists and academics to try to identify the barriers, and some possible solutions. In this  , we tell the stories of Demal Graham and Kiesingar Gunn, two young men shot to death in the prime of their lives. No one has been charged in their murders. People know who killed Demal Graham — about that, Shauna Brown is certain. Brown started hearing rumours a couple of months after her son, a shy man devoted to making music in his basement studio,  . Graham, 25, was watching his daughter playing on townhouse steps across the street when a car came circling by on Empringham Drive in Malvern. Police later told Brown they didn’t think her son was an “intended target.” Maybe he was just the first man his killers saw. But more than a year later, he’s dead and they’re still anonymous, except, Brown believes, to a sizable number of people who know something but won’t tell, because that would mean “snitching.” Some are “close enough to have known me. Some of these people have been inside my home. They knew my granddaughter, they know my girls,” said Brown. “There’s a lot of people who know the answer, and we don’t.” To Brown, struggling with anxiety and depression after her son’s death, people keeping the killers’ secrets are “no better than the person who pulled the trigger,” she said. “They have kids, they have sons, they have grandchildren. How would they feel if this happened to them?” Brown moved her family away from Empringham, where they lived for 12 years, and where her son attended barbecues, and participated in countless water fights. She distanced herself and her family from many friends, even some relations. She said her son’s case “could be solved at any time,” if certain people broke free from “the pull of the street mentality” and gave information to police. If people stay silent because of the code against “snitching,” said Brown, using a common term for co-operating with police, they’re promoting more violence and serving men like the one who fired the fatal shots at Graham. “This person is out free, walking the streets. They’re giving more loyalty to this person who shot and killed my son than to the memory and life of my son. It’s cowardly.” Music became an outlet for Graham — called Milli by many — after his father died when he was 12. He wanted to start a children’s music program in Malvern. He kept to himself a lot, sitting on his steps, writing down his problems and turning them into songs.  If you got to know him, Graham was really funny, said Janese Davis, a longtime friend and neighbour. “He was someone you could definitely confide in,”  When he got shot, a friend called Davis. “She’s like, ‘Demal’s gone.’ That was definitely the last person for me to think would be ever be gone like that,” she remembered last month. “He was never that type of guy.” Davis’s favourite track of Graham’s is one he recorded for his daughter,  , in which Graham sings he wants to shield her from violence and would do anything for her. It could be true people know who killed him, Davis said. “In the community, when certain people know certain things, they don’t want to be labelled as a snitch.” “No snitching,” she believes, is rooted in the same “ego and pride” which sets many shootings off, the idea that, “if someone stepped on my shoes, I’m going to kill you for that,” Davis said. “At the end of the day, a bullet doesn’t have a name to it, so a bullet can kill anybody.” Early on the day Graham was murdered, two other men, Dwayne Campbell, 30, and Rinaldo Cole, 33, were also shot to death during a crowded barbecue party on Gennela Square, a Morningside Heights street a short distance from Empringham. Those shooters, whose gunfire also wounded a woman, haven’t been caught either. Brown wants the public to know it wasn’t just her family who has suffered, but a whole neighbourhood. She knows people may be afraid to talk.  “But we have to testify (once the shooters are caught). On top of being victimized once, we have to go through the whole process. To me, there’s no excuse why someone else couldn’t do the same thing.” She has never wanted revenge, she said. That just “perpetuates the cycle” and would force another mother to go through what she’s gone through. But Brown wants justice for Graham, for her granddaughter most of all. “She got the least amount of time with him, and she’ll deal with the effects the rest of her life,” said Brown. “My family and the family of the person who killed my son, we’re now connected, and we’ll be for the rest of our lives.”  “Stop worrying about me. ... Nothing’s going to happen to me.” Those were Kiesingar Gunn’s final words to his mother.  Three days later, the 26-year-old father of four was dead,  Evelyn Fox said she was watching the news on Sept. 8, 2016, when she turned to her son and warned him not to get into arguments with anyone because “people carry guns.” It was then that Gunn told his mother not to worry, assuring her that nothing would happen to him. “And that was our last conversation,” Fox said. “It haunts me.” Gunn, the oldest of four children, was born May 2, 1990. He grew up in the Jane and Finch area until age 10 when he moved to Scarborough’s West Hill neighbourhood with his family. “He was very loving but very adventurous and accident prone,” Fox said in a recent interview. “He was adventurous to the point where I had numerous hospital visits for broken bones, stitches, you name it.” Gunn played baseball and football; it was during football games that he broke his clavicle bone and nose. Fox noted her son loved to play pranks on his family. “He was forever trying to make people laugh and bring a joke to a situation. He was very heartwarming like that.” And Gunn also took good care of his two youngest siblings. “Kiesingar was 14 and he was not only a big brother but almost like a father figure to them. He used to take the kids to daycare and from daycare when I was working and going to school,” Fox said. “And then he would have dinner made for them, give them a bath and everything before I even got home.” Gunn went to Sir Robert L. Borden Business and Technical Institute and volunteered at Variety Village. After graduating high school, Gunn went straight into the workforce. He worked for a roofing company and a racking company up until his death. “I finally talked him into going back to post-secondary school, and he was supposed to start a home renovation program in the September that he passed away,” Fox said. Gunn was engaged to his girlfriend, who he had three of his four children with. Fox described her son as “the most amazing” father. “The kids were glued to him because he was so playful,” she said. “If one kid wanted spaghetti for dinner and another one wanted hamburgers and the other one wanted something else, he would make all three different meals. He was just that type of father: very engaged, hands-on.” Gunn rarely went to clubs though he had been to the Forty2 Supperclub twice and liked it enough to return a third time for a birthday party with his fiancée and a man Fox described as her son’s godbrother. A fourth person, the godbrother’s friend, also went with them. It was 4 a.m. Sept. 11, 2016 when Gunn, his fiancée and his godbrother left the club and saw a commotion outside; a crowd had formed around two men who were arguing.  “My godson happened to notice that his friend was in the crowd, the friend that they ended up going to the club with,” said Fox, noting her godson pulled over the van and walked towards the crowd to get his friend. Gunn also got out of the vehicle and approached the crowd of 20 to 30 people.  “And within seconds he was hit by a stray bullet,” Fox said. “He was just going to stand close by, just to make sure that nothing happened with my godson.” Gunn, shot in the head, was taken to St. Michael’s Hospital where he died at 9:25 p.m. that day. Police confirmed Gunn wasn’t the intended target of the shooting. Police and Fox believe there are witnesses who know the identity of the killer.  Fox said that not having justice for her son’s death has made it hard to move on. “It (an arrest) would at least help me try to heal. I wouldn’t be harbouring all this anger that prevents me from even attempting to heal.” There has been a recent attempt to reinvigorate the investigation. On the second anniversary of the murder,  . Det. Leslie Dunkley told reporters at the time that prior to the shooting the suspect was among more than 200 patrons inside the club. “After the shots were fired, (the suspect) fled to a waiting vehicle that was parked on Mowat Avenue, and the vehicle proceeded northbound towards Liberty Street,” he said, adding there was someone there “that can identify the shooter and that knows the shooter ... and we’re asking that those individuals come forward.” The suspect is black with a dark complexion, 18 to 22 years old, five feet 11 inches to six-feet tall with braided hair, possibly in cornrows, and a slim build. He wore a white hooded sweatshirt with black prints or a logo. “If he has any type of moral compass at all, if his mother raised him with any type of morals or ethics period, then the right thing for him to do is to turn himself in,” Fox said. As for why more witnesses haven’t yet come forward, Fox suggested “fear” could be part of the problem. “I don’t know if it’s fear from their community (or) fear from that person, but this guy is not the mafia, he’s not a hit man,” she said. “I don’t understand why it is people would be fearful, maybe of their reputation. Is someone’s reputation more important than a person’s life?” ",0,If you shoot someone dead in Toronto — you have a three in five chance of getting away with murder
"The   at his home last week suggests that the New York State mob still has considerable influence in the southern Ontario underworld, sources say. “I don’t think anyone knows for certain how this plays out,” said Paul Manning, a former Hamilton undercover police officer who worked on organized crime investigations. “One thing’s for sure, Buffalo will always have a say north of the border.” Iavarone, 50, was shot dead in the midst of a dispute between two Niagara Region groups of mobsters who are both tied to the New York State mob, several former southern Ontario organized crime police investigators said. Buffalo would have to give approval for high-level killings, sources said, adding that mob leaders there are believed to have turned their backs on one side in the dispute and given tacit approval to the other.  “They’re all supposed to be under Buffalo,” one source said of the two feuding Ontario crime factions. “This does not end well for anyone,” the former police organized crime specialist said. Iavarone’s killer hid in bushes outside his detached home at on Sunflower Cres. in Ancaster’s quiet Scenic Woods neighbourhood, shooting him around 9:55 p.m. as he walked from his car.

Iavarone didn’t take part in Musitano’s murder but he was close to one of the suspected killers, a source said. Musitano was shot at close range several times while in his truck outside his home while his wife and children waited inside for him.  Years earlier, Musitano and his brother Pasquale (Pat) were convicted of conspiracy related to the 1997 murder of Niagara Falls mobster Carmen Barillaro. “This (Iavarone murder) is for Ang,” one former investigator said. “This is retaliation for Ang.” Iavarone didn’t have a criminal record. He was known to police because he was “associated to individuals involved in traditional organized crime in the Hamilton area,” Det.-Sgt. Peter Thom of the Hamilton police said hours after his murder. “It’s our belief that there is something going on in the underworld, maybe a power struggle,” Thom said. Some of Iavarone’s underworld ties were south of the border, sources said. “The recently deceased had ties to New York,” a former police investigator said. “Buffalo factions of Traditional Organized Crime are not ‘in’ Canada per se, but historically have controlled aspects of Canadian ‘family business’ and do get kickbacks from profits from illicit activity,” Manning said. Prior to his death, Musitano was owed money from a man involved in gambling who worked for New York State mobsters, a source said. When he demanded payment or a piece of the gambling operation, he was murdered by a crew of Niagara Region men connected to the gambler, the sources said. None of the men involved in the Angelo Musitano murder were actual mob members, leaving them vulnerable to retaliation, the source said.  They have already been cut astray by the New York mob, a police source said. “They have no backing,” the source said. ",0,"Buffalo mob playing role in deadly Ontario dispute, sources say"

"Last month, Reese Fallon graduated from Malvern Collegiate Institute with the admiration of teachers and friends, excited to start nursing school at McMaster University in the fall. That bright future was extinguished on Sunday night, when the 18-year-old was killed in a shooting rampage on the Danforth that has left her family and friends mourning the loss of a “whip smart” young woman with a “magnetic” personality.  Another young victim, a 10-year-old girl who died, has not yet been identified. Thirteen people remain in hospital with injuries ranging from minor to critical.  In a tribute on Instagram, Fallon’s younger sister said she was “crushed” by the loss of her “lifelong best friend.”  “You had so much going for you. You are so smart, funny, kind, caring, beautiful and that’s why I know you are a perfect angel,” she wrote. “You were in the wrong place at the wrong time and you were the victim of this story.” Fallon, who lived in Toronto’s leafy Beach neighbourhood, not far from Malvern, was “an engaging student” who was “highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends,” said John Malloy, director of education for the Toronto District School Board, in a statement on Monday. Malloy said Malvern would be opened on Tuesday to provide support to students and staff, and that the flags at all TDSB buildings would be lowered to half-mast “in Reese’s memory.” McMaster University president Patrick Deane said, “We are particularly saddened to learn that a young woman who was going to begin her studies at McMaster this fall was one of those who died in the attack.” Fallon was a member of the Beaches—East York Young Liberals. Her family declined to speak with reporters, but Beaches—East York Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith issued a brief statement on their behalf.  “The family is devastated (and) asks that their privacy be respected at this time,” it said. Erskine-Smith told the Star outside Fallon’s home that he knew her personally and she was “whip smart.” She “cared about making a difference in the world and this is a huge loss,” he said. Julie Steel, whose husband taught Fallon at Malvern, set up a   page on Monday to create an annual scholarship in her honour. The funds will go towards a graduate of Malvern CI who is entering a nursing program. Steel, a nurse herself, said Fallon, whom she described as “kind and caring,” would have been an “amazing nurse.”  “I could just see it in her … that was the career path for her,” Steel said in an interview. “Knowing that she’s not going to be able to do that has really broken our hearts.” Steel set up the GoFundMe campaign with an initial goal of $5,000. Within three hours, it had raised nearly $3,000. “Reese was just a wonderful, lovely girl,” Steel said. “For this to happen to her is just unthinkable. We just don’t even know how to process it.” News of Fallon’s death travelled quickly on social media Monday, as friends and family members took to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to share their messages of remembrance and grief.  “In absolute shock. Reese Fallon was such a great person and good friend,” Frank Hong, 16, wrote on Facebook. “She did not deserve to die this way.” In an interview, Hong, a fellow Young Liberal, said: “Reese just had a magnetic, bubbly, fun personality. She would always greet people with a big, fat hug. People would just want to be around her.” The last time Sarah Lomon, 14, saw Fallon was at the Pride parade in June. “She was literally an amazing person. She was smart, she was funny, she was beautiful, she had so many friends,” Lomon, who was friends with Fallon’s younger sister, told the Star. “She had a bright future. She got into a good university. It’s just really hard to believe that she passed away when she had so much going for her.” Witness Ali Demircan, who was sitting with friends on a bench near Logan and Danforth Aves. Sunday night, told the Star he saw an injured woman during a break in the shooting.  Demircan said the woman, who was holding her arm where she appeared to have been shot, approached him and asked him to call 911, but the shooting started again before he could do so. “When I turned back, there she was lying behind a small tree on Logan Ave. People were trying to help her and do CPR,” Demircan said. “It was terrible.” The surviving victims range in age from 17 to 59 years old, police said.  Three victims were taken to Sunnybrook hospital. Five were taken to St. Michael’s Hospital with injuries ranging from serious to critical. Three of the patients at St. Mike’s underwent “immediate, life-saving surgery,” said Dr. Najma Ahmed, acting head of the trauma surgical unit. Michael Garron Hospital, formerly known as Toronto East General, confirmed its staff treated seven people who were injured during the shooting. Five were released and two were in stable condition on Monday. “Our hearts are heavy today as we try to comprehend the tragic events,” Dr. Paul Hannam, chief of emergency medicine, told journalists assembled outside the hospital on Monday afternoon. “Many of our friends, patients and colleagues not only work in this neighbourhood, but live in this area and frequent the restaurants and local shops with their families … This is our home.” ",0,Danforth shooting victim Reese Fallon remembered as ‘whip smart’ student with a bright future
"Police have arrested and charged a man with first-degree murder in connection to the shooting death of a 30-year-old man who was attending a memorial near the Canadian National Exhibition.  On Sept. 2, police were called to Coronation Park, south of Lake Shore Blvd. W. and across from the Princes’ Gates, for reports of multiple gunshots in the area. They found Michael Lewis, 30, suffering from gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.  Lewis, of Markham, was attending a memorial for a man who had been a homicide victim nine years ago, Toronto Police Det. Amanda Thornton  . A memorial barbecue for Kamal Hercules, a 21-year-old man who had been  , was set to be held in the park that day. Thornton at the time said four men approached Lewis where he stood in the picnic area of the park. They had a short conversation before one of the men pulled out a handgun and shot Lewis several times at point-blank range, she said. There were around 30-40 people attending the memorial, Thornton said “They fled in all directions.” Andrew Douglas, 25, of Toronto, was arrested on Thursday with the assistance of the Gun and Gang Task Force. He is charged with first-degree murder.  Douglas was scheduled to appear in court at Old City Hall on Friday at 10 a.m.  ",0,Police charge man with murder over fatal shooting near CNE
"Some of Ontario’s  on mental health and addiction supports “will be going to the police,” Premier Doug Ford said after an impromptu city hall summit on fighting gun violence. Ford did not elaborate during an interview with CTV News Toronto on how much money will flow to police, what it will be spent on or how that could help prevent tragedies such as   in which a gunman killed a 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman, and injured 13 others. The family of 29-year-old Faisal Hussain, who died after his rampage,  he struggled with psychosis and “severe mental health challenges” his entire life. Ford — who met with Mayor John Tory, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders and Bill Blair, federal minister of border security and organized crime reduction — noted that Ottawa has also previously pledged to spend $1.9 billion on mental health. Experts say only a very small percentage of people who experience mental health issues act out violently, and the chance of being killed by a mentally ill stranger is exceedingly rare. When asked how he views the court system and gun crime, Ford said he’s “pretty biased when it comes to this.” “Our sentences aren’t tough enough for people with guns that commit violent gun acts,” Ford, who refused to speak to waiting reporters when he left the city hall meeting, later told CTV. “I think we have to toughen up the sentences and we can’t let these people out in a few years on parole and let it happen again. Or somebody gets arrested on a Friday night and they get bail and are back out on Wednesday for retribution. That’s absolutely unacceptable and I think there was a consensus in the (meeting) room on that and I think the laws have to be changed.” Tory spokesperson Don Peat said the mayor “is on record talking about the need for tougher gun laws and parole laws.” At the start of Monday’s city council meeting, the mayor said, “I promise all the people of Toronto, but most importantly those directly affected by this tragedy, that we will all be relentless in getting answers about why this senseless attack happened. “There are far too many people carrying around guns in our city and our region who should not have them.” As photographers snapped photos before the city hall meeting, Blair said, “We stand united — all three levels of government stand united behind our first responders and the city of Toronto ... to bring all the support and resource that is required to keep Toronto a great safe and livable city.” As he left Tory’s office, Blair called the meeting “excellent.” His communications aide did not respond to a request for the minister’s reaction to Ford’s comments. Monday’s council meeting was to start with debate over a recently proposed plan to curb gun violence after a spate of Toronto shootings. Instead, that debate was postponed until Tuesday as Tory and councillors for the east-end neighbourhood expressed their grief and sorrow. Tory acknowledged his lobbying of senior governments to take steps to stem the flow of guns to Toronto criminals won’t completely eliminate such shootings, but he vowed to keep up the pressure. Much of the city staff-proposed $44-million, five-year gun violence reduction plan, which proposes $30.3 million in spending on at-risk youth in priority neighbourhoods, is targeted at gang-related shootings and those involving young people. The plan won’t address the most pressing issues, such as mental health, that are said to be at play in this most recent violence, local councillors said Monday. “Last night when we got to the scene, we were told it was not gang-related violence but this lone-gunman violence, which is new and unique in this way to the city of Toronto and very troubling, very disturbing,” said Danforth-area Councillor Paula Fletcher. “I do think talking about guns is important.” She and Councillor Mary Fragedakis, who lives on and represents the stretch of the Danforth where the shooting took place, said more needs to be done to help people with “emotional issues.” “We’re failing as a society,” Fragedakis said. “People need help. They’re not getting the help that they need and they’re lashing out in a number of ways and this is one of them. And this has a lot of consequences, obviously, for other people who are collateral damage.” Approving the plan is up to council.

"There was merriment as well as melancholy at Taste of the Danforth, Canada’s biggest street festival, this weekend.  It’s odd that having a shish kebab in the heart of Toronto has become a political statement, but that was the point as festivalgoers paid tribute to the victims of last month’s  , while emphasizing the fact that life goes on.  “I really felt just personally that I had to pay tribute, especially to the two young girls who died,” said Tina Cyr, 42. Cyr and Alex Stratakos were sitting in front of a makeshift memorial on Saturday while a band played Greek music behind them. A cardboard sign read: “Reese Fallon died in this space 3 weeks ago. And four others were shot. Lest we forget.” Earlier, Cyr had stopped by St. Barnabas Anglican Church to light a candle for the victims and make a donation. Outside the church, organizers had created a memorial for the victims where flowers, candles and stuffed animals overflowed on the sidewalk. A   on Saturday night, headlined by Canadian rock band Billy Talent, raised thousands of dollars for the #TorontoStrong fund in support of shooting victims.  Cyr said this year has been especially tough in the city where she was raised. The April   in North York that killed 10 people and injured 16 happened on her birthday. Two people were killed and 13 injured in the Danforth shooting on July 23. “I don’t know what’s happening. But I do know nothing’s going to stop us,” said Cyr, showing off the colourful henna tattoo on her foot that she had painted on minutes earlier. It wasn’t lost on some festivalgoers that the Friday opening of the festival coincided with a   that left four people dead, including two police officers. Mass shootings, once thought to be a mostly American phenomenon, are hitting closer to home. But the crowds on the Danforth Saturday suggested that there was less fear and more stoicism. Organizers didn’t know what to expect, but based on preliminary numbers, they now say it looks to be a record year. “The help we got from everybody was incredible,” said Constantine Voidonicolas, chair of the Greek Town on the Danforth Business Improvement Area. “The prime minister was here twice. The mayor was here every day. People are saying they are not going to lock themselves up. It makes us feel that people are thinking of us.” Voidonicolas was sitting in an elevated hospitality tent parked outside a Greek Orthodox Church in the middle of the Danforth. He said he was in a restaurant having coffee with friends the night of the shooting. He thought the shots were firecrackers. “It was so shocking,” he said. “I didn’t know what was happening.” From a humble festival with a turnout of about 5,000 a quarter-century ago, the Taste of the Danforth has become a major street festival with an estimated attendance of 1.6 million and economic impact of $106 million over three days, according to organizers. Key to that success has been moving from a strictly Greek-oriented festival to a much more multicultural celebration. Sharing the stage with Greek performers are Bollywood dancers and an Asian beauty contest. Samosas and ramen are offered alongside traditional Greek fare. “If you ask me why we’re successful after 25 years, it’s because we’ve changed as the city has changed,” said festival organizer and spokesperson Howard Lichtman. “We’re a multicultural festival with a dollop of tzatziki.” The mainstreaming of the festival can also be seen in the corporate booths, from Ford to Costco. The festival attracts many visitors beyond Greektown, with 38 per cent coming from at least 40 kilometres away. Those would include Orillia natives Cheryl McIntyre and her granddaughter Hallie Hibbs. “Being a young person myself, it is kind of scary. Especially when you hear about the mass shootings in schools in the United States,” said Hibbs, 17. “So many young people are dying that it really astonishes me that humans can do this to each other. I grew up in the country, so I don’t believe in guns unless you’re using it to feed your family. There should be no other purpose.” Outside St. Barnabas Church, a couple of blocks from where Hibbs and McIntyre had been sitting, three young women were selling T-shirts that read #DanforthStrong #TorontoStrong with the word “Together” underneath. The shirts were selling for a minimum $20 donation and buttons were $5, with proceeds going to the victims. Volunteer Malak, who wanted only her first name to be published, said on Friday one festivalgoer handed her $500. “I was just so shaken. It was really generous,” she said. “And he didn’t even take a T-shirt. People really continue to astonish. They have been so supportive and kind.” ",0,‘Nothing’s going to stop us’: Taste of the Danforth festival a mix of celebration and remembrance

Ten-year-old Julianna Kozis was also killed and 13 others injured in the attack. The shooter, identified as Faisal Hussain, 29, died of what police sources said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound following an exchange of fire with police.  The obituary notes Fallon had recently graduated from high school and was set to study nursing at Hamilton’s McMaster University in the fall. It says she loved her co-workers at Loblaws and adored her friends in the Young Liberals “who embraced and loved the strong and sassy girl she was.” “We wish our sweet angel eternal peace and light,” the obituary reads. “We will never forget you for one moment, and we will always carry you in our hearts.” It also says: “Reese will be deeply missed by her big sister Riley and her little sister Quinn. “She will be deeply missed but not forgotten by all of her close honorary family members, cousins, extended family and of course all of her close and beautiful friends,” the obituary says. A public visitation will be held for Fallon on Sunday in Scarborough, followed by a funeral service on Monday. ",0,Danforth shooting victim Reese Fallon’s family says she won’t be forgotten
"Frantically reading about Sunday’s  , I was too engrossed, too  , to realize one of my daughters was standing behind me. This is what happens when horror casts a shadow in your backyard: you lose your bearings, your sense of time and place. You get lost in a labyrinth of  .  How unnerving it is to see your neighbourhood in the news behind crime tape. But before I turned around on Monday morning, before I could fold down my laptop screen and shield her from the real world, Charlotte had skimmed enough to know something terrible had unfolded in the middle of her little world of souvlaki restaurants and toy boutiques and ice cream parlours and rock stores. “Someone was shooting people on the Danforth?” she asked, her face contorting with primal fear. “Someone  people on the Danforth?” Her twin sister, Ava, was now present for a sombre conversation no parent wants to have and every parent is having far too frequently this summer in a city besieged by inexplicable violence.  How do I explain why a man might climb into a van and start mowing down pedestrians on Yonge St.? How do I field queries from my kids about serial killers or brazen executions in the Entertainment District or the unsolved murders of a billionaire couple who lived not far from where their grandparents live? Earlier this summer, there was a knock on my front door. It was two detectives who asked if they could search my side yard. There had been reports of gunshots in the area near Pape and, following eyewitness leads, it seems the shooter may have tossed his weapon somewhere along the path my girls ride their scooters. “Shouldn’t we move?” Ava asked me on Monday morning, in a tone so matter-of-fact it made me wince. “Move?” I repeated, slowly and loudly, offering comfort by pretending her question was ridiculous. “No, no, no. Toronto is a very safe place to live! Don’t worry!” They looked at me with as much skepticism as two 11-year-olds can muster. As they got ready for summer school, practicing ballet twirls and swapping plans for an upcoming field trip to a farmers’ market — “I’m going to buy honey sticks” — I couldn’t stop thinking about that girl, one year younger than my daughters, who was shot and killed on Sunday night while out with her loved ones on a street in which the threat of random crime used to be set at zero. My heart breaks for that innocent child. My heart breaks for her anguished family. And my heart breaks for what is now happening to this city, a disorienting array of deadly incidents that seem to be unfolding across the GTA in slow-mo, freezing block after block with the same creeping sense of dread. The Danforth was a place where the only smoke came from cast iron trays of extinguished Saganaki on patios filled with boisterous diners shouting, “ ” The Danforth was where the only presence of law enforcement came by way of the parking patrol. The Danforth is where the biggest intrusion on any given night was a panhandler outside the LCBO or a sweet guy selling roses to any tables of two occupied by apparent romantic couples.  From early morning coffee runs to long after the moon danced off the shoulders of half-soused revelers who had spilled out of bars, the Danforth felt cloistered, benign and immune to human savagery at its most depraved.  The Danforth is where a mass shooting could   happen. But here we are. It has happened. As I type this dispatch, the news choppers are rumbling in the skies above me and the nearby streets remain closed as detectives try to piece together Sunday night’s horrifying sequence of events that left two of our fellow citizens dead and sent 13 others to hospital, some with critical injuries. When that gunman opened fire so coldly and methodically, when chaos descended and 911 lit up with desperate calls, another stretch of this rambling town felt violated in a way that’s becoming so common it’s terrifying. This was Toronto the Good, once again, reimagined as Toronto the Bad. This was Toronto cast into a previously unknown role. As an adult, it never hurts to keep perspective, even when the viewpoint bends toward the horrifying. But as a Torontonian — and as a parent — I’m increasingly struggling to see this city as anything but a metropolis at the edge of an abyss. Where are these guns coming from? How do we make them go away again? When I see my kids later today, I will repeat my mantra: Toronto is a very safe city. Do not worry. Everything will be fine. I will hug them and tell them comforting lies. But the truth is, we should all be worried. Something terrible is happening to our city.

"Crowds of tearful mourners gathered to remember Reese Fallon at a public visitation on Sunday, a week after she was killed in a shooting rampage in Toronto’s bustling Greektown neighbourhood. People lined up quietly inside the east Toronto funeral home, tissues in hand, to grieve the 18-year-old who died when a gunman opened fire on pedestrians and restaurant-goers on a busy Danforth Avenue last Sunday. Ten-year-old Julianna Kozis was also killed, and 13 others were injured — some critically. The gunman was found dead of a gunshot wound nearby after exchanging fire with police. Two concurrent investigations into the incident — one by Toronto police and the other by the province’s police watchdog — are ongoing. At the visitation on Sunday, Fallon was remembered for her life rather than her death. A yearbook and other high school memorabilia lay on a table inside the funeral home, next to a T-shirt for Hamilton’s McMaster University, where she was set to begin studying nursing in the fall. Photos of Fallon as a child and as a teen lined the hallway leading into the visitation room. The quote “I think everybody should like everybody,” attributed to Andy Warhol, was printed on the back of memorial cards handed out to those in attendance. Matthew Smith, a friend and classmate of Fallon’s who came to the visitation, said he last texted her three days before she was killed. “The fact that she’s not here now and the fact I can’t talk to her now, it’s just devastating,” he said. Smith spent more than an hour inside the funeral home on Sunday, and said the crowds that have shown up to see her indicate how important she was to many people. “I feel like her legacy is so important to people right now,” he said. “She was kind ... She loved to make new friends. You can tell by looking at her picture.” Smith said he knew Fallon because they both worked on student council together at Malvern Collegiate. She was a year older than him and encouraged him to participate in extra-curriculars. Among the people attending Sunday’s visitation were Toronto Mayor John Tory and former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne. A funeral, which will also be open to the public, is scheduled for Monday morning. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is among those expected to attend.

"Shortly after 10 p.m. last Sunday July 22, Inori Roy, a reporter in the Star’s  , noticed a trickle of posts on Twitter about unconfirmed reports of  .  Within a few minutes, the trickle became a deluge. To find out more, she immediately called police, EMS and Toronto Fire Services, which told her they had received the first call at 10:04 p.m. “The gravity of the situation really dawned on me when I heard the urgency in the voice of the paramedic I spoke to. He sounded like he was on the verge of panic, like there was as crisis,” said Roy. She ran over to the Star’s digital desk to alert editors, who instructed her to start writing a short story to be posted on thestar.com. At the same time, Star photographer Richard Lautens had just returned to his home near the Danforth after a vacation in cottage country, when his two kids, who had gone out for dinner, came running in. They had just seen a string of police cars, sirens blaring, speeding down the Danforth. Lautens grabbed his camera and started running. A few minutes later, at around 10:10 p.m., he was at Alexander the Great Parkette at the corner of Logan and Danforth Aves., where he saw paramedics administering first aid to two people lying on the ground. “It was just mayhem everywhere,” said Lautens. “Nobody knew what was going on.” He snapped pictures of bystanders looking on in shock, of police interviewing witnesses and of paramedics loading victims on gurneys into ambulances. Using his phone as an internet hotspot, he quickly emailed the newsroom a couple of photos that could run with the initial story, which went online at 10:51 p.m. It reported that a man dressed in black had opened fire on the Danforth, injuring multiple people. As the scale of the tragedy started to become clear, news editor Jason Paul, who was overseeing production at the Star that night, began making a plan to get reporters on the ground. “As more eyewitness accounts came in, we wanted to be sensitive knowing that lives had been lost and others injured. We wanted to help readers understand what was happening but at the same time knowing this was a devastating situation for so many people,” said Paul.  He called breaking news editor Amit Shilton to discuss the unfolding situation. Shilton then started calling reporters who lived in the area of the shooting to see who could get to the scene and interview witnesses. One of those reporters was David Rider, the Star’s city hall bureau chief, who was out walking his dog when he started hearing sirens and saw a police command vehicle heading north on Carlaw Ave. towards the Danforth. Shortly before midnight, Rider stationed himself outside the police cordon at that intersection and started interviewing people leaving the scene.  Shilton also reached Wendy Gillis, the Star’s crime reporter, who hopped in a cab and rushed to the other end of the cordon at Danforth and Broadview Ave. where she interviewed several witnesses. One of the first people she stopped on the street was an employee of the Second Cup near Chester subway station that had been a target of the gunman. The employee provided a detailed description of the shooter and recounted a shocking story of watching him fire his gun at the shop. Back in the newsroom, digital producers Tanis Fowler and Priya Ramanujam kept the online news file updated throughout the night and started a liveblog which pulled in tweets from reporters on the scene and Roy in the radio room. Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Gillis learned — thanks to a timely text message from a colleague — that Police Chief Mark Saunders and Mayor John Tory would be holding a press conference in just a few minutes at Danforth and Logan Aves. Gillis was about a kilometre away so she sprinted as fast as she could, arriving just as the chief and the mayor stepped up to the microphones. Jenna Moon, the overnight radio room reporter, was also dispatched to the scene to gather colour and interview witnesses. She later met up with Gillis before heading to St. Michael’s Hospital to check on the status of victims.  Columnist Rosie DiManno also went to the scene and spoke to witnesses for  she filed early that morning. Sunday night’s front-page editor, Anthony Collins, stayed all night to combine the individual journalists’ reports into a   covering as many aspects of the shooting as possible. “At that point we were really leaning on the reporters to give us whatever kind of colour they could from the scene in order to take the story beyond a shorter police file, to really flesh out what happened,” said Paul, who also stayed at the Star throughout the night. “The goal was to set up a really great package — Rosie’s column and a thorough news story — that was available for readers in the morning.”  ",0,How the Star covered the Danforth shooting
"A cyclist who died last week in hospital after he was hit by a car on Lake Shore Blvd. last month “created so much kindness,” friends and family told the Star. Jonas Mitchell, 36, was the third of four cyclists to die on Toronto streets this year. On May 15, Mitchell was riding his bicycle on Colborne Lodge Dr., heading south towards Lake Shore Blvd. At the same time, police say a 27-year-old man was driving east on Lake Shore in a Honda Civic, approaching Colborne.  They collided. Mitchell was taken to hospital, where he died on June 7, police said.  Family and friends identified him to the Star.  Cody Campbell, Mitchell’s younger brother, said that he’ll be remembered as someone who was always there to lend a hand, an avid traveller and a Dallas Cowboys fan. “He was there, whether it was something small or something big,” said Campbell. “And he was always positive, even in the worst situations he’d be the guy that would find something to be positive about.” Campbell visited his brother in hospital and said they had been optimistic he would pull through. “(He was) someone who’s created so much kindness, compassion and happiness and has been taken away from so many different people. Whether it’s family or friends, everyone that knows him knows him as that guy who is going to make the gathering that much better, and we’ve lost that — we don’t have that because it was taken away from us.” Robert McEvoy said Mitchell and he had been best friends since they met at school in Grade 1. “We grew up together,” McEvoy said. “He was the best man and emcee at my wedding because he was always the life of the party and the centre of attraction.” McEvoy said he was lucky enough to see Mitchell in Toronto in April, shortly before the accident, when he and his son came down from Ottawa to visit. He described Mitchell as a very outgoing person with a huge heart. “He was the type of person to make friends with the world,” McEvoy said. “From the person who worked at the hotel, to strangers walking on the street.” McEvoy said Mitchell was his daughter’s godfather, and he would often come over to hang out with her, or take her out for sushi and go “girl shopping.” Mitchell used to work at two popular Toronto restaurants, Jump and Canoe, both owned by Oliver & Bonacini Hospitality (O&B). “All of us at O&B are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Jonas Mitchell, and our hearts go out to his family,” the company said in a statement. “A valued member of the teams at both Canoe and Jump restaurants, Jonas’ personal energy and positive spirit have left a lasting impact.” Mitchell’s co-workers at O&B   while he was in hospital. As of late Wednesday night, $34,341 of the $50,000 goal had been raised by 340 people in 27 days. Campbell said the support after his brother’s accident was “very overwhelming.” He hopes Mitchell’s death raises awareness about road safety in Toronto. Jennifer Keesmaat, Toronto’s former chief planner, said Wednesday   after a surge of pedestrian and cyclist deaths this week. Mitchell’s cousin, Jeremy MacDonald, informed the Star of a memorial ghost bike ride planned for Friday in Mitchell’s honour. It’s a 10-kilometre route starting at Spadina Ave. and Bloor St. and ending at the crash site on the south side of Lake Shore Blvd. W. at Colborne Lodge Rd., said the public Facebook  . MacDonald also commented on the rising number of cyclist and pedestrian deaths happening across the city. “There is clearly a crisis in this city,” he said in a Facebook message. “Pedestrian deaths and cyclist deaths continue to rise astronomically.” “There is an utter failure in transportation … and this is true for pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and drivers,” he said. By the Star’s count, 18 pedestrians and four cyclists have been killed this year already. Campbell’s glad the issue is in the spotlight, but it comes at a bitter cost. “I don’t think it should take a situation like this to be having this conversation,” he said. “This whole situation has really opened my own eyes to the attitudes of both motorists and cyclists — I think there needs to be mutual respect.” Traffic death numbers compiled by the Star are higher than the official police count. That’s in part because Toronto police figures for traffic fatalities don’t include deadly collisions that happen on private property, such as in the parking lots of apartment buildings or malls, or on provincial 400-series highways within Toronto, which are the jurisdiction of the Ontario Provincial Police. The Star has counted four cyclist deaths this year; police have counted three,  . Neither tally includes victims of homicide, such as those killed in the Yonge St. van rampage. Police announced Mitchell’s death amid a wave of outrage over pedestrian and cyclist deaths in the city.

"The man who unleashed bullets on a busy Danforth stretch Sunday night was suffering from “severe mental health challenges” and struggling with psychosis and depression, his devastated family said Monday.  Just after 10 p.m. Sunday, a lone gunman dressed in dark clothing and a black baseball cap fired upon groups of people as they were enjoying a warm summer night out in Toronto’s Greektown neighbourhood — killing a 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman, and injuring 13 others.  The gunman, identified Monday as Faisal Hussain, 29, then died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police sources.  “We are at a terrible loss for words but we must speak out to express our deepest condolences to the families who are now suffering on account of our son’s horrific actions,” Hussain’s family wrote in a statement Monday. “We are utterly devastated by the incomprehensible news that our son was responsible for the senseless violence and loss of life that took place on the Danforth.” Twin investigations are now underway to determine key details in a shooting that has left the city grieving, shocking the residents in the vibrant Greektown neighbourhood where police descended Monday to collect evidence and photograph bullet casings.  Chief among the questions now are  , and how he got a hold of a handgun — particularly in light of his family’s claims he suffered from psychosis. The family’s statement said the interventions of professionals were unsuccessful in helping him, and medications and therapy “were unable to treat him.” “While we did our best to seek help for him throughout his life of struggle and pain, we could never imagine that this would be his devastating and destructive end,” the statement read. Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said at a news conference at police headquarters that the investigation was “very fluid, it is very new.” “We do not know why this has happened yet,” he said. “It’s going to take some time.” While Toronto police are probing the actions of the shooter, Ontario’s police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), is examining Hussain’s death. Officials with the SIU confirmed Hussain died following an exchange of gunfire with two Toronto police officers on Bowden St. He then fled the area, but was found dead on Danforth Ave. While the SIU has not provided any details, police sources tell the Star Hussain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  The two officers involved in the shootout were “visibly shaken” by the encounter, said Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack. The alleyway where the exchange of gunfire took place remained cordoned off by yellow tape Monday, a police cruiser towed from the scene earlier in the day leaving broken glass in its wake.  Police are now digging into the suspected shooter’s background, and have gotten a warrant to search a unit in a residence on Thorncliffe Park Dr. On Monday evening, two Toronto police officers sat outside the door to a mid-level apartment unit, while a security guard watched the front entrance.  Prior to Sunday’s shooting, the Hussain family had already suffered tragedy, residents of the building said.  Khalid Malik said Hussain had a sister who died several years ago in an accident, and has a brother who has been in a coma in hospital for the last year.  Mirza Baig, a long-time resident of the building, said Hussain’s father was also sick and possibly suffering from Parkinson’s.  Malik described Hussain as a quiet man he would sometimes run into on the street. The two would shake hands and Hussain would give him a cigarette but never said much. “Unbelievable,” Malik kept repeating Monday evening, speaking to reporters. Of the 15 victims shot in the rampage, eight were female. The surviving thirteen victims range in age from 17 to 59 years old, and remain in hospital with injuries ranging from minor to critical. In a news release Monday evening, Toronto police identified the killed woman as Reese Fallon, 18, who lived in Toronto’s Beach neighbourhood. A spokesperson for the devastated family said the family had requested privacy, adding he personally knew her to be as caring and “whip smart.” Fallon’s younger sister posted  . “Today has been the hardest because I haven’t just lost a sister I’ve lost my lifelong best-friend and anyone who knew us knew that when we were together we were inseparable,” she wrote.  “I am crushed and broken and there won’t be one minute that goes by for the rest of my life that I won’t think of you.” Police did not identify the 10-year-old girl who was killed, saying her family did not want her name released. Witness Ali Demircan, who was sitting with friends on a bench near Logan and Danforth Aves. Sunday night, told the Star he saw an injured woman during a break in the shooting.  Demircan said the woman, who was holding her arm where she appeared to have been shot, approached him and asked him to call 911, but the shooting started again before he could do so. “When I turned back there she was lying behind a small tree on Logan avenue. People were trying to help her and do CPR,” Demircan said.  “It was terrible.” Neither police nor the SIU would speculate on a motive for the shooting. “He received a gunshot wound, but I’m not going to expand on that,” Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said at the Monday news conference.  After Hussain was identified, the National Council of Canadian Muslims released a statement condemning the shooting attack.  “Like all Canadians, we grieve the loss of our fellow community members and our thoughts and prayers are with the survivors, the families and friends of the victims, and all Torontonians during this absolutely heartbreaking time,” NCCM Executive Director Ihsaan Gardee said in the statement. The gunman was randomly shooting like someone “in a video game,” witness Lenny Graf told the Star. “He was very relaxed, it was pretty disturbing,” said Graf, who was with his family having dinner at Christina’s Restaurant when his kids asked to go play at the fountain in the Alexander the Great parkette on Logan Ave. When Graf got outside, he heard loud popping sounds. “I thought it was firecrackers, except that people started to run away, and crouch down and scream,” he said. The gunman, who was dressed in all black, was on the sidewalk on the north side of Danforth, near the fountain, Graf said. “I saw him finish shooting some people and then walk away,” Graf said. Graf said he remembers seeing someone on the ground, then seeing paramedics and police arrive. “I always thought if I was up against a guy shooting people, I would run up and grab the gun or something, but there was no way to do that,” he said. Androo Leipurts was bartending at Brass Taps pub when he heard a loud commotion and looked out the window to see people running. He saw a woman running, then fall to the ground. “I essentially saw someone’s daughter drop to the ground and roll,” he said. Mayor John Tory, who headed to the shooting scene Sunday night, offered his condolences to families of the victims and urged residents not to jump to conclusions about what transpired and why. In a statement, Tory called the shooting a “despicable act.” “On behalf of all Toronto residents, I am outraged that someone has unleashed such a terrible attack on our city and people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening,” Tory said. “ ... While our city will always be resilient in the face of such attacks, it does not mean such a cowardly act committed against our residents is any less painful — this is an attack against innocent families and our entire city.” Danforth Ave. was closed between Broadview and Pape Aves. until shortly after 5:30 p.m.  The normally vibrant strip of the Danforth was eerily quiet in the morning, hours after the shooting. There were no parents walking their children to day camp, no businesses open and no one was grabbing pastries from the local coffee shops. No one was allowed inside except for a few business owners escorted by police to grab belongings. All morning, residents stopped, stared, shook their heads and muttered words like “unbelievable” and “isn’t this crazy?” At 7 p.m. Monday, people streamed into Calvary Church, just north of Danforth Ave. for a prayer vigil that was closed to media. Some carried flowers, others hugged and fought back tears. “We love the Danforth and were so sad this happened here,” said Nancy Kruger, who said she lived in the neighbourhood when she was younger and had returned to support local businesses. “We are not afraid to come back here,” she said. Shiraz Mohamed, an Imam at nearby Madinah mosque walked with a group of about 20 others from the mosque to the vigil. “We are part of this community and we are affected like anybody else so we wanted to show our support,” he said on his way there. Three patients were taken to Sunnybrook hospital late Sunday. Five were taken to St. Michael’s Hospital with injuries ranging from serious to critical. Three of the patients at St. Mike’s underwent “immediate, life-saving surgery.” Michael Garron hospital, formerly the Toronto East General Hospital, treated two gunshot victims, who are in stable condition. The hospital also treated five others who were hurt, but they have since been released.

"They’re a beloved symbol of Toronto and have been a mainstay of the city’s public transportation network for a century, but streetcars may pose a higher risk to pedestrian and cyclist safety compared to other transit vehicles. According to a Star analysis of data posted online by the Toronto police, streetcars account for a disproportionate number of TTC-involved collisions that kill bicycle riders or people on foot.  Between 2007 and 2017, TTC buses and streetcars were involved in at least 29 crashes that resulted in the deaths of so-called “vulnerable road users.”  Of those collisions, 15 — or slightly more than half — involved streetcars, despite the fact that they make up only about one tenth of the TTC’s fleet of more than 2,000 vehicles, and the agency travels about 10 times as many kilometres using buses than it does streetcars.  Deaths involving streetcars still make up only a fraction of the number of vulnerable road users killed in Toronto, which have averaged around 30 a year over the past decade.  The TTC says streetcars remain “an extremely safe mode of transport” and the vehicles regularly travel millions of kilometres without a fatality. But there are some factors that might contribute to them being involved in a higher number of deadly collisions than buses, said spokesperson Stuart Green. “Streetcars are heavy, don’t stop quickly and can’t swerve to avoid people,” Green said in an email. “Despite the training and best efforts of our operators to be defensive at all times, sadly, collisions do occur.”  The 15 streetcar-related fatalities involved 12 pedestrians and three cyclists. The statistics don’t indicate who was at fault for the bus and streetcar crashes. In some cases, non-TTC vehicles were also involved.  Green noted pedestrians often use streetcar rights-of-way — the streetcar-only lanes that separate transit vehicles from car traffic on routes like Spadina Ave. and St. Clair Ave. — to cross midblock, which can be dangerous.  Nine of the 15 streetcar-related deaths, including two of the cyclist crashes, occurred on routes with rights-of-way.  “The TTC is looking at how it might mark the curbs of rights-of-way to clearly delineate that they are not islands of refuge and pose a danger,” Green said.  The agency also recently launched a public information campaign to alert people that streetcars can’t stop quickly. Messages posted on the vehicles warn they weigh 48,200 kg and take time to come to a halt.  In addition to fatal crashes, TTC data shows streetcars are more likely than buses to be in collisions of any kind, including with other vehicles. Last year streetcars experienced 7.61 collisions per 100,000 miles driven, more than double the rate for buses. There’s no clear explanation for why streetcars would be involved in a disproportionate number of collisions that kill vulnerable road users.  Dylan Reid, the co-founder of pedestrian advocacy group Walk Toronto, said his organization has no position on whether streetcars are a particular safety concern. But he suggested one reason for the high number of streetcar-pedestrian fatalities could be that the vehicles mainly run downtown. “Streetcars operate in the areas with the largest pedestrian volumes. So you know, streetcars are interacting with pedestrians disproportionately compared to buses,” he said.  That may not fully explain the phenomenon, however. The TTC also runs buses on busy downtown routes like Bay, Ossington, and Wellesley Sts., yet there was only one bus fatality downtown between 2007 and 2017.  Councillor Joe Mihevc represents a ward that includes St. Clair Ave., a streetcar route on which  . That was the same year the city completed the streetcar right-of-way on St. Clair.  Despite the pedestrian deaths caused by streetcars, Mihevc argues that the right-of-way has actually made the road safer. He points to preliminary results of a study conducted by the TTC that determined collisions between all types of road users on St. Clair dropped by 28 per cent after the right-of-way was installed.  “The argument is not against streetcars, but it’s against streetcars in mixed traffic,” said Mihevc (Ward 21 St. Paul’s).  Gil Penalosa, founder of 8-80 Cities, a non-profit that advocates for sustainable mobility options, said streetcars aren’t inherently unsafe. But he suggested the TTC could make modifications to reduce collisions.  “I do think there is clearly a problem of design,” he said, arguing that railings should be erected on rights-of-way to guide streetcar passengers toward safe intersections, rather than allowing them to cross midblock.  “How could we invest so much money on the streetcar (system), but not make those small changes?” he asked.  Last year, there were three vulnerable road user fatalities involving TTC vehicles, which represented a reversal of progress the transit agency made in 2016 when no cyclists or pedestrians were killed.  The TTC has attributed the  , which revamped training and operating protocols in order to prevent crashes. “We’re constantly reviewing statistics, detecting areas of concern, investigating incidents and adjusting our practices where necessary to improve safety,” said Green. Amid growing concern about traffic deaths, two years ago council endorsed a   that set a goal of eliminating fatalities and serious injuries. The TTC is taking part in the plan.

"A surge in  is triggering demands that Mayor John Tory, city council and the Ontario government act now to stop the carnage. “I am calling for a state of emergency, which means treating this crisis as a high priority and investing in immediate measures to create a safe environment for vulnerable road users,” Jennifer Keesmaat, Toronto’s former chief planner, now a University of Toronto lecturer, told the Star Wednesday. “The SARS crisis took 44 lives in Canada. Ninety-three pedestrians or cyclists have died on the streets of Toronto since  was implemented two years ago. The time for half-measures is over — and the half measures are not working, anyway.” Jessica Spieker, who suffered a broken spine and brain injury when a car hit her bike in 2015, said council is “horribly failing” implementing Vision Zero — a plan to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2021 — when more, not fewer, people are dying. “The impact is literally life and death — people are dying horribly violent, bloody brutal deaths unnecessarily because it seems we lack the political will to implement solutions,’ said Spieker, a member of advocacy group  . “It’s pretty clear we have leadership that doesn’t really mind sacrificing pedestrian and cyclist lives to make sure our streets are convenient for people who drive cars.” Richard Florida, a renowned University of Toronto cities expert who immigrated from the U.S. a decade ago, called efforts by Tory, his council allies and the provincial government to protect vulnerable road users “shockingly neglectful.” “The way in which Americans discount gun deaths, Torontonians and their leaders seem to discount car-related deaths — like there’s nothing we can do about it,” he said.  By the   there were 41 pedestrian deaths in 2017, and 18 so far this year.  Toronto police traffic fatality figures are lower because they do not include those on private property or 400-series highways in Toronto, which are the jurisdiction of the Ontario Provincial Police. The official police tally for 2017 was 36, and the force says 17 pedestrians have died in 2018.  For the same reason, the Star’s count of cyclist deaths is also higher than Toronto police figures. The Star has counted four cyclist deaths this year, police have counted three,  . Neither tally includes victims of homicide, such as those killed in the Yonge St. van rampage.  A 58-year-old woman was killed Tuesday while riding in a protected Bloor St. bike lane when   at Bloor St., W. and St. George St. Officers on Tuesday also announced   on Lake Shore Boul. W. died from his injuries last week. And police have asked the public for help finding a who killed a female pedestrian at Briar Hill Ave. and Dufferin St. on Monday at 3 p.m.  For the day’s top news from the Star’s award-winning journalists,  Tory and his public works chair Coun. Jaye Robinson are touting steps including new bike lanes and establishing “ ” around all elementary schools, which double fines and open the door to photo radar in those zones, if Ontario’s new Progressive Conservative government gives approval. Critics want immediate changes including speed limits dropped to 30 km-h across Toronto, tougher penalties for killer motorists, more and better protected bike lanes, roads redesigned to slow rather than speed traffic, and more, better marked pedestrian crossings. After an unrelated news conference Wednesday, Tory said he is losing sleep over the deaths.  “Of all the things that gives me sleepless nights and has me needing us to do more is people dying on the streets,” he said, noting that some changes, such as reconfiguring roads, take time, but others can and are being be done now, including “watch your speed” signs in school zones and photo radar. “Frankly, quite a few of them wouldn’t be happening if I hadn’t taken the leadership to ask the province to change laws to allow us to do these things,” Tory said, adding others need to take responsibility, too. “Cyclists have to take more care too as do pedestrians, but the principle onus for change must rest on drivers ... to change their own behaviour.”  A Tory tweet that his thoughts are with the Bloor St. cyclist and her family was met with online scorn, with some noting the mayor fought the temporarily shelved “Transform Yonge” plan to reduce vehicle lanes on north Yonge St. and install protected bike lanes. Tory and his council allies rejected reducing space for cars, arguing the bike lanes should go on a side street. Coun. Joe Cressy said he and colleague Mike Layton are working on short-term and permanent changes to make the Bloor St. protected bike lanes safer. He said council has focused on “easy fixes” when it could have been redesigning streets to make people move safely, not quicker. The recently defeated Ontario Liberal government has also been scolded for lack of action. It passed the  last year to allow cities to use measures like photo radar within safety zones but failed to fully enact it. To automatically increase penalties against drivers that injure or kill pedestrians or cyclists, road safety advocates for years have pushed the province to adopt the Protecting Vulnerable Road Users Act. They have yet to be successful.  “The province snubs its nose at the request,” said Patrick Brown, lawyer and advocate behind the charge.  Re-elected NDP MPP Catherine Fife reintroduced the bill in April, and said it is one of the first items she will move forward when the Legislature is recalled.  “Every MPP should understand we’re at a crisis in terms of cycling and pedestrian safety,” she said. Safety advocates expressed fear the new PC government will do nothing to protect pedestrians and cyclists, or obstruct Toronto efforts to do so, given party leader Doug Ford’s past statements about such measures being a “war on the car.” Jeff Silverstein, a Ford spokesman, said Wednesday: “Our focus right now is on transition but moving forward we will take a close look at this and review all options that would make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.  The carnage in the GTA, wasn’t restricted to Toronto. A 47-year-old cyclist was  by a vehicle in Markham on Tuesday afternoon. *** The Star asked experts and activists what should be done to reduce pedestrian and cyclist deaths. - Declare all streets in Toronto community safety zones, lower speed limits and double penalties - Pass the Protecting Vulnerable Road Users Act - Restrict vehicles in highly dense areas based on weight and size - Reduce speed limits to 30 km-h on most city streets and enforce them. Why do we still have 40 km-h zones around schools? Cars should be crawling in these areas — children should be the priority.  - For pedestrians, aggressive “zebra” striping at every intersection across the city. Paint establishes a clear crossing point and visually disrupts the roadway, so that it does “feel” like a highway. - Enact comprehensive, safe bike networks like those created in Vancouver, New York City and Montreal. We have been too hesitant and incremental in our approach.  - Reduce speed limits on city streets dramatically. - Put cameras everywhere to target egregious speeding. “I’m willing to give up my privacy to catch speeders.” Reducing speed dramatically increases the chances of a struck person surviving. - More and better protected bike lanes. - Lower speed limits, “the mere act of posting a lower speed limit will lead to a reduction in road violence.” - Design out the conflict on roads with protective infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.

"PHOENIX—A political ad from   that shows a Mexican immigrant bragging about killing police officers has put the spotlight back on noted immigration hard-liner Joe Arpaio, who detained and released the man in the video years ago. The former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix says he’s being unfairly blamed for releasing the immigrant depicted in the video that has stoked immigration anxieties in the days leading up to the midterm elections. The ad centres on Luis Bracamontes, who was convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting deaths of two sheriff’s deputies in California while he was in the United States illegally. Trump blames Democrats for weak laws that allowed the man to keep coming across the border, even though he was deported during the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Bracamontes was also incarcerated four times in jails run by Arpaio, a Republican who is known for his crackdowns on illegal immigration and being the first person to receive a pardon from Trump. He campaigned for Trump on several occasions during the presidential campaign but lost his bid for a seventh term in 2016 amid a swirl of legal troubles. Arpaio said Friday that he hasn’t seen the ad and didn’t remember the details of the cases. But he said his jail officers likely acted properly by contacting federal immigration authorities to pick up Bracamontes, because that was the procedure in the jails at the time when inmates completed their sentences. He pinned the blame on federal immigration authorities for dropping the ball. “I would never release an illegal,” Arpaio said. “I think my reputation has shown show that for many, many, many years.” Bracamontes used several aliases, making it hard to pinpoint his immigration record. California authorities say Bracamontes was deported four times before he killed Sacramento County sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County sheriff’s Detective Michael Davis Jr. Bracamontes was deported at least once after doing time in Arpaio’s jails in drug cases from 1996 through 2001, according to court records in Arizona. Arpaio said at that time, his office had a system of notifying federal authorities about immigrants in the jail through a teletype system. Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the ad, which links Bracamontes’ crimes to a caravan of Central American migrants moving through Mexico, as a racist campaign tactic. Bracamontes was deported in 1997, when Clinton was in office, according to court records in Arizona. He was arrested for marijuana possession in March 2001 during Bush’s administration. It’s unclear when he returned to the United States illegally before that arrest. Comparisons have been drawn between the ad and the infamous “Willie Horton” commercial in the 1988 presidential race about a black man who raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. A news release issued by Arpaio’s office in the days after the attack on the California officers is murky on saying whether his office or federal immigration authorities had released Bracamontes onto the streets. Arpaio said he’s being unfairly blamed for releasing an immigrant back into the community who nearly 13 years later would kill police officers. He said his jail officers did as much as they could over the years to notify federal authorities when thousands of immigrants were being released from jails. Arpaio, whose contempt of court conviction for disobeying a court order in an immigration case was pardoned by Trump, said he’s a convenient target for people looking to criticize the president. “Why am I the bad guy?” Arpaio asked. “You know why? My name.” ",0,"Man in Trump video was jailed, released under Joe Arpaio"
"In the aftermath of Sunday night’s   that shattered the lives of so many, shell-shocked residents are seeking to make sense of this seemingly senseless act. Why, many are inevitably asking, would someone do such a thing? In truth, we may never know. The Special Investigations Unit, which is probing the circumstances surrounding the death of the suspect, named him late on Monday as 29-year-old Faisal Hussain, of Toronto. The fact that the alleged killer is dead means we cannot ask him about his motivations. Indeed, those who study mass shootings note that because many people who commit such crimes take their own lives, or are killed by police, research into what makes them tick is not as robust as that examining serial killers, for example, who are often questioned for years by law enforcement. A statement from the alleged killer’s family late Monday pointed to Hussain’s lifelong struggle with “severe mental health challenges,” including “psychosis and depression.” The family wrote that the interventions of professionals were not successful. But Hussain also shared a characteristic in common with many mass murderers, one that has received particular attention in the wake of a string of explicitly misogynistic attacks: he was male. “Much of it is this idea that (men) are owed something, or that someone has taken something from them and they must reassert themselves by taking something back,” said Rachel Kalish, a visiting professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Old Westbury and co-author of an article examining the relationship between masculinity and the concept of aggrieved entitlement. “So for example, if a man is passed over for a job, say, and the job is given to a woman, he may feel like that woman ‘stole his job,’ but it was never actually even his to begin with.” She also points to the fact that some men feel they are entitled to women’s attention or women’s bodies. Alek Minassian, the man police say intentionally mowed down pedestrians with a rented van on Yonge St. in April, allegedly posted a Facebook message before the rampage praising American mass murderer Elliot Rodger. Rodger, 22, went on a killing spree in May 2014, in which he murdered six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista, Calif. He then killed himself, but not before emailing a document and posting a video on YouTube explaining his rationale, including his desire to take “retribution” on women who he believed rejected him. Rodger’s message found a captive audience in a community of   who are “involuntarily celibate” and blame women for this, among other things. There is nothing to suggest the Danforth shooter had any link to the incel community. But what we do know, said Michael Kaufman, the sole male member of the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council and co-founder of the White Ribbon Campaign — a worldwide network engaging men to work to end violence against women — is that men who carry out such acts feel a sense of entitlement to take away the lives of others. “Whatever his excuse or rationale, the way he justifies this act, whether it’s his politics or individual hatred of women or something else, we see … a man who feels that he can play God,” said Kaufman, stressing that the overwhelming majority of men do not commit acts of physical or emotional violence. He said this attitude stems from the way society tells boys from a young age that they need to be in control, to be the hero and never back down. “We tell them that they will have all the answers, that they won’t feel pain. But the world isn’t like that. And so what happens is we set boys up for failure,” said Kaufman. “When they can’t live up to the armour-plated expectations of manhood, how do they prove to themselves and the world that they are real men? One solution in a minority of cases is to use violence.” Jooyoung Lee, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, says determining motivations for mass murders is a challenging task given that the reasons are varied and complex. “There are layers of grievances or perceived grievances mixed with potential mental health history, mixed with access to firearms, mixed with both short-term and long-term traumatic experiences that kind of propel a person towards the rage that they feel before they commit a shooting like this,” Lee said. He added that those who have left manifestos, such as Rodger, the Columbine High School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and the Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, provide some clues. “Those manifestos at least allow us to peer inside the thought processes of these killers in the days, weeks and months leading up to the shooting, and you can see very much there is a sense that they’re going to use violence as a way of taking revenge against a society or an institution or people in general who they feel as if they’ve been wronged by,” said Lee.

"We won’t forget. Community organizers of the   are looking for a permanent memorial to the victims of the mass shooting in July that left two dead — 18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis — and 13 injured. The shooting came three months after the North York van attack on Yonge St. that killed 10 people and injured 16 more — a tragedy that was marked with makeshift memorials at Mel Lastman Square and Olive Square Park. Two months ago, city staff dismantled those memorials, with Mayor John Tory saying the city will create a permanent one. As the city grapples with the aftermath of these tragedies — as well as other shootings, and pedestrian and cyclist deaths on the roads — it also faces the question of what should be permanently memorialized and what’s the appropriate way to do so.  A makeshift memorial was placed in front of St. Barnabas Anglican Church on Danforth Ave. during last weekend’s street festival. That memorial, featuring flowers, stuffed animals, candles and other items, was set to be moved this week to the nearby Logan Green Field Parkette. “We are moving the flowers and artifacts from in front of the church because the road needs to be opened again. But it allows us some time to find a permanent concept,” said Howard Lichtman, organizer and spokesperson for Taste of the Danforth. “The flowers, unfortunately, will fade in time and we need to find a permanent solution that has to be right.” Whereas monuments to military exploits and acts of heroism serve to mark the events themselves, the memorial for a seemingly random act of violence serves as a symbol of a community pulling together and supporting each other after the tragedy, said Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough. If made permanent, it can also act as a psychological bridge between the departed and their loved ones, he said. “It’s nice to have some sort of physical thing that we can grieve around,” Joordens said.  “Everybody who lives in that area probably, every now and then, would like to reflect on that. They probably don’t want just to pretend it didn’t happen.” In a statement, Pat Tobin, the city’s director of arts and culture services, said there is no definitive policy for memorials of these unfortunate incidents, adding that the van attack and the Danforth shooting were “precedent-setting occurrences in the city.” “Consultation with the local community, representative agencies, affected family members, local councillors and more would all influence the decision-making process,” he said. Temporary memorials usually remain for 30 days before staff from transportation services remove them, following consultations with affected families and community members, Tobin said. Cities across the world have found various ways to memorialize these types of events. Pulse nightclub in Orlando plans to create a permanent memorial to the victims of the 2016 shooting that left 49 people dead. The site will also have a museum where artifacts and stories of the victims will be displayed, according to CNN. Boston plans to build two memorials made of granite, bronze and glass on Boylston St., where three people were killed and 260 others injured by two bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon, according to the Boston Globe. Joordens said a statue of people holding hands would be an appropriate tribute to the #DanforthStrong messages that showed the community’s strength and social bonds in the face of tragedy. Clare Pain, director of the psychological trauma program at Mount Sinai Hospital, said memorializing people’s names — as long as it’s culturally appropriate — is important. She said it’s equally vital to think of something that can bring positive change to the future of a community. “So a memorial can be people’s names, inscribed somehow, but also scholarships for young women, or something that goes on into the future, not just something that’s static,” she said. During Taste of the Danforth, organizers with the Greektown Business Improvement Area varnished the existing hoarding from a building under construction that had been turned into a memorial board and placed it in front of St. Barnabas, while shutting down a lane of the street. The trick now is to find a permanent home for the memorial, which Lichtman says may or may not include the hoarding. “We want to do the right thing. Not the rushed thing,” said Lichtman. “We have to sit down with the community and the people who were affected and make a decision. We have to be respectful to the families and we have to see what the range of opinions are out there.” The memorial could take many forms, whether it is a work of art, a plaque or the renaming of a public area. But Lichtman said the organization has purposely not tried to generate a list until they speak to the community. “We’re not going to make a rash decision. And a great idea can come from anywhere. We don’t have a monopoly.” Litchman said this year’s festival — the 25th edition, which saw visits from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mayor John Tory — broke records with upwards of 1.64 million visitors. “There was a mood of bitterness and sorrow but also defiance, like, we’re going to make this happen,” he said of the support the community received.

"Maybe the game — the second in an 82-game marathon — was overhyped just a little bit, but the   and Boston Celtics did come up with a gem on Friday.  There were enough bobbles and mistakes to make sure everyone knew it was just game two for each team, but Toronto’s 113-101 victory at Scotiabank Arena was a delightful early-season NBA contest. The presumptive top two teams in the Eastern Conference went toe-to-toe for the entire night before Toronto pulled away in the final minute. Kawhi Leonard had 31 points, while Kyle Lowry drew a charge on one play and hit a game-sealing three the next for the Raptors, who also got a huge 21-point contribution from Serge Ibaka.  Toronto’s offence is certainly not fully in sync — no one expects it to be after just two regular-season games — and they had only 24 assists on 42 field goals on the night. The all-backup unit of Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, C.J. Miles, OG Anunoby and Jonas Valanciunas was particularly out of sync, going almost three minutes of the first quarter without a basket. With two rosters full of versatile defenders, every matchup changed with every screen set because both teams love to switch. It’s the way the game’s going. “If you’re in scramble mode the whole time, these guys move the ball and find the next guy,” Boston coach Brad Stevens said. “Then you’re not only scrambling to challenge, you’re scrambling to rebound. That’s one of the reasons people want to switch more. That’s one of the reasons why people want to keep everything in front of them and try to guard those layups and three-pointers as best they can, because it helps them rebound if they can maintain a matchup.”  Anunoby, who bruised his right orbital bone in Wednesday’s game, sported goggles for the first quarter of Game 2 but dumped them going into the second quarter. “We were joking around about that (Thursday). I said, ‘Are you going with (Kurt) Rambis or Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) or Horace Grant?’ and he said, ‘None of those. I gotta get some good ones,’” coach Nick Nurse said, naming a trio of goggle-wearing NBA icons. Nurse was asked if Anunoby, just 21 years old, would know those names. “I’m not sure. He did not let on that he did not know who they were.”  To take advantage of a matchup with Boston’s Al Horford, Toronto inserted Serge Ibaka into the starting lineup to replace Jonas Valanciunas. Ibaka made three of four field goals in his first eight minutes.  Boston’s Gordon Hayward remains on a minutes restriction, 25 per game, as he comes back from missing the entire 2017-18 season. He did not start the second half after playing 12 minutes in the first … Delon Wright (adductor strain) missed his second straight game for Toronto … The Raptors haven’t lost a season series to Boston since 2012-13. The teams play three more times this season.  The NBA has done a good job of easing travel woes and trying to schedule in rest for every team, but there are still moments — like now for the Raptors. They head to Washington on Saturday to face a rested Wizards team (which lost its season opener on Thursday) while it will be the third game in four nights for the Raptors. Oh, and it’s a rematch of last year’s first playoff round, if that matters. ",0,Game centre: Raptors pull away late to ring up Celtics
"Renting a condo in Toronto’s Beach neighbourhood these days costs, on average, just under $2,500 a month, according to real estate website Zoocasa. But those prices haven’t been a concern for   for a long time.  The   designer and stylist moved into her two-bedroom rental on the upper level of a Beach house nearly a decade ago, and staying put meant she’s locked into a price most millennials won’t find easily now. Though Pratt, 37, won’t say how much exactly she pays, she says she only recently got her first rent increase. “I’m lucky because I’ve been here for a long time, so I’m kind of grandfathered in,” she says. The apartment, just under 1,200 square feet including the patio, is just a few metres up the street from the lake. It’s a reflection of Pratt’s signature vibrant style, following about a year of major renovations when she redid everything from the walls to floors to lighting and more.  A rainbow staircase at the entrance ends at a hallway that leads to two bedrooms and a bathroom towards the back of the home, and the kitchen, living and dining rooms towards the front. Because most of Pratt’s work with crafts, designs and photography is done at home, the living room doubles as an office, with a built-in workspace on one wall. “Most people don’t live as pink as I do,” she says. As a kid, Pratt moved back and forth between her mom’s home in Florida and her dad’s in Brantford, Ont. She moved to New York City in her 20s, working her way up through the business world from a personal shopper at Saks Fifth Avenue, and helped run an art studio for children in Connecticut before choosing to settle down in Toronto to be close to her sisters. Pratt now shares her home with her new puppy, Poppy. “It’s an old lady with a really good face job,” she says. I don’t think that’s something I feel is good to advertise. (My friend) is currently renting a unit very similar to mine. I think it’s $2,100. I did look at a property two doors down that faces the water and it was the exact layout of my house for $2,400. Newly renovated. But I would say what I’ve done with mine is more newly renovated than that. To buy down by water, this close, it’s lunatic. Quiet. Very safe. Forty per cent of the shops have closed in the last year and a half, so it’s like no man’s land up on Queen St. It literally feels like a desolate weird small town. And everyone knows everyone. I love the Beach. I’m saddened that we don’t have as many businesses as it could. But living here to me is just peaceful.  I don’t care. For me, all the extra time getting in and out of this place is worth it for the beach. The extra 15 or 20 minutes that I’m stuck sitting in traffic, or even sometimes an hour, it doesn’t even faze me because the end game is that I’m here and I hear the lake and I see the stars.  I’m an exclusive driver a), because I’m a control freak. I don’t have the kind of job where I have the luxury of time and I also usually have something in my car, like I’m taking things to and from or I’m picking something up.  Although the place is not gigantic, it still has assigned rooms. Like I have a proper dining room, living room. It’s not like a condo where it’s a shared space where you have to have a living, dining, kitchen all sort of in one. Because of the way it’s laid out, you do get to maximize the rooms, so it does have a feeling of spaciousness. In Toronto, very rarely can you get a place like this with two bedrooms, the way they’re sectioned. That it’s on the second floor. The nature of my work is hauling stuff and creating things, and bringing things up and down the stairs is a b----. I wish that there was a time-lapse camera over the past years to watch the stuff I’ve had to carry out of here. Installations, things I created for weddings, chandeliers, boxes. At the same time the second floor is amazing because I don’t hear anything and I only see treetops. So it feels like I’m living in a tree house. I don’t necessarily ever see myself giving this place up. I’m hoping that at some point my landlord will just sell me the property because I’ve been here for so long. Deals like what I could get here are only going to be done person-to-person, not through the real estate market. Because if it’s through the real estate market, I will not be able to afford it. I’m also not married to owning anything. And I do not really like the idea that I would have to sink a lot of my cash into like my heater blowing up or whatever. That is still (my landlord’s) responsibility and if something goes wrong, it’s on him. The lifestyle out here is not that of a person that wants to be in the middle of it all. So if there’s a millennial who wants to come out here, I think it’s the type to enjoy a little bit more peace and a little bit more nature. And also, you’re not going to get a flashy condo down here. Everything in the Beach is old. I really wasn’t going for anything. I think I was going for happiness. I like to mix things together that other people wouldn’t, but then they see it and they go, ‘Oh yeah, that works.’ Like the outdoor swinging chair. I worked on the kitchen with Home Depot in 2016. Once we improved the kitchen, everything else looked like s---. When you start improvements, it’s like a domino effect. You have to be careful because once you start, you can’t stop. I had a handful of men that were in and out of my house so much last year that it was like I was Murphy Brown and these guys were my Eldin. It took a year. I didn’t really have one. As each room was progressing, I kind of had to look at it as a monthly spend. Because I’m self-employed, every month was different. Some months I could spend enough and really go for it and other months I had to row back and wait. I would say on my house alone, it was a minimum of $3,000 a month, if not more.  I’d only live in the Beach. ",0,Check this space: Tiffany Pratt’s pink and peaceful Beach home
"The Ontario government may delay — and possibly change — legislation brought in by the previous Liberals to narrow the gender wage gap. Labour Minister Laurie Scott said the  , may not come into effect Jan. 1. “We are looking into the implementation of it and the challenges that may be occurring with some businesses,” Scott told reporters at Queen’s Park. “We believe, certainly, in the principle of the pay transparency — it’s just the timing.” Scott said the government supports “parts of the Pay Transparency Act,” but the issue is “engaging with the business community and how the process is to be done.” The act, which passed before the election, was an effort to close the gender wage gap — as high as 30 per cent in some sectors — by forcing employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings and also to track wages by gender and diversity and report back to the province. Companies would also be banned from asking job candidates about their current or previous salary.  The law was based on similar legislation in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, and was a first in Canada. Former Liberal labour minister  , based on other countries’ success, that it would lower the wage gap by about 15 per cent.  NDP Leader Andrea Horwath — who had previously criticized the former Liberal government for taking so long to act — said the current Ford government can’t just cater to businesses, it also has to look after workers. “I just wonder how much further this government can drag us backwards,” she said. “It’s 2018, and women should not be earning the same wages as everyone else? People should not be able to ask their employer how much wages the co-workers, that they work beside, are earning?  “It is just backwards.” A written statement from Scott’s office said “the government understands that concerns have been raised about the Pay Transparency Act and is reviewing the legislation and its impact on the overall economy. “The plan is to create and protect jobs by sending the message that Ontario is open for business” and to work “cooperatively with the people of Ontario, including small businesses, to reduce the burdens they face.” Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said he doesn’t think the reforms are onerous. The Guelph MPP used to run his own small business and “you can push a button and get a payroll report — you can redact out names without a problem. “I don’t see it as a major reporting burden — it’s certainly less of a burden than remitting HST.” News of the likely delay comes as the government also overhauls labour legislation, freezing the minimum wage at $14 for the next two years and doing away with two paid sick days for workers. Instead of up to 10 days off — including the two paid days in cases of illness — the Ford government is proposing to provide workers with three sick days, two bereavement days and three personal days, all unpaid.

"Faith Goldy and her thousands of alt-right, nationalist, white supremacist supporters in Toronto and abroad must have felt like winners on municipal election night. Yes, John Tory was re-elected mayor as predicted and Jennifer Keesmaat finished a distant second with 24 per cent of the votes. But, in a field of 35 candidates for mayor, Goldy easily topped the rest. The final vote tally shows 25,667 Torontonians voted for Goldy — a virtual unknown until she crashed mayoral debates she wasn’t invited to participate in and Premier Doug Ford posed with her and her supporters and then for days refused to distance himself from her. You’d be missing the point if you are complacent about the fact that only 3.4 per cent of voters opted for the ethnonationalist considered too toxic for a far-right media site where she was a star of the unabashedly pro-white movement. Rebel Media fired her after she appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast. Since before the turn of the century, avowed white supremacist Don Andrews has been the standard-bearer for that kind of odious platform in Toronto’s municipal elections. Andrews’ practice was to register and not campaign. In the 2003, 2010, and 2014 elections, Andrews’ poll numbers went from 1,220 votes to 1,012 or about one-tenth of 1 per cent of voters — truly fringe. By comparison, Goldy received more than 1,000 votes in each of 12 of the 25 city wards last month. In Ward 1, territory of the Ford dynasty, where the MPP is the premier of Ontario — the same Premier Doug Ford who was photographed with Goldy at his annual Ford Fest, Goldy got 1,098 votes. Goldy’s highest support came in the leafy south-central sections of Etobicoke. She received 2,077 votes in Ward 2 and 1,772 in Ward 3. In one Ward 2 neighbourhood, poll 60, Goldy outscored Keesmaat 24-22 and tied Keesmaat (49-49) in poll number 33 of the same ward. Unless you are an ethnonationalist, alt-right propagandist, neo-con, white supremacist, populist, anti-immigrant — you get the idea — you probably hadn’t heard of Steve Bannon before he and Donald Trump found each other and carved a path to the White House. Unless you harbour one or more of those belief systems here in Toronto you probably hadn’t heard about Faith Goldy until she entered the race for mayor of Toronto and demanded she be given “serious candidate” status and be included in the mayoral debates. The moment her participation in mayoral debates became an issue, thousands more heard about her. The moment Premier Doug Ford appeared to give her tacit approval when, for three days he refused to distance himself from Goldy, tens of thousands were drawn to her. Goldy was also politically astute in challenging decisions to ban her from debates. She hired high-profile lawyer Clayton Ruby for a legal challenge to Bell Media’s refusal to air her campaign ads. (The court ruled against her). All told, the controversy gave Goldy a profile she craved. That’s why opponents felt it better to silence the candidate rather than include her in civil discourse. Such opponents argue that Goldy would have received even more votes had mainstream media, election organizers and civil society allowed her to share the platform and propagate her views. That view has merit. But freedom of speech is never an easy accommodation — especially in matters of importance. Steve Bannon and Faith Goldy are cases in point. Uncomfortable as it is, it would be a mistake to ban U.S. far-right nationalist and Trump whisperer   in Toronto. That would only heighten interest in his rhetoric and multiply the number of citizens introduced to his views, as if eating the forbidden fruit. Better to dismantle the man’s arguments and ideas in front of everyone. Or, at least, challenge them; declare them unwelcome, without broad appeal. Goldy proved to be a different challenge. For one, it is impossible to decide which of the 33 “fringe candidates” should be included in an election debate. Her platform promised to evict illegals from homeless shelters and give the shelters back to homeless Canadians, provide subsidized housing only to people born in Canada, stop illegal immigration, monitor imams and Islamic organizations to possibly revoke the permits of mosques where extreme views are taught, and reinstitute carding, the discredited police practice of routinely demanding Black and brown people answer police questions, even when they are not being investigated. She also shares many Ford Nation views that attract the very immigrants her more controversial views target: subways over LRTs, unfriendliness towards bike lanes and traffic-calming, tough-on-crime, anti-refugee, limits on social housing, low taxes. There’s a direct line linking the high-profile, far-right personalities and the less careful and nuanced racists who are easy to condemn. They are on the same train heading to a future that is violent, divisive and destructive. Some are near the front of the train, others are in the middle. Ignoring them has not and will not work. Censoring them destroys who we profess to be.  Confronting them and calling them out is a better strategy — especially when their utterances and policies are couched in coded words and ideas we have long deciphered as dog whistles intended to rally the like-minded under an invisible banner. Evil grows in the dark. Open debate is a disinfectant, not something to fear. ",0,Banning far-right figures does more harm than good
"Politics ruins transit planning. We all know this. Everyone complains about it all the time.  So getting politics out of transit planning is a popular concept. In general, in theory. Until you start to really think about what it might mean, in practice.  The thing is, transit planning is inherently political. That’s maddening, sometimes, but I don’t see a good way around it. Which doesn’t stop people from trying.  A few times every year, some well-meaning politician or think tank or civic organization comes out with a suggestion for how we can take the politics out of transit, usually by some sort of shuffling of the organizational structure. Most recently in the news, we have the Toronto Region Board of Trade with a proposal for a “Superlinx” Toronto-Hamilton-Waterloo area transit agency that would take over responsibility for all of our commutes. They made the suggestion in a  , but this week   showing a big majority of the general public supports the idea.  On the specifics of the proposal, I’ll say it’s one of those things that makes all kinds of sense in theory, but seems sketchier in practice. First of all, the TTC leaves many of us wanting in many ways, but it is undeniably excellent at moving people. It dwarfs all of the other transit agencies it would be merging with — TTC buses alone carry more than five times as many passengers per day than the entire GO bus and train network. The TTC carries 2.76 million passengers per day, to GO’s 250,000. Taking control away from their management and putting it in the hands of provincial appointees who have never had to run such a large organization seems like a recipe for failure.  But it’s not just that I don’t trust the province to put the right people in charge (they could, after all, put the TTC in charge of the whole new Superlinx). It’s that whoever is in charge will face the new politics of a regional transit system. The politics don’t suddenly disappear, they just get more complicated.  Note that Metrolinx, the existing GTA regional transit agency, was supposed to take the politics out of transit planning when it was created, and anyone who has followed it closely will automatically note that if anything, it has been more subject to the blowing of the political winds (both municipal and provincial) than the TTC. I don’t think those politics favour good local service. I mentioned the massive reach of the TTC buses. Their ability to move people reliably, especially in the inner suburbs, through their frequent-service schedules and integration with the subway system, has long been considered a phenomenal transit success story by observers  . Part of how it achieves that is by providing regular service even in places where it loses money — where ridership doesn’t seem to justify the level of service. It provides this service across the city, and people from across the city pay for it (and, I’d argue, benefit from it).  But if you’re a transit service with a regional mandate, now how do you try to justify every-five-minute service on Midland Ave. when riders in Newmarket are looking at service every 35 minutes in rush hour and once an hour on the weekend? If you think the political debates about who “deserves” a subway line near their house (and which “elites” should shoulder how much of the costs) in Toronto today are insufferable, just wait until they take place across an entire suburban-urban-rural megalopolis of dozens of municipalities.  (You want a case study? New York state   North America’s biggest and proudest subway system, in New York City, in 1968, and have famously managed to  . Upstate voters, it turns out, don’t see maintenance of the big-city system as that high a priority.)  Local service has to remain under local control. Regional planning should involve regional co-ordination, for sure, but we have to be careful not to ruin what’s already working when we go about restructuring.  And those insufferable debates are pretty much unavoidable. Much as we complain about it, “politics” is just the term for the process we use to make decisions together. In our system, we make those decisions through elected representatives who answer directly to us.  The fantasy of a panel of benevolent-dictator experts who are above politics is attractive to indulge, until you realize that means someone spending your money to transform your neighbourhood without any accountability to you. I cannot imagine that we would take responsibility for decisions about hundreds of billions of our dollars and massive city- and region-defining transportation infrastructure projects and somehow hive it away from the control of the people we elect to represent us.  I mean, they screw it all up, frequently. But only because we want them to. I mean, we must. We elect them to do it. That’s politics. And yes, it’s the worst, except in comparison to the alternatives. ",0,Why Toronto’s transit system should remain under Toronto’s control
"Unlike many tenants in Toronto, Jim McCarthy isn’t mad about yet another tall tower that’s popping up in his backyard. He has lived in an apartment at 45 Dunfield Ave. for nearly 20 years, and when Shiplake Properties Ltd. came up with a proposal two years ago for two new purpose-built rental towers in the area, he and other tenants figured they had to fight back. “The height of the buildings, the fact that they were going to be in our backyard, essentially taking away our visitors parking and our pool, and they weren’t offering any compensation whatsoever, we didn’t think that was fair,” McCarthy said. The proposal, known as the  , sought to add two apartment buildings in the Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood. With 26 and 24 storeys each, the apartments would have a total of 519 rental units. Construction is already underway and expected to finish by summer 2019. McCarthy and other tenants at 45 Dunfield — one of the existing rental buildings in the area also owned by Shiplake — came together through their   to challenge the proposal and demand a compensation package. The tenants threatened to take the issue up to the Ontario Municipal Board or the Landlord and Tenant Board. By April last year, the tenants and the developer had agreed on a compensation package totalling nearly $1 million, through a new process housing advocates believe could serve as a blueprint on how tenants deal with landlords in the future. According  , each existing tenant (there are a total of 575 units at the building) received $200 upfront to put toward the purchase of an air conditioner or something else. Shiplake also agreed to a total of $200,000 to be carved off future rent for tenants in the units closest to the construction site. In addition, tenants who were regular users of the swimming pool got a monthly rent rebate of about $20 or a pass to a community centre, until the new pool is built. Perhaps more importantly, a 2.6 per cent above guideline rent increase that Shiplake had previously sought to apply after some renovation work will be suspended for at least 16 months starting from the time construction began. The city also negotiated a daycare centre to be constructed at one of the buildings in the area, and existing tenants have the option to demand relocation to a similar size unit away from the construction. In an attempt to mitigate noise, the hours of construction are restricted from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, with no weekend work. McCarthy said there was a feeling among some tenants that they could have gotten more out of the negotiations if they held on a little longer, but the compensation package they got is a sign of what tenants are capable of achieving. “I think it’s important that people understand what their rights are. They don’t just have to accept these different proposals that landlords are inflicting on them,” he said. Shiplake management did not respond to requests for comment by publishing deadline.  brought some success to tenants opposing landlords’ attempts to raise rent above the set provincial guidelines. But cases of negotiations between renters and building owners are still rare. Two years ago, a tenant association, also in the Yonge-Eglinton area,   for rental discounts and moving allowances for the construction of new condos, with the help of OMB. Wendy Lum, an organizer with the Federation of Metro Tenants’ Association who assisted McCarthy and others in this case, said tenants don’t have to feel powerless whenever they see a sign on their lawns about a rezoning application. They can attend community consultations, attend city planning meetings and voice their opinions, she said. “The unfortunate thing with tenants is, they’re literally being bulldozed and becoming overwhelmed,” she said, adding she hopes more tenant groups across the city will follow suit and realize they can have a say in what happens in their neighbourhoods. “These tenants have sent a strong message. Tenants everywhere deserve more consideration as these are their homes and it is not just about profits, but about people too.” ",0,Toronto tenants win big compensation from developer of new Yonge-Eglinton buildings
"He was a rabbinical student, a husband, father to a month-old baby girl. Shot and killed because he was a Jew. Outside a Torah study centre. In Pittsburgh’s leafy Squirrel Hill neighbourhood. That was more three decades ago, April 17, 1986. Neal Rosenblum, from Toronto, had been in the city for only seven hours, visiting his in-laws for Passover. He looked like what he was — an Orthodox Jew, with the hat and the cloth belt, the long dark coat and the beard. Easy to spot on that overcast day — he’d turned down an offer of a ride to walk home — when two men in a car beckoned him over, pretending to ask for directions.  Rosenblum, 24, was struck by five bullets — in the abdomen, chest, arms and leg. Sixteen years and three mistrials later, Stephen Tielsch, a drug dealer with a swastika tattoo, was convicted of third-degree murder. “I’d … like to remind the community the theory upon which we proceeded in this case was that the motive in this case was hate,” District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. said after the trial. On Thursday, Arthur Rosenblum clicked on a YouTube re-enactment of the crime that took his son’s life. “I just saw the video for the first time,” he told the Star. “I thought I was going to have a heart attack.” Not a day has gone by that it doesn’t hurt. But the pain was most profound, stirring up every traumatic memory, following  at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, same Squirrel Hill district –— 11 Jews at prayer on the Sabbath slain by a gunman who shouted: “All Jews must die!” The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, had just posted an ominous statement on the fringe social media website Gab, favoured by the alt-right: “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered … Screw your optics, I’m going in.” In his profile, within a sludge pit of bigotry and anti-Semitism, Bowers wrote: “Jews are the children of Satan.” Throughout history, it has always been thus for Jews, persecuted and banished, subjected to pogroms and purges. Stripped of their possessions, slaughtered, gassed. Blamed. For everything from a worldwide banking conspiracy to 9/11. Reviled by the hard right, more latterly by the hard left (proponents of the execrable Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel — but really, Jews), a wide swath of the overseas Muslim world and an amorphous rump of tacit Jew-haters, the ones who claim not to be anti-Semitic at all. They lie. “This has been going on for centuries,” says Mr. Rosenblum, 85, who still lives in North York with his wife, Penina. “It’s hard to be a Jew.’’ Murdered as they pray, as they play, in holiday resorts, on city buses in Jerusalem, at the beach, in school, in nightclubs, in their homes. Their places of worship and their cemeteries are constantly defaced and desecrated. More than half of religiously motivated hate crimes in the U.S. since 2010 have targeted Jews, according to FBI figures; higher than that says the U.S. Anti-Defamation League. The most targeted minority in Canada too, according to 2016 Statistics Canada figures. Continuing a trend that dates back to 2008, Jews were the most victimized for hate crimes in Toronto, jumping to 186 incidents — 28 per cent of the total — last year, as per the Toronto Police Service’s annual Hate Crimes Statistical Report, far more than Blacks, Muslims and the LGBTQ communities. In Pittsburgh, Bowers was quickly taken into custody by law enforcement. The suspect was armed with three Glocks and an AR-15 assault rifle. On Thursday,  to 44 charges, including 11 counts of murder and 11 counts of obstructing free exercise of religious beliefs — hate crimes. Six individuals, including four police officers, were wounded in what was the worst anti-Semitic incident in U.S. history. Entering the courtroom in a wheelchair — he was injured in a shootout with cops — Bowers responded with a loud “Yes!” when asked if he understood the charges against him. The man who murdered Rosenblum, for no bloody reason, used a .40 calibre pistol. Like the events of late Saturday, the shooting trigged apprehension, vulnerability and demonstrations of solidarity. But that shooter had fled the scene in the vehicle. Police had no motive. “We had no evidence to suggest that this was a terrorist hit,” Police Lt. William Mullen told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “But we are not ruling out the fact that his man was killed because he was Jewish.” As time passed, even Rosenblum’s family began to think that maybe it had been a hit-job gone wrong, maybe something to do with drugs, mistaken identity; had nothing to do with Jew-hatred. In 1988, a jailhouse informant told police his cellmate had bragged about shooting Rosenblum yet the homicide remained unsolved until 2000 when cold case detectives found a second, corroborating witness. Tielsch, who was in jail after pleading to drug-trafficking charges, was arrested and charged with murder. At the first trial, the star witness informant — himself Jewish — testified that Tielsch drew swastikas on his forehead and routinely made anti-Semitic remarks while they shared a cell. Yet three trials over two years ended in a deadlock.  “We went down for all the trials,” said Mr. Rosenblum, recalling the family’s dismay. “We wondered, what kind of justice is there for Jews? But I give credit to the detectives. They didn’t want to give up.” Even at the fourth and final trial, in 2002, the judge ruled jurors could not be told about the defendant’s swastika tattoo on his leg. They found Tielsch guilty anyway. He was sentenced to 10-20 years in prison. Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.

"It has always dismayed that murderers behind bars, even serial sex predators, have their fan-girl devotees. No doubt that is its own pathology. One woman enraptured with Paul Bernardo was, like the object of her warped desire, later  herself. She had written threatening letters to the family of one of his victims, stabbed an ex-boyfriend, set her apartment on fire and slashed a security guard at the University Ave. courthouse. A girl after his own heart. This was not the female with whom the notorious schoolgirl-killer had conducted an intense highly sexualized six-week relationship in 2014, via letters and phone calls, a hookup that repeated — at least in fantasy — all of Bernardo’s well-documented sexual deviances. Bernardo admitted to prison psychiatrists masturbating himself into a frenzy over thoughts of that woman, resurrecting the crime cycle, albeit imagined, of control and debasement and humiliation. In a correctional plan update from earlier this year, Bernardo disclosed that his current closest friend is a woman he described as a feminist who “has all the control in the relationship.” Days before his Oct. 17 Parole Board of Canada hearing, Bernardo wrote to the board, claiming a “miscommunication” in characterizing the relationship and, goodness no, he would never be involved in such a one-sided liaison because that would be unhealthy. “The Board believes that you still view relationships in terms of power and control, reflecting your limited progress in understanding what a healthy relationship should look like,” states the explanatory written decision released Tuesday by the two-member parole board panel which had  . The reference to this current relationship is but a brief observation in the 10-page decision summary, a document weighed heavily towards Bernardo’s unsatisfying risk assessment monitoring, psychiatric testing, specialized sex offender assessment and so forth. But it underscores the reality of rehabilitation — or lack of it — for sexual offenders, particularly an individual diagnosed for severe sexual sadism, voyeurism and paraphilia not otherwise specified, as well as narcissistic personality disorder. He’s a psychopath. Psychopaths are unlikely to change, ever, no matter the lies and insincere remorse and psychobabble spouted at a parole hearing. Bernardo’s repentance, if it can be depicted as such, was a long-winded tissue of deception, larded with self-diagnosis of low self-esteem, anxiety disorder, “victim stance thinking” and parent-blaming, though he’s latterly recanted that last part. “You mentioned at the hearing that you have come to the realization that your parents are not to blame. Your discovery seems to be recent as the issue of close family relationships is mentioned repeatedly in your file.” The “no-contact” offender — meaning he’s in lockdown for 23 hours a day and the range is cleared when he’s allowed out of his cell at Millhaven — claimed to also have had an “aha” moment of insight and responsibility, albeit well into the quarter century of incarceration. “You agreed with the Board that you displayed several personality traits associated to psychopaths such as being callous, glib, grandiose, cunning, deceptive, manipulative and a liar. You now claim to have changed and say that these traits are not part of your personality anymore. You describe yourself as a nice and compassionate guy. “You told the Board that your participating in programs helped you appreciate that you had built up all kinds of justifications for your crimes over the years. You profess to understand now that there is nothing that could justify your horrific behaviour.” The decision notes that, at the hearing, Bernardo avoided speaking about sexual self-gratification and the violent nature of his crimes, not only against the two teenage girls he abducted and murdered but the more than a dozen young women he subsequently admitted raping. Those were his Scarborough Rapist days, including his pre-Karla Homolka era. “You told the Board you had no intention of hurting the women you sexually assaulted. The Board reminded you that you used a rope and a knife against several of the victims … There seems to be a dissociation between your view of yourself and your criminal behaviour and this is apparent throughout your file as it was at the hearing.” Adding: “The empathy that you now claim to have for the victims is quite recent considering that you have been jailed for 25 years and have showed little sign of caring for the victims for most of that time.” What Bernardo, summoning up tears, told the panel a fortnight ago: “What I did was so dreadful. I hurt a lot of people. I cry all the time.” His continuing objectification of women was certainly evident in a 600-page “autobiography,” written as part of a 2009 treatment assignment, in which Bernardo lingered over the physical attributes of former girlfriends   his two murder victims. Their bra sizes. Intended, he said, to emphasize that the girls looked like adult women and he didn’t want to be mistaken for a pedophile. Bernardo, 54, clearly realized he wasn’t going to be successful in obtaining even restricted day parole. Not at this time. But he can reapply in two years and every two years after that. What he’s doing, if ineffectively at this moment, is laying down the foundation for future release, probably by assessing where he went wrong with the panel — because he’ll read this written decision also. While Bernardo’s reintegration potential has been assessed as low, demanding an “extremely gradual release,” the next “logical step,” as noted by a psychologist in a 2016 risk assessment report, would be for the felon to work towards a reduction in institutional security. Meaning, some day being transferred to mid-security penitentiary, with broader freedoms earned. Although, even now, the “no-contact” regime is not quite as rigid it seems. Bernardo has already enjoyed escorted temporary passes outside the institution for medical appointments. And he’s participated in a group counselling sessions for sexual deviants. Indeed, just a couple of days before his hearing, Bernardo said he was offered pornography by an unidentified individual. Virtuously: “I didn’t take it.” ",0,Paul Bernardo is laying the groundwork for his eventual release
"He was ambushed, had duct-tape wrapped around his face, got pistol-whipped, beaten and stabbed several times. Yet Christopher Husbands is not the victim. He is the trim, neatly dressed defendant in the dock, charged with two counts of second-degree murder, five counts of aggravated assault, criminal negligence and reckless discharge of a firearm. Husbands was indisputably — admits this — the shooter who opened fire in the Eaton Centre food court six years ago, sending innocent bystanders scrambling for cover and stampeding out of the downtown mall. It was an attack that shocked even a jaded city. So heedless.  He killed two young men, one of whom died on the spot, the other succumbing to his grievous injuries nine days later. But on Monday morning, the now 29-year-old pleaded not guilty to all the charges, despite videos which the jury will see of Husbands reaching into his satchel bag for the gun and spraying that food court with bullets until the weapon was empty. The defence, as made clear in their opening statement, will seek a finding of not criminally responsible. The argument is that Husbands was in a dissociative mental state, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder arising from a vicious attack against him by half a dozen males some four months earlier. On his way to visit a female friend, he’d been jumped, dragged into an empty apartment, tormented by a group of men — some of whom removed their masks — and, as a bathtub was filled with water, totally believing he was about to be killed. Instead, they released Husbands before lamming it. He staggered outside, bleeding, and collapsed in the middle of Gerrard St. On June 2, 2012, while at the Eaton Centre with his girlfriend, Husbands saw five men walking by. He thought he recognized two of them as his assailants. He thought that one of them, Nixon Nirmalendran, directed his younger brother, Nisan, to shoot him. He allegedly saw Nisan move his hand towards his pocket, as if reaching for a firearm. Nixon Nirmalendran would be critically wounded. Ahmed Hassan was killed. They had all known each other, growing up in Regent Park, Husbands moving to Toronto to live with his dad, leaving behind a crack-addicted HIV-positive mother. Husbands and siblings had been removed from their inattentive mother’s home by their grandmother. Regent Park, defence lawyer Stephanie DiGiuseppe told the jury, was a culture shock for the boy. “Mr. Husbands was exposed to racism — often directed at him — poverty, crime, drug dealing and significant violence from a young age. When he was just 13 years old, he was playing with a friend outside his apartment complex and he saw a man die from a gunshot to the head.” He grew up into a street criminal himself, drug-dealing. But it was the horrific assault — he never revealed the assailants’ names to police — that turned him into a twitchy, paranoid, hypervigilant, deeply traumatized individual plagued by flashbacks, said DiGiuseppe, convinced that the attackers would eventually come back and finish off the job. That leeriness, said DiGiuseppe, is why he carried a gun whenever he left his home. A gun which has never been found. “Certainly during the time following the stabbing, Christopher Husbands was very, very afraid,” said DiGiuseppe. “He will testify that he feared for his life. He experienced intense stress and intense fear every day. “I expect he will tell you he was very confused. He did not understand why he had been the target of such a vicious attack.” Crown Attorney Mary Humphrey laid the groundwork for the prosecution with a radically different outline of the case, although the details — the scene, the shooting, the killing, the chaos, the wounded bystanders, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the head — don’t change. It was, Humphrey told the jury, “street justice,” inflicted by Husbands for the stabbing four months previous. Husbands, she said, wanted retribution, saw his assailants, and seized it. He’d merely been waiting for the opportunity and that’s why he always went about armed. “It is the Crown theory that he had a simple plan to shoot them when he saw them. It is the Crown theory that he wanted to execute his own street justice.” Humphrey knows this case inside-out. She was the Crown who prosecuted Husbands in 2015. Justice Brian O’Marra told the jury before opening addresses that there had been “a prior trial in this matter” but did not explain why a second trial is now being held. “Do not speculate about what happened at the end of that trial. Or why we are here again.” In her narrative, which isn’t evidence, Humphrey drew the tableau. “It was a busy night, family and friends gathered to eat dinner. At approximately 6:22 that evening, the busy food court turned to chaos. Christopher Husbands opened fire and killed two men and injured six others.” While his girlfriend was ordering food at Sushi Q, Husbands stood in a corner, black satchel draped across his body, looking out into the food court. The five men came down the escalator and walked past him. “No argument was heard by anybody in the food court.” Witnesses will testify, said Humphrey, they heard Husbands yelling “What?” One is expected to testify he heard someone yelling “What’s up?” in a rude manner. As the men kept moving forward, Husbands took aim, emptying 14 rounds. Nixon Nirmalendran was 22 years old. Ahmed Hassan was 24. “These two young men were not the only casualties from the gunfire,” Humphrey continued. “Innocent bystanders were also harmed from the fired bullets that may have traveled through several different bodies or ricocheted off floors, walls or pillars.” Connor Stevenson, the boy shot in the head. He’d come downtown with his mother and children to see a play at the Mirvish Theatre, then to the Eaton Centre for a bite. Tasnuva Mahmood, in the company of a friend from Boston, shot in the leg, just above the knee. Nicholas Kalakonis, window-shopping at the mall, shot in the upper thigh. Qin Chen, grazed by a bullet across her abdomen. Hanna Finger, struck in the finger. Kessia Frederick, seven months pregnant at the time, trampled by the panicked crowd, injuring wrist, shoulder and leg muscles, and going into premature contractions. Husbands fled the scene amidst the havoc. He turned himself into police two days later. The trial is expected to last two months.

"It’s rare that a piece of off-beat local news footage is quite so on the nose. The kind of gotta-see-this WTF item that ends a TV news segment or makes the rounds on social media — and in the process provides an all-purpose metaphor for the sinking feeling of contemporary life.  I’m talking, of course, about the TTC Wheel Trans supervisor’s car in the Port Lands. There it was, early on Tuesday morning near Commissioner’s St. and Logan Ave., after a water main broke and flooded the streets: Car 104, marked with the TTC logo and familiar red and black stripes, its headlights on and the yellow flashers on the roof strobing, stopped at the side of the road.  The supervisor the car belonged to was   on the scene to assess the situation to determine how it might affect service plans. The water was up to the front tire wells, when a sinkhole opened up beneath it and began to swallow the car.  As bystanders watched and cameras rolled, the car lurched down, in stages, into the sometimes gurgling puddle. Something gave way and the back passenger-side tire dropped a foot or two, then the whole thing gently levelled lower, inch by inch, until suddenly the hood dropped down underwater and the trunk bobbed up slightly.  “Oh, it’s going!” someone shouted on   I saw. But not too quickly. It continued tilting grill-first into the ground, over the course of excruciating, fascinating minutes, until the windshield was submerged, and then those blinking yellow lights. Eventually, the trunk and still-shining tail lights went under, and the car was gone. You see something like that and think: Geez, I can relate.   I mean, who doesn’t sometimes feel like something like that is happening to them? Or maybe to us? You’re focused on your day-to-day tasks — jobs you think are important and urgent. Meanwhile, forces you can neither see nor control are colliding beneath you. The corrosion of fundamental, mostly invisible infrastructure that has perhaps been forgotten and neglected reaches a breaking point and suddenly you’re soaking in it. Natural and human forces grind against each other in undetectable ways over a long period of time until suddenly the very ground beneath you opens up and sucks you down into the muck. And the lights and insignia and blinking signals that have indicated what you thought was your mission sink with it.  “Oh, it’s going!”  It’s a feeling that can overtake you sometimes. Maybe not usually so literally. But as agonizingly slowly and steadily. I mean, you’ve got you’re job, whatever it may be — reports to file, orders to fill, goods to deliver, deadlines to meet. You have your commitments to your friends and family, all those birthday parties to plan and school lunches to pack. And you have your own personal setbacks and goals to contend with, that wonky knee you need to see a doctor about, the treadmill waiting for you at the gym if you can work up the ambition, bills to pay, a novel you always meant to write. And maybe you’re on top of it all and maybe you’re not, but you’ve got those yellow blinkers on and you’re working on it. But then you step back for a moment and take a look around. Pick a collection of headlines or news items. In a 24-hour digital news environment, with notifications pushed to your mobile phone and scrolling through your social media feeds and ticking across the bottom of your television screen, it all gets you stuck. It can seem like the mains are bursting, the puddles are gathering, the ground may be shifting. A combination of corroded infrastructure and natural forces and human failures. A great sinkhole of muck that may suck us all under. It can feel like that, even if it hasn’t swallowed most of us up. Yet. Like the TTC supervisor in question, who got back to work immediately to finish his shift, uninjured, if frightened.  Can you relate?  ",0,These days it’s easy to relate to the TTC’s sinking vehicle
"Like many Torontonians in search of a home, Katy Schuyler would do almost anything to secure a coveted one-bedroom apartment downtown. Nevertheless, she doesn’t think handing over a record of her last 30 bank transactions should be part of the deal. “I don’t even bother scheduling appointments with places like that because that’s beyond intrusive,” Schuyler said. “You don’t need to see what I spend my money on.” Schuyler joins a growing number of people in the GTA concerned about landlords asking for too much personal information as they hunt for affordable housing in a red-hot real-estate market. There’s been a sharp rise in the number of public complaints about landlord and tenant issues made to Canada’s privacy commissioner. In 2012, the commissioner recorded nine of them across the country. In 2017, that number shot up to 48. In the GTA they’re also up, from six complaints to 20 over the same period.  Landlord and tenant issues are also commanding a larger proportion of the commission’s time. In 2012, they made up just four per cent of all complaints accepted for investigation in the GTA, but that number rose to 13 per cent as of last year. The “majority of recent complaints,” spokesperson Tobi Cohen wrote in an email, were about “use and disclosure of personal information and consent.” Those include “allegations that a landlord or property manager disclosed personal information to other tenants, other property managers, realtors etc.; complaints related to the collection of information such as driver’s licences and social insurance numbers for rental applications; and the use of video surveillance cameras,” she said. In response to the increase, the commissioner   It outlines what landlords are entitled to ask for and clarifies their responsibilities under federal privacy legislation, which includes obtaining consent to collect private information and ensuring the information is protected. Geordie Dent, executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants’ Associations, said the rise in complaints “almost lines up perfectly” with a dip in the GTA rental vacancy rate, which means there’s lots of competition for the few apartments available. It’s now 1.1 per cent for the GTA, according to  ., and 1 per cent for the   (CMA). “Landlords are just asking for more and more information because they know if you won’t provide it to them, there’s 10 people lined up that will,” Dent said. As a tenant advocate, he’s heard a “huge laundry list” of “very intrusive questions” being asked by landlords, including mental-health history, family status, psychological surveys and, most commonly, social insurance numbers. “When you’re handing over your SIN, you don’t know what it’s being used for or where it’s going,” he said. “That’s a real major concern for a lot of people.” Dent feels better enforcement of existing privacy laws, culminating in either fines for landlords or compensation for tenants, would help. “Unless there’s some kind of penalty for breaking the law, the landlord’s going to do it anyways,” he said.  recommend tenants do not provide their SINs to landlords but note there’s no law preventing landlords from asking. Once a landlord has collected such personal information, they’re bound by privacy legislation to protect it. Former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian called the collection of data on tenants and aspiring tenants “terrible” and said it puts them at risk of identity theft. “I would be very concerned about this in terms of all the personal information they’re collecting from potential renters, and who knows how long they retain that information,” Cavoukian said. While she acknowledges aspiring renters are “between a rock and hard place,” she encourages them to ask landlords to delete their information once the apartment search is over. It’s also important to warn landlords about the “unintended consequences” of collecting data and remind them they’re on the hook in case of a data breach, she added. “If these landlords are collecting all this sensitive information, theoretically if someone could perpetrate identify theft, it doesn’t need to be the landlord himself; it could be someone in the landlord’s office,” Cavoukian said. “You just never know.” ",0,Complaints about nosy landlords on the rise
"WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump offered a partial denial in public but privately defended his extraordinary remarks disparaging Haitians and African countries. Trump said he was only expressing what many people think but won’t say about immigrants from economically depressed countries, according to a person who spoke to the president as criticism of his comments ricocheted around the globe. Trump spent Thursday evening calling friends and outside advisers to judge their reaction, said the confidant, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to disclose a private conversation. Trump wasn’t apologetic about the inflammatory remarks and denied he was racist, instead, blaming the media for distorting his meaning, the confidant said. Critics of the president, including some Republicans, on Friday blasted the vulgar comments made in the Oval Office. In a meeting with a group of senators, Trump had questioned why the U.S. would accept more immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” in Africa as he rejected a bipartisan immigration deal, according to one participant and people briefed on the remarkable conversation. The comments revived charges that Trump is racist and roiled already tenuous immigration talks that included discussion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. “The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,” Trump insisted in early tweets Friday, pushing back on some depictions of the meeting. But Trump and his advisers notably did not dispute the most controversial of his remarks: using “shithole” to describe African nations and saying he would prefer immigrants from countries like Norway instead. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the only Democrat in the room, said Trump had indeed said what he was reported to have said. The remarks, Durbin said, were “vile, hate-filled and clearly racial in their content.” He said Trump used the most vulgar term “more than once.” “If that’s not racism, I don’t know how you can define it,” Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told WPLG-TV in Miami. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said the comments were “beneath the dignity of the presidency” and Trump’s desire for more immigrants from countries like Norway was “an effort to set this country back generations by promoting a homogenous, white society.” Republican leaders were largely silent, though House Speaker Paul Ryan said the vulgar language was “very unfortunate, unhelpful.” Trump’s insults — along with his rejection of the bipartisan immigration deal drafted by six senators — also threatened to further complicate efforts to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, many of whom were brought to the country as children and now are here illegally. Trump last year ended DACA, which provided young immigrants with protection from deportation along with the ability to work legally in the U.S. He gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative fix. The three Democratic and three GOP senators who’d struck the deal Trump rejected had been working for months on how to balance those protections with Trump’s demands for border security, an end to a visa lottery aimed at increasing immigrant diversity, and limits to immigrants’ ability to sponsor family members to join them in America. On Saturday, Trump sought to blame “all talk and no action” Democrats for lack of an immigration deal. “I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!” Trump tweeted from Florida as he arrived at his private golf club in West Palm Beach. One of the six senators who crafted the bipartisan deal, Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado, said Saturday that the proposal “has everything the president asked for on the border.” He said if Trump can’t support it, “it’s difficult to see how we could get him to agree to anything that could pass in Congress.” It was unclear now how a deal might emerge, though both sides insist the clock is ticking. Failure could impact government operations. Lawmakers have until Jan. 19 to approve a short-term government spending bill, and Republicans will need Democratic votes to push the measure through. Some Democrats have threatened to withhold support unless an immigration pact is forged. Trump’s comments came as Durbin was presenting details of the compromise plan that included providing $1.6 billion for a first instalment on the president’s long-sought border wall. Trump took particular issue with the idea that people who’d fled to the U.S. after disasters in places such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti would be allowed to stay as part of the deal, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly describe the discussion. When it came to talk of extending protections for Haitians, Durbin said Trump replied: “We don’t need more Haitians.’” “He said: ‘Put me down for wanting more Europeans to come to this country. Why don’t we get more people from Norway?’” Durbin told reporters in Chicago. The administration announced last year that it would end a temporary residency permit program that allowed nearly 60,000 Haitians to live and work in the U.S. following a devastating 2010 earthquake. Trump insisted Friday that he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said ‘take them out.’ Made up by Dems.” Trump wrote, “I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings — unfortunately, no trust!” Trump ignored shouted questions about his comments as he signed a proclamation Friday honouring Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which is Monday. Sens. David Perdue and Tom Cotton who attended Thursday’s meeting, issued a statement saying they “do not recall the president saying these comments specifically.” What Trump did do, they said, was “call out the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest.” But Sen. Lindsey Graham said by Durbin to have voiced objection to Trump’s comments during the meeting, issued a statement that did not dispute the remarks. “Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,” Graham said, adding: “I’ve always believed that America is an idea, not defined by its people but by its ideals.”  ",0,"Trump partly denies, but also defends controversial immigrant remarks "

Atkinson. As a child, he knew of poverty first-hand as he was the youngest of eight children growing up in a single-parent family after his father was killed in a work-related accident. When he became publisher of the Toronto Star, he appealed to Star readers in 1901 to help children of the poor escape the sweltering city heat during one of the worst summer heat waves on record by providing funds for picnics and excursions. Today, the charity is known as The Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund. Later, in 1906, he again reached out to Star readers to contribute to provide gifts for children of the poor to ensure that no child would be without a gift at Christmas. This charity became The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund. Star readers responded generously at that time and have done so every year for more than a century. The Fund’s mission is to provide underprivileged children with a gift at Christmas. Established in 1906, The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund is one of Toronto’s oldest charities in existence. Since its inception, the Toronto Star newspaper has continued to pay for the administrative expenses related to the Fund. The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund supports children from financially struggling families, age newborn to 12, with a gift box at Christmas. The children must reside within Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Ajax or Pickering to receive the gift box. The Toronto Star continues to pay for administrative costs allowing donor dollars to be directed toward the gift box preparation. The fundraising goal has changed over the years to meet the demand. The current goal is to raise in excess of $1.7 million to purchase merchandise for 45,000 gift boxes. Each child receives a colourful gift box containing a warm shirt, hat, mittens, socks, small toy, book, candy and dental hygiene items. All items are age appropriate and gender neutral. The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund accepts donations throughout the year, but the actual fundraising campaign timeline is from late October to Christmas Eve each year. Unfortunately, we cannot accept donated items. We must ensure we treat each of the 45,000 children equitably. All merchandise must be ordered at the beginning of each year, according to the quantities we require per age, starting from newborn up to age 12. We also ensure all items fit into the standard-sized box, are size appropriate and gender neutral. Our Fund strongly believes all children should be treated equally and fairly.

"In 1901 Toronto was hit by one of the worst heat waves on record. With thermometers topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the wealthy and middle class shaded themselves on verandas. But the poor, living in squalor and sleeping in stuffy bedrooms that reeked of foul street air, had no reprieve. Sadly, many died from the brutal heat that summer. On just one July day, 28 people died of heat-related symptoms, including 12 babies. One steamy June day that year, Joseph Atkinson, publisher of The Daily Star, set out on a stroll through sizzling neighbourhoods in the city. As he walked through the east end, he could not believe the sad view of youngsters playing in the scorching sun outside the wretched shacks they called home, simply trying to take their minds off the heat. Atkinson knew of childhood poverty first-hand. When he was an infant, his father was killed in a tragic accident, leaving his widowed mother alone to raise eight small children. As an adult, with a more prosperous life as publisher of The Daily Star, Atkinson felt compelled to help relieve the agony facing many children of Toronto’s poor and downtrodden. From such humble beginnings, The Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund was born. Atkinson began publishing stories in the newspaper to raise awareness about the squalor and need for the community to help the poor. These stories helped raise money to allow underprivileged and special needs children to enjoy a reprieve from the city’s sweltering heat. He used his power and influence to briefly remove poor and ill children from their day-to-day despair to experience a new environment of clean air, clean water, healthy food and fun in the countryside. That first year, $1025.50 was raised to send 26 children to a Whitby farm. Other children enjoyed picnics, boat cruises on Lake Ontario and free rides around Toronto on the old Belt Line railway. As the years progressed, the Fund grew and children were sent to day camps throughout the city or enjoyed time away in the northern areas now considered cottage country. More than one century later, The   continues Atkinson’s mission to enable children to escape the sweltering summer heat and the harsh realities of life – even for a week. These camp experiences help develop and benefit a child’s emotional, mental and physical well-being. But even more, it is a wonderful chance for all children, regardless of privilege or need, to simply be children, to laugh, to play, to learn and to build lifelong friendships and memories. Help us build on this century-old tradition and send 25,000 children to camp this year!   to find out more about what we do or here to  . To learn more about Joseph Atkinson,  .

"The Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund raises money from the public and provides grants to registered camps to subsidize families who cannot afford the regular camp fees. The Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund does not operate its own camp. The Fund does not finance operational camp expenses nor do we accept applications from families directly. To find the most appropriate camp for your child, first decide if your child is ready to attend a day or residential camp. A day camp typically operates Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm and the child returns home at the end of the day. A residential camp offers a sleepover away from home for one week or more. You should ensure the camp has the facilities to accommodate your child’s special requirements (i.e. medical needs, behavioral issues, etc.). There are numerous camps offering services for children with special needs. You may visit the following websites for detailed camp information. The Ontario Camping Association is a referral agency that recognizes camps for standards, safety and care. You can contact them by calling 416-485-0425 or visit the website at  . You can also refer to the Canada Camps for Parents magazine. This publication is usually distributed, free of charge, through the Toronto Star newspaper in January. You can also contact the publication at 905-370-0736 or visit the website to review their camp listing, at:  . Once you have chosen an appropriate camp that meets the needs of your child, contact the camp directly and inquire about session availability. It is best to contact the camp as early in the year as possible. Many camps have waiting lists. If you require financial assistance, ask if the camp offers subsidies to help pay for the camp fees. Be prepared to provide personal financial information to the camp as it must assess the amount of financial support you will receive. The camp may ask about your monthly income including: wages after tax, if you are receiving social assistance and child support. The camp may also inquire about your monthly expenses including: rent, utilities, day care, food, transportation, clothing, etc. ",0,Tips to locate an appropriate camp for your child

"A few weeks ago, I went back to Algonquin Park to camp for the first time since I was a teenager. Five couples and seven kids — all under the age of 6 — piled into canoes and paddled across Rock Lake to a gorgeous island campsite sheltered by towering pines and carpeted by orange needles. We saw a bull moose grazing in the reeds, a heron fishing in the mud, chipmunks and red squirrels and more frogs than you could catch. It was a nostalgic weekend for everyone, reliving our childhood camping excursions and creating new memories for our kids. Sure, some things were different — there was a fire ban and we had to cook all our meals on camping stoves — but the experience of spending time in nature never changes. The smell of wet cedar, the feeling of sand between your toes, the tingling of the sun on your shoulders. Words don’t suffice. There’s something indescribable about the woods. And that’s something everyone should have a chance to experience. Algonquin is only three hours away, but it seems farther than the moon for many kids in Toronto. That’s why the Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund is such an important cause, and one that readers have rallied around for more than 100 years. Since 1901, hundreds of thousands of kids from families that might not own a car, or a sleeping bag, have been given the opportunity to escape the city and spend a few days at summer camp.  Swimming, canoeing and hiking shouldn’t be luxuries. Thanks to your contributions this year, the Fresh Air Fund has met its fundraising goal of $650,000 and 25,000 more kids will be able to do these things — some of them for the first time — this summer. As of Friday, we’ve raised $676,990. “I’m thrilled to know that the Star’s readers have stepped forward again this year to help ensure that so many children can have the time of their lives this summer at camp. It says a lot about the quality of our community, which has so generously provided a gift that will keep on giving long after camp ends,” said John Boynton, publisher of the Star and CEO of its parent company, Torstar. We’re lucky to live in Canada for so many reasons. Our amazing education and health care systems; our open and welcoming multicultural society; our prosperous economy that provides opportunity and material well being for so many. But we also have the land. I lived and worked overseas for many years and was struck by how spoiled we are in Canada with quick access to relatively undisturbed nature. There simply aren’t the same expanses of wilderness in Europe. Even in Africa, it’s hard to get away from roads, garbage and other signs of civilization. But in Canada there are majestic expanses of pristine nature just a short drive from the heart of our biggest urban centre. You don’t have to fly to the Yukon or paddle into the woods for a week to be surrounded by the sounds and smells of the wild. They’re right at our doorstep. And an increasing number of scientific studies show that spending time in nature has measurable health benefits for kids.  Cam Collyer, executive director of programming at the charity  , says parents and educators are becoming increasingly concerned with the effects that modern lifestyles are having on kids, who spend more time closely supervised, indoors and on screens. “Research shows that time in nature provides a counterbalance to this,” he said. “Contact with nature has positive effects on everything from the immune system to eyesight. There are also more subtle changes to brain development, memory and attention.” Instead of spending their summers glued to their smartphones, kids who unplug and reconnect with the natural world are recharging their mental batteries, Collyer said.  “There’s some good research that has been exploring attention restoration,” he said.  When a child is in a natural environment, where there are a lot of things going on — wind in the trees, sounds and noise — they have a more dispersed, soft focus. This is in contrast to the hard focus that’s needed when you’re performing a task, or sitting in a classroom and listening to a teacher.  “Time in nature, because you have a softer focus, is very calming for the mind and restorative. You’re essentially filling the tank for focused attention,” said Collyer. In other words, sending kids to camp is good for them. It’s something people have always suspected, but now we know it to be true. Without a doubt, I’m grateful for the time I spent camping as a kid and I can’t think of a better present for any child. The gift of campfires, stargazing and serenity — the kind that can only be found in the woods.  Thank you for making this possible, once again, for so many children in our city.

"Founded in 1901 by Star publisher Joseph Atkinson, The Fresh Air Fund has raised millions of dollars and provided more than a half-million children with a memorable summer holiday they may have otherwise never experienced. Each year, more than 25,000 children attend over 100 different day and residential camps as the result of contributions from thousands of generous individuals, organizations and businesses. Many of the campers are from disadvantaged and single parent families. A significant number of campers are also children with special needs, medical conditions or who are confined to hospitals and other facilities. The Fresh Air Fund summer experience helps them build self-esteem and social skills in a safe, fun and nurturing environment. Today, just as it was in 1901, it is important for children to get away from the harsh realities and responsibilities of life - even for one week. This period of time is crucial to help increase, develop and benefit a child's emotional, mental and physical well-being. It is a wonderful chance for children to simply be children … to laugh … to play … to learn … to build lifelong friendships and memories. The fundraising goal is $650,000. The money donated toward this goal is directed to subsidizing camp fees for children who cannot afford to attend summer camp. During the summer campaign, daily stories will be featured in the Toronto Star and online about the children who benefit from this campaign and the camps who serve them. All donors receive a tax receipt for income tax purposes in the fall. Acknowledgement cards are available upon request by calling 416-869-4847. All contributions are published in the newspaper, options available as follows: Example 1: In memory of Mrs. Smith; Example 2: Anonymous; Example 3: In lieu of gift to clients of ABC Co.

"On a hot summer afternoon, on a make-believe stage at Mount Pleasant Road Baptist Church in midtown, April, 9, whips off her shoe, and thrusts a pink-socked foot high in the air towards Taylor, 10, who is sitting in the chair beside her. In a high-pitched, nasal voice, April introduces Taylor to her “best friends” — her toes.  “This is Frida, Mimi, Kuku, Moomoo, Titi,” says April, lingering for a moment on each digit, before kicking off her other shoe, and completing the introductions. “This is Kuvu, Tuku, Moomoo, Kutu and Bubu.” Then she transforms into a cat, and starts meowing at Taylor, who reacts with disgust, and takes her leave.  April’s antics solicit raucous laughter from the crowd, a dozen or so kids seated in a semicircle around the pair of chairs, which, for the purposes of this improv game, represent a park bench. The scene always starts the same way: One person is sitting on the “bench,” minding their own business. That peace is disrupted when a second person sits down beside them, and adopts a weird, gross or creepy character — whatever it takes to prompt the other person to walk away. It’s the first day of camp at the  , which runs classes and weeklong day programs at more than 30 locations — churches, community centres and schools — across the GTA and southwestern Ontario, from London to Oshawa. The camp, which offers funding to low-income families and accommodates children with special needs, serves a broad cross-section of the community with support from the  . Artistic director Lily Small, who founded the non-profit organization with her husband, Charles Small, in Dundas, Ont., in 1994, said the program grew through an “organic process” that started after the pair put on their first play,  .  “It was so popular,” she recalls. “People asked us, ‘Can you teach me? Can you put on another play?’”  This summer, roughly 1,400 children and preschoolers will participate in the programs, which aim to build confidence, communication skills and teach various aspects of theatre production, including acting, wardrobe and set design.    Interest in theatre is not a prerequisite for campers, but it seems to be a common trait among April, Taylor and their fellow campers at the midtown Toronto site. “I just wanted to act,” says Liam, 11, when asked why he signed up.  “I really love acting,” interjects Jack, 12. “My mom and dad and all friends said I should get into acting.” If they were nervous on Day One, it wasn’t obvious. Shortly after meeting each other, they jumped into icebreakers and drama games and got to work on the week’s primary task: Putting on a play. On Friday afternoon, the children will perform for their parents.  After being divided into two groups based on age, they chose scripts — the juniors selected   and the intermediates opted for   — and got their roles. By the afternoon, they already running lines.  Lily Small, who spent Monday hustling between camp sites, said the transformation she sees in the kids over the course of the week is “amazing.” “Sometimes you talk to them on Friday and as if they’ve been there the whole year. They’ve gotten to know their friends and the counsellors have gotten to know them,” she said. “There’s a lot of camaraderie. They feel like they own the world at the end of it.”  ",0,Kids at theatre camp ‘feel like they own the world’
"A welcome midday dump of rain has brought brief relief from a scorching stretch of summertime weather at Camp Kirk, and the six boys of Cabin 4 are splayed out on their bunks, spending their post-lunch quiet hour plotting. It’s the birthday of one of their counsellors. “Big” Ben Gray has just turned 26, and the boys need to lure him away after dinner for a special surprise, perhaps a trip to town for ice cream. How about saying Hunter fell in the toilet? Ben, it is agreed, would definitely want to see that. Or, how about the promise of a “long boring walk” or fishing? No, it should be a kidnapping, with the campers wearing disguises and spiriting Ben out of the dining hall and into waiting camp vehicles, says Liam Littell, 14, a return camper from Arizona. Another camper pipes up: “I think what we should actually do, though, is get chloroform or something that makes you sleep and actually proper kidnap him and then we wake him up wherever we are, and he’s like, ‘What?’ ” At that, Avery VanGenechten, 13, a camper from Oshawa who conquered a climb of the hardest section of the rock wall in the morning and is now tucked into  , gazes up from his book. Saner heads will prevail, and the plot will go down later that night — without the use of chemicals — at  , a residential camp near the village of Kirkfield in the Kawarthas, which offers kids with varying types and degrees of learning disabilities a chance to enjoy the wilds of Ontario, for 10 days to two weeks.  On this week in mid-July, it’s all boys, ranging in age from around 9 to 15. Four days into their two-week session, strong bonds between themselves and staff have already formed. Avery and Jake “Waffles” Reilly, 13, of Richmond Hill, had both been to the camp before, but this is the first time they’ve been in the same session. Both assigned to Cabin 4, they’ve become pals, spending quiet time on side-by-side swings, chatting. Later, after dinner and before the kidnapping of Ben, the 30-some campers, plus leaders and counsellors-in-training and staff, will engage in an old camp tradition of jumping up on their chairs and bellowing out John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” ... “to a place where I belong.” For the returning campers, it is like coming home.  “It’s a very open, very kid-friendly camp, where over the course of the session you really become a family, particularly for special-needs kids,” says Logan Littell, 16, Liam’s older brother, who is in his fifth year at camp and a leader-in-training. “The counsellors and other staff really make sure that the special-needs kids get what they need and really help them get through tough times,” says Logan. “They are absolutely amazing and when you’re feeling down they definitely try and help get you back up on your feet and they definitely try their best to keep you engaged, to have a good time here at camp.” Good times include cooling off in the swimming pool, pottery making, hugging Henry, the camp director’s dog, catching and releasing painted turtles in the swamp, beach days at Balsam Lake Provincial Park, music sessions, and braving a go at the “Bucky Swing” — a towering, gut-wrenching challenge that involves being clipped into a harness, pulled to a great height and released to soar over lush greenery. Bucky, if you must know, is the beaver who lives in the swamp, along with the leeches, including ones named “Skinny Boy” and “The Blob.” Back home, says Logan, he is not fully accepted in school. “But here you’re accepted for whoever you are. At some points, you kind of get bullied or just kind of left out at school, but here, you’re never left out.” Kids and teens aged 6 to 16 are eligible to attend camp. The staff-to-camper ratio is high, usually 32 to 36. The camp focuses on individual strengths, not differences, something that is evident over the course of a day. The highlight for many campers are the extended canoe trips into the Haliburton Highlands and Algonquin Park.  Before the kidnapping of Ben, the boys of Cabin 4 spent the afternoon learning how to paddle and rescue a tipped canoe, albeit on land, due to a storm outside. They learned that a paddle is not a lightsaber, nor is it an axe. And that the camper in the “princess seat” — the middle of the canoe — must not be a princess, and must paddle. The next day, after the kidnapping, the boys of Cabin 4 head off on a three-day canoe trip, making memories that will last a lifetime.  You can help make those memories possible   to the Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund. ",0,Fresh Air Fund: Camp Kirk’s Cabin 4 plots a catch and release
"Daniel Rothenstein, 11, swipes a paintbrush down the length of a rectangular wooden box before sitting back to contemplate his next move.  He scans his arts and crafts project for imperfections, but doesn’t lose focus despite the banter and chuckling from fellow preteens also immersed in painting their own boxes. It’s a scene you’d expect at any summer camp. But rather than a bird feeder or a simple stool, these kids are putting the finishing touches on their Shabbat lamps, devices outfitted with LED lights that don’t force the user to turn electricity on or off during the Sabbath. That’s when orthodox Jews can’t turn on power sources or flip switches for about 24 hours. The project, devised by Rabbi Shloma Chayn, is a subtle nod to how camp Segula is a bit different.  “I don’t think there’s any camp that does anything like this,” says Chayn, Segula’s founder and director. “We are unique in many ways.”  Catering to Orthodox Jewish boys between 11 and 14 years old, this Thornhill day camp tries to relate some summer activities to Judaism and foster an environment that’s, first and foremost, fun. It offers kosher food, for instance, and sneaks in about 45 minutes of bible study between activities like cartooning, guitar and drum lessons, and special trips including a day of treetop trecking in Barrie, Ont., and an overnight in Niagara Falls.  Of course, it wouldn’t be camp without lots and lots of sports. The boys spend a large part of their day playing basketball, football, hockey, soccer and swimming, Chayn says. Camper Moshe Baturi, 11, says being at Segula is a “mitzvah,” meaning a good thing to do, because “we get to play fun sports” and also learn about the bible. That’s music to Chayn’s ears.  As a rabbi who has long served Toronto’s Orthodox Jewish community, he started the camp close to 40 years ago, he says, when he noticed that kids around 11 years old got tired of going to camps that cater to younger children. He also noticed that when they didn’t have a daily summertime outlet, or if their families couldn’t afford to send them to overnight camps, part of the local, Jewish fabric, the kids were “wandering around without a structure.”  “Where would they go?” he says, recently reflecting on the history of his day camp. “I filled the vacuum and it grew.” Chayn offers deep subsidies to families who can’t afford to send their kids to camp, even allowing some in for free, he says, and that’s why the Star’s Fresh Air Fund has been pivotal to Segula’s existence.  This year, about 60 campers fill a gymnasium and three classrooms at a Thornhill public school. On a recent afternoon, a group of kids learn guitar or shoot hoops while others pour over sketch pads. Azi Neger, 13, balances one on his knee, pencil poised over the contours of an action figure he’s drawing. “Where’s my eraser?” he says, scanning his desk and those of his fellow, budding cartoonists. Neger barely notices that the teacher Yehuda Lang, also the national art director for the Jewish National Fund, is standing over a white board and leading this tiny group of preteens through the drawing of a robot with giant arms, and some squiggly features. “They’re very good,” he says of his camper-students. “It’s humbling.” A room away, Eldan Cohen, a music teacher, strums a guitar and sings a song with no words called “Elul Nigun”, a popular melody in the Orthodox Jewish community, while an 11-year-old camper figures out the beat, striking the snare drum and crash symbol, not to mention pumping the bass drum’s kick peddle with the confidence of a seasoned drummer. “This is our third time together!” Cohen says, above the thump-crashing, enthused about his campers and how quickly they’ve learned to play. He turns his attention back to the camper at the drum set. “Get ready for a crash cymbal!” Cohen says. In the gymnasium, groups of boys who just finished lunch at the tables on the stage, jockey to snag a basketball.  Yitzchak Rose, 13, reclines in a chair on the stage, taking in all the action. If he wasn’t at camp what would he be doing? “Sleeping and playing on my phone,” he says, conceding that camp is better.  Back in the classroom where campers are making the Shabbat lamps, Chayn walks around wearing latex gloves and filling paper plates with paint. Rothenstein is finishing his project.  “I read a lot, so this is going to be very helpful,” he says. “It doesn’t just have to be for Shabbat. All my lights are way too bright to use under my covers, so I could keep this, like, a little bit open and I’ll be able to read without my parents finding out.” ",0,Thornhill’s Camp Segula integrates Orthodox-Judaism into its activities
"Lindsay Lohan, the Christmas Grinch, the Guardians of the Galaxy and rampaging dinosaurs would make a very strange combination for a movie.  At summer camp, however, the combo is as natural as clear air and cold lake water, if you’re talking about the movies that kids like to view under the stars. Kids go to camp to get away from the routines and cares of the big city. The Toronto Star’s  , through generous contributions from readers, supports 102 overnight and day camps to give children a chance to experience the wonders of the natural world.  Sometimes, though, campers just want to kick back and watch a good movie. And the selection can be as eclectic as the flowers and wildlife that surround them. At all-girls Marygrove Camp in Tiny Township, on the shores of Georgian Bay, the cinema fun begins even before the 1,150 annual summer revellers arrive at the facilities sponsored by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Campers all ride together on four buses, says Marygrove director Louise Coutu, and they carry with them a camp registration bag that includes not only important documents, but also a selection of favourite movies, as chosen by campers over many years. There are multiple copies of each film. “The No. 1 favourite is    , the Lindsay Lohan edition,” Coutu says. “We play it on the bus on the way up to camp; it gets everyone in the mood for the adventure ahead. It is a camp classic and holds everyone’s attention from start to finish. “Another bus favourite is  , with Steve Martin. The family (in the film) rent a cottage that reminds us all of the great times ahead on Georgian Bay.  “And always in the top three is Jim Carrey’s  . We celebrate Christmas in July, so that is how it started being included in the ‘camp bag.’ The fast-paced action and hilarious lines — ‘Blast this Christmas Music, it’s joyful and triumphant!’— always gets the girls giggling and the staff love the lines. Why save a great favourite until Christmas? It’s always great to see a heart grow three times in one day — isn’t that what we all need?” is also a favourite for participants at LOVE National Leadership Camp, a summer retreat for at-risk youth operating out of Camp Kinkora in Saint-Adolphe-d’Howard, Quebec. It’s run by Leave Out Violence (LOVE) Ontario, a youth advocacy organization. The camp has the tradition of holding a movie night on the third day, says Dena Henry, program manager for LOVE Ontario. “Last year’s movie was  ,” she says. “We played   on the bus on the way there, but most of the youths just watch their individual movies on Netflix, since the bus has wifi.” Other LOVE Camp favourites are  , and (“A personal favourite — not sure how the youth feel about this one,” Henry says).  And the LOVE crew can’t go wrong with “anything that is new or from Marvel Comics,” she adds. But, for obvious reasons, they try to steer clear of camp-themed horror movies, such as  . At the Bob Rumball Camp of the Deaf in Parry Sound, the campers don’t just watch movies; they act out parts from them. Popular movies include ,  and . “Clips from movies are used to support the (camp) program,” says camp director Derek Rumball. “For example, today is Jurassic Camp themed day. So last evening, for a teaser for today, we showed selective clips that would support the activities today.” Camp staff also get involved in the fun of playing famous movie characters. “We may have a Luke Skywalker, or characters from  . We have ‘go to’ clips that support themes of the program, so our favourite movies change from year to year.” Seems that sci-fi is very popular at the camp. However, when I asked Rumball what a classic camp-themed movie would be for his group, he replied  and  , where not a spaceship nor lightsaber is in sight The latter film is a Canadian classic, directed by Ivan Reitman and featuring an early starring role for Bill Murray.

And may watch it over a couple of nights. Action sports adventure, extreme sports are always a favourite.” . ",0,Summer camp movie nights: the tradition continues
"The campers had finished irrigating the flowers and were returning their brightly coloured watering cans to the kiddie-pool-sized water barrel when a rabbit bounded into view, zigged across the soft earth and made a beeline for the shrubs.  “There is a bunny,” several kids cried, before giving chase. The bunny was not touched. It was a bit startled, but given complete freedom to hop off. Counsellor Nomi Walsh, or “Worm” as she is known at camp, immediately started asking the group questions about what the bunny looked like and where the kids thought it was going.  “The rabbit was hiding in one of the bushes and then it climbed up and it was grey, white and the tail was black and white,” said Marcus Perez, 8, recalling the action for the Star immediately after the Monday morning encounter at Evergreen Brick Works, on Bayview Ave. The bunny was also brown in parts, he explained.  “And it started running into the bushes over there and up into the tree. So when you come close to it, it starts running away from you,” Marcus said. Marcus, or “Timberwolf” as he is called at camp, is in his third year at Evergreen Adventure Camp. Everybody, from kids to counsellors picks nature names. Marcus loves wolves so Timberwolf was an obvious fit.  The weeklong camp is in its ninth summer and is open for kids as young as 6 and youth up to 15. About 120 campers attend each week, during one of nine weekly sessions in total, including boys and girls sponsored through the Star’s Fresh Air Fund. “Ideally they wouldn’t have chased the bunny, but it’s good that they spotted it,” said counsellor Walsh, who planned to research the rabbit during lunch hour, hopefully finding some books with photos so she could share more with her pack.  The days are packed with activities designed to get kids away from their computer screens and rigid schedules and engaged with the natural world. Marcus’s group watered plants, played a version of tag that involved camouflaging in the bushes, had a snack, made time to rehydrate, applied sunscreen and learned to build and safely light a campfire, all before 10:30 a.m.  Cam Collyer, executive director of programs, said they strive to give kids a sense of adventure, a connection to nature and to throw them off their schedules, immersing them in naturally and inherently wild or fluid experiences. The bunny breaking up the morning activities, he agreed, was a good example of things going offside in a very positive direction.  “We are right in the city. We are right in their home terrain. They are discovering things they can actually return to,” said Collyer, also known as “Moss.”  Blending kids from all corners of Toronto, of all backgrounds and levels of income, creates a social diversity that is reflective of the actual city and provides a more meaningful learning experience for all involved, he said.  “It is a very physical program too, so kids are lifting, holding and making, working with their hands. The program gives different kids a chance to shine.” One of the morning lessons was how to safely light a campfire, led by Georgia Koumantaros, or “Sumac.” Everybody was instructed on building a fire, stacking kindling like a tiny log cabin, how fire needs oxygen, how to avoid getting smoke in your eyes and making sure you don’t get burned. All of the kids got to light a wooden match, tossing it towards the pile of wood inside a deep pit, ringed by large flat stones.  Among the campers were Ruby Sims and Willow Schelter, “Cardinal” and “Panda” respectively, both 7. The girls had helped start fires before and agreed that successfully lighting a match required pressing really hard.  “I pressed really hard my first time, but it didn’t really work, so I did it again and it was really good,” said Willow, who after her second swipe tossed her lit match high and a bit wild into the fire pit.  Ruby’s first match ignited and she managed to throw it directly on top of the kindling, where it stuck. “I found you had to push really, really hard. But when you are dropping it you have to be quick,” she said.  This was their second summer at camp and their first year being friends.  Both paid keen attention to the discussion around fire safety, with Willow explaining quietly that if smoke gets in your eyes you need to turn and calmly walk away.  Ruby stuck up her hand and responded to a question from her counsellor, explaining to the group why you shouldn’t sit on the edge of a fire pit or get too close to the flames.  “It would be really hot,” she said.  The Star’s Fresh Air Fund has been raising money to send kids to summer camp since 1901. The fund aims to raise $650,000 to send 25,000 kids to a range of   this summer.

"You can be silent but have a lot to say, and nowhere is that more evident than at the Sign Language Summer Program day camp.  Every summer, since 1974, kids aged 6 to 14 who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have siblings and parents with or without hearing challenges of their own, have been part of a unique seasonal gathering. Campers learn and hone their skills communicating in American Sign Language (ASL), the standard English language signing system used in much of Canada, the U.S., and parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia, and they get to enjoy sport activities, swimming, arts and crafts, and group day trips to places like the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada’s Wonderland, the Ontario Science Centre and other popular attractions. But most important, they get to meet a lot of new friends. About 80 kids from a variety of cultural backgrounds and different education levels are enrolled in this summer’s SLSP day camp, which is organized and supervised by  , a Catholic Charities agency supported by ShareLife along with sponsors like the Toronto Star’s Fresh Air Fund. Running from July 3 until Aug. 17 at Dallington Public School, in North York’s Sheppard Ave. E. and Don Mills Rd. area, the camp has about 20 deaf and ASL fluent staff members, some former day campers who have returned to mentor kids just like they once were: eager to be heard, keen to make friends, learn and have fun. “My favourite things to do at camp are doing crafts and going on field trips to the ROM, like today,” said Kisanet Habtemariam, 11, through a sign language interpreter during a camp excursion to the ROM, where she counted 14 of her pals among her field trip group last Thursday.  Deaf but ASL fluent, Kisanet moved to Toronto from Eritrea a few years ago. It’s her third year at the camp and she’s looking forward to many more. “I want to keep coming, next year, two years from now, three years from now and many after that,” she said, expressing her desire to one day be an adult staffer, as many campers have become over the years. “If she is shy, I help her make friends at the camp,” vowed Kisanet, referring to one of her newest chums, a girl who recently came to Canada from Saudi Arabia. Clearly, it’s an early testament of her urge to befriend and help others.  By her third day at camp, 6-year-old Olena had already voiced her desire to return next summer. She is a member of Silent Voice’s newest program, the Kids of Deaf Adults Camp. Launched three years ago, it is an integrated part of the SLSP’s first two weeks of the camp season. Both of Olena’s parents are deaf and the Etobicoke youngster is remarkably fluent in both ASL and spoken English. It’s her first summer at the camp and she’s wasted no time in getting in on the learning and camaraderie. While she loves playing hide and seek with her dad at home, and is a big fan of basketball, coming to the camp is a new and exciting experience and a place to meet a whole new circle of friends. “I like it because there are lots of friends I know that you don’t make at camp,” said Olena, adding, “I made more friends at camp.” Like many of the camps and organizations generous Star readers support through the Fresh Air Fund, the SLSP day camp relies on fees paid by families who can afford them, yet also provides assistance for many faced with financial restrictions. “While our regular camp fees only account for around 26 per cent of the true cost to run our camp, so far this summer we have 52 per cent of our families requesting subsidy on our camp fees,” said Mike Cyr, Silent Voice Canada’s program director. “We believe in giving priority to the marginalized members of our community.” ",0,Fresh Air Fund: Sign Language Summer Program day camp
"When Bolton Camp was founded by a volunteer social organization nearly 100 years ago, it started on “a prayer and a promise.” Members of the Neighbourhood Workers’ Association didn’t have any money when they found the unused fishing camp on over 36 hectares one hour outside Toronto. But after a few years hosting a children’s camp on borrowed land, the association believed there was a desperate need for a camp that welcomed both children and abandoned or widowed mothers and signed a commitment to buy the property without a penny in the bank. They had, as the Toronto Star reported almost 50 years into the camp’s operation, “the kind of confidence that created miracles.”  Buoyed by support from Star founder and publisher Joseph E. Atkinson, the camp opened in 1922 and hosted 1,004 campers in its first year. It would eventually grow to an over 136-hectare paradise that was heralded as “the prize gem of all camp operations in Canada.”  The Star’s Fresh Air Fund contributed funds to its operation for decades. It was a place where mothers could relax and their children could play outside of the growing and intimidating city metropolis. The camp was a place memories were made, a safe and welcome refuge where countless children marked their childhoods.  Camper Ian Tweyman can attest. He went three years in a row. “I blossomed from camp,” he says now, 60 years after he went. “I went in a really shy, introverted little kid and turned into a people person. ... It was the best thing that ever happened to me.” Tweyman was growing up in Regent Park in the 1950s at the height of recession and widespread unemployment when he started going to camp. His mother was working full-time and supporting three kids on her own. The opportunity to send them out of the city to Bolton was a welcome reprieve. For Tweyman, the hot summer days were spent playing soccer or baseball. There were countless hours spent swimming and the best meals were eaten sitting by an outdoor fireplace. Some memories are more lasting than others. One day he slipped off a ledge and into the deep water of a pool where he nearly drowned. Lifeguards fished him out, but he jumped up and went right back to playing with other kids. There was too much fun to be had and no time for fear when you were at camp. Another day he met actor Johnny Weissmuller, best known for playing Tarzan in films through the 1930s and 1940s, when he paid a visit to meet kids. The camp experience stayed with Tweyman. It became a lifelong love. His son and daughter went to their own camps and eventually became counsellors. His grandchildren are now going too. The experience at Bolton started that tradition. When Tweyman first attended in 1958, there were 100 screened-in cabins, 10 dining rooms and 70 other buildings for recreation. There were three outdoor swimming pools, over 30 outdoor fireplaces and expansive playing fields for team sports and games. Other countless recreational programs included arts and crafts, archery, fishing, music and dramatic arts. It wasn’t too strict. Students were encouraged to choose their own activities. Most of the counsellors were volunteers and more than 60 per cent of campers came from the downtown Toronto area that year. Others came from across Canada, the U.S. and even England. In 1972, director Bob Christensen described the camp as a “lively place” where active youngsters could be released from restraint to whoop, holler, run, jump and climb. The fun grew to be year round. Around 3,000 children studied nature and outdoor survival at Bolton over the fall, winter and summer months in that year. But it all came with a hefty price tag. Operational costs were high. The camp relied on government grants, private donations and contributions from the Star’s Fresh Air Fund to cover operational costs. The food bill alone was $27,000 one year.  There were costly incidents, too. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel smashed into the camp and caused more than $250,000 in damage. Two fires followed in the late 1960s, destroying buildings and costing thousands in damage. In 1968, United Appeal gave $143,000 in help. The Atkinson Charitable Foundation donated $340,000. The Fresh Air Fund also continued to help with annual grants. Through it all, camp operators said no camper was ever refused a holiday. Bolton Camp shut down in 1999 after 75 years in operation. The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority purchased the camp in 2011 and,  , plan to repurpose the property as a cultural hub.

"For more than three decades, Camp Awakening has been inspiring children with physical disabilities to use sports as a way to increase independence and build new skills. This summer, with a new crop of campers filing in, the objective is the same, but with one twist: The camp is hoping to recruit Paralympians to act as instructors and mentors to the kids for a new ParaSport Session in August. “We wanted to create a program that gets the campers more involved with sports ... not only at camp but throughout the rest of the year,” said camp assistant director Kendra Heney.  As the campers — ages 9 to 18 — got ready for a big Canada Day weekend, Heney and interim director Manpal Mangat noted some statistics regarding kids with disabilities. Heney said about 40 per cent of their campers “do not do any physical activities outside of camp.”  With camp running to the end of August, that could mean the campers are active two months of the year; the other 10 months, when they are at home, they could be idle for longer spells during the day, either with no chances to play sports, or even no idea what opportunities are available.  Enter the new ParaSport program at the camp.  The plan is to introduce the campers to a different parasport each day.  The kids will be instructed by a coach with a wide background in parasports, and while the camp is still trying to recruit Paralympians, the kids will get a wide range of sports instruction and chances to participate. “Every day, they (campers) will go over a new sport with their instructor,” Heney said, adding that a former camper will be providing the instruction for the boys.  “There’s going to be a lot of parasports for them ... basketball, tennis, volleyball, sledge hockey,” she said. “In the morning, the coaches will go over the sports, show them how to play, give them drills and other things. In the afternoon, the camp will turn to the traditional, fun things, like canoeing and horseback riding. But in the evening, they’ll go back and play the sport they learned about in the morning.”  The program is divided into a boys camp and a girls camp — seven kids in each — with the boys staged out of Kilcoo Camp in Minden and the girls out of Camp Oconto, near Kingston. “Our campers can make friends with other children with disabilities in the Camp Awakening cabin at those camps, as well as with able-bodied campers at the host camps,” Heney said.  Camp Awakening, now in its 36th year, takes in children with a wide range of disabilities.  The Toronto Star Fresh Air Fund provides funding help for the campers, many of whom come from low-income households.  “A lot of campers would not be able to come to camp without the Star’s Fresh Air Fund,” Mangat said. “It’s a wonderful opportunity for these kids and their families.”  ",0,Kids with disabilities learn a range of parasports at Camp Awakening
"It has become an indelible part of a family’s story, and a reminder that every little bit of money helps kids go to camp as part of the Toronto Star’s Fresh Air Fund.  On July 13, 1968, 7-year-old Hugh Spence put up a stand in front of his home on Griselda Cres. in Scarborough, and sold juice, popcorn, and even some of his old toys and books to raise money for the Fresh Air Fund. With juice going for 2 cents a glass, after two days Spence raised $1.60, which he donated. A photo of Spence pouring out Kool-Aid for a group of young customers appeared in the Star the next day. Reached at his home, Spence, now 57, said it’s a photo he’s pretty familiar with.  “My mom’s got about 10 copies of it. They’ve all started to turn yellow. She cut them out of the newspaper. She still keeps them up at the house,” says Spence. “Whenever she goes through her old things, she’ll start, ‘Oh here, look at you, this is when you became a businessman.’” Spence says his mom went down to the corner store the day the photo appeared and bought a stack of newspapers, carefully cutting out each picture. They’re now a cherished family memory.  Spence says he doesn’t really remember the day and is surprised when the Star tells him he reportedly made $1.60.  “That’s it? Well, I can double that now that I have a job,” jokes Spence, who works as a supervisor with Wheel-Trans at the TTC. Asked why he started fundraising, Spence says it was a way for his parents to teach him how important it was to be helpful to others. “It was a life lesson from my parents to help out others. My dad is a believer in random acts of kindness: if you can do something nice for someone, then you should. My parents have always been like that. My dad got involved with Big Brothers, Meals on Wheels and volunteers. It’s important to get that message out. So sure, I went out to sell a bit of lemonade and popcorn and help a kid afford to go to camp.” It’s a message that can clearly be seen in a 50-year-old picture, but still resonates today.

"The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund was established in 1906 by Toronto Star founder, Joseph E. Atkinson. Atkinson knew of poverty first-hand and recalled his own childhood growing up poor. When he was an infant, his father was killed in a tragic accident. His newly widowed mother struggled with eight small children to feed, clothe, house and raise all alone. It was a very special Christmas in Atkinson’s own childhood that brought out his dedication to help the poor. As young Joseph was watching other children skate one day on a pond, a lady approached and asked him why he was not skating. When she heard his sad tale, she bought him his first pair of skates for Christmas. Atkinson never forgot the warmth and generosity of this stranger who made this Christmas Day the happiest of his childhood. As an adult now living a more prosperous life as publisher of The Daily Star, Atkinson felt compelled to help relieve the agony facing many of Toronto’s poor and downtrodden at the start of the 1890s depression. Atkinson, often reflecting on his own humble beginnings, witnessed the onset of change and used the Toronto Star newspaper to promote a variety of humanitarian and social causes. The city emerged into a decade of incredible growth. In 1901, Canada opened its immigration doors to allow 191,000 workers from the U.K., another 6,000 from Germany followed by 3,000 from Israel and another 1000 from Italy. This influx caused the population to nearly double in the early 1900s. Banking became important; there were 700 manufacturers; middle class neighbourhoods were annexed and immigration soared. Toronto became a metropolis. Housing was inadequate despite a construction boom forcing newcomers to live in wretched conditions. Workers slept on benches – shared by other men from different shifts. This was the beginning of civic activism that sought a better life for all. There was concern for social welfare and a push to have Toronto improve the lot of the city, not just the rich. Planners argued about the city plan of 1905 – should the waterfront be preserved as parkland? Concern was rampant about traffic congestion from the streets crowded with carriages and streetcars bringing workers to the office buildings. People were not happy about a city engineer’s plan to dump waste into Lake Ontario. Public smoking was an issue as were the mosquitoes carrying diseases. Torontonians, a little smug perhaps, were shocked when one of the city’s legendary reformers and medical officer of health, Charles Hastings, produced a damning report on housing for the poor. Hastings campaigned for pasteurized milk, fought to reduce infant mortality, secure fresh water and set up a system of district health offices from which nurses could visit the sick in their homes. Hastings told the Star in 1911, “The people of Toronto have been living in a fool’s paradise. They thought they were free from the slum problem which besets many American cities. Half the world does not know how the other half lives. The truth is that one-half not only does not know, but does not want to know. They do not want their peace of mind disturbed by unpleasant details of the life of sorrows of the working classes”. In his report, he found 198 families – a total of 472 people – living in one-room dwellings. In visits to 4,696 houses, health inspectors found 45 tuberculosis families, 390 houses were absolutely unfit for habitation, 1,348 homes without drains where waste and slop were thrown into yards, walls soaking wet, overflowing outdoor ‘privies’. They found unlit, airless rooms and one where a family of 11 would crowd into three dank rooms with three dogs and chickens. These neighbourhoods contained the largest number of immigrants forced into crowded and unsanitary housing. Hastings chastised greedy landlords who demanded “extortionate rents for miserable hovels”. The worst crowding and exploitation was of immigrant bachelors, who were trying to save money to bring their families to Canada or to return home. The smell of fear grew as did the population. Typhoid, colera, scarlet fever and tuberculosis were often linked to the newly landed immigrants but should have been attributed more to the city’s failure to provide decent accommodations and services or to help control the gouging landlords. Atkinson’s concern for Toronto’s rapid growth and the welfare of its residents was as great as any Torontonian’s concern was. Atkinson, however, had the powerful voice to speak of the issues and could persuade government to implement measures to improve the problems. He also used the paper to encourage readers to help the less privileged. Reflecting on his own impoverished childhood, he also used the paper to tell readers the stories of needy children – the children who were most vulnerable – the children who could not help themselves during these hard times. In 1906, a young Methodist minister alerted Atkinson to the deprivation facing 30 families in York township. One hundred children faced a bleak Christmas – a thought that likely stirred Atkinson’s own childhood memories. Atkinson launched The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund, appealing to readers to ensure no child under age 12 would be without a gift at Christmas. On December 12, 1906 the front page story read “… whatever contributions made may be expended in bringing pleasure to little hearts where pleasure is most seldom felt. There are many hundreds of little folks in this wealthy city, and in this prosperous year, to whom Christmas and Santa Claus are unfortunately meaningless terms.” As many as 300 children received gifts that first year in 1906. The gifts were packed at Trinity Anglican Church and delivered by horse-drawn sleighs to various missions across the city. The next year, 1907, the number of children soared to 1,150 and by 1912, there were 6,000 children receiving gifts. The growth in the Fund reflected the increase in the city’s needy as the Star reported in 1912, “Toronto is paying the penalty of growth in the increasing number of the poor.” Lives and lifestyles did not improve much as many were impacted by the onset of World War I from 1914 to 1918. As time moved forward, the city of Toronto grew by leaps and bounds. As the population grew, so did the need to help financially struggling families make ends meet. And as the need increased, the number of Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund boxes steadily climbed higher. Decade after decade – after decade, right into the new millenium. Each decade presented its own unique impact and effect on various matters both globally and locally. The 1920s, known as the Roaring Twenties or Jazz Age, still suffered with levels of poverty resulting from the American Stock Market Crash of 1929. The 1930s suffered the Great Depression followed by Second World War before the decade ended. The 1940s felt the impact as the Second World War raged on through the decade’s first half and the effects lingered well into the decade’s last half while witnessing beginnings of new technology including computers, jet propulsion and nuclear power. The 1950s saw a recovery from World War II. Known as the prosperous decade and as the Golden Age of Television, this decade had most people rejoicing in the sounds of rock and roll and poodle skirts. The 1960s were referred to as the ‘cultural decade’. A revolution started in social norms about clothing, music, drugs, formalities and schooling. Many denounced this decade as a time of social decay. The 1970s, known as the “pivot of change” felt economic upheavals. Social progressive values saw an increase in political awareness and liberty of women or feminism. There was opposition to nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War. There was advocacy for world peace and environment protection. The 1980s saw wealth and production migrate to newly industrialized countries resulting in job losses close to home. Child poverty rates were recorded at 11.7%. The 1990s experienced a rise in multiculturalism and alternative media including cable television and the internet. Through nine decades of change in our city, The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund was on hand to help support families in need. Until 2001, The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund was available to 40,000 children residing in Toronto. The year 2002, however, became a benchmark year for The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund. For the first time in its history, the charity expanded its boundaries beyond Toronto to help children living in Mississauga and Brampton. In 2004, the program expanded yet again to service families in Ajax and Pickering. With assistance from supporting agencies, our sister newspapers (The Mississauga News, The Brampton Guardian and The Ajax-Pickering News Advertiser) and hundreds of delivery volunteers, the expansion program has been a great success. Now, 45,000 children receive a gift at Christmas. The Toronto Star continues to work closely with its sister newspapers to turn this into a community endeavor in each of the cities. The campaign has become known locally as “The Mississauga News Santa Claus Fund” in Mississauga and in Brampton it is known as “The Brampton Guardian Santa Claus Fund” while in Ajax and Pickering, it is called “The Ajax-Pickering News Advertiser Santa Claus Fund.” Similar to the Toronto Star, these community newspapers help raise funds by featuring stories in their papers. The money is channeled back to the Toronto Star to purchase the product and package the merchandise prior to distribution. The gift box quantities and contents may have changed with the times but the basic concept remains. Today, a total of 45,000 bright gift boxes are filled with a warm shirt, socks, mittens, hat, book, toy, candy and toothbrush with toothpaste. The merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers or suppliers at significant cost-savings. Great consideration is given to each item purchased for the gift box – quality, style, safety, value and variety. The items reflect age, not gender. As a result of this process and to ensure all children are treated equitably, only cash contributions can be accepted; not donations of product or services-in-kind. The names of the children, from newborn to age 12, are submitted to The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund by more than 100 social and community service agencies. The gift packages are still delivered to the homes of the children by hundreds of volunteers such as Scouts Canada, church groups, service clubs, etc., just as they were back in 1906. One century later, the generosity of Star readers continues to make Christmas a little bit happier for less-fortunate children. From a memory of an impoverished childhood, The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund has been helping children smile for more than a century. To read about    To read more about Joseph E.

"The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund is a registered children’s charity that provides 45,000 underprivileged children with a gift at Christmas. Founded in 1906 by Star publisher Joseph Atkinson, The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund has raised millions of dollars over the years and provided hundreds of thousands of children with a decorated gift box containing warm clothing, a toy, book, candy and dental hygiene items. In many cases, this may be the only gift they receive during the holidays. As a result of generous contributions from Toronto Star readers, past recipients, organizations and businesses, children are able to believe that Santa did not forget them. Many of the children receiving the gift box are referred by more than 100 social and community service agencies. Several come from families who are struggling financially, may be single-parent families and newly landed immigrant homes. The fundraising goal is $1.7 million. The money donated toward this goal is directed toward purchasing the gift boxes and merchandise contained within. During the fall-to-Christmas campaign, daily stories are featured in the Toronto Star and on the Star’s website, the star.com. The stories reflect a variety of topics including the children who receive the gift boxes, the agencies that service these children, various fundraising events, donors who contribute, past recipients and volunteers who help with the program. All donors receive a tax receipt for income tax purposes in the new year. Acknowledgment cards are available upon request by calling 416-869-4848. Unless anonymity is requested by a donor, all contributions are published in the newspaper with options available as follows: Example 1: In memory of Mrs. Smith Example 2: In lieu of gifts to clients of ABC Co. Example 3: In honour of Ms. Jones’ 80   B-Day. By helping children in our communities, we’re helping to build a brighter future for our city and surrounding communities. to read  ",0,What We Do
"Twin sisters Nancy and Rebecca struggled to complete high school and fit in when family trauma forced them and their mother into Toronto’s shelter system. But   for girls, aged 6 to 15, who have experienced trauma, abuse and unstable caregiving was a sanctuary, says Nancy, now 23. “Every year I looked forward to going,” she says of the camp on the shores of Georgian Bay. “It helped me escape hardships in the city and learn new skills. And it made me more confident.” “It’s a place where you can be yourself and experience something new that you have never done before,” adds Rebecca. “At camp, we met other kids like us we could relate to and it helped us be more outgoing at school.” In addition to giving the shy sisters the coping skills and confidence to weather chronic homelessness during their difficult teen years, the camp connected them to tutors and counselling for school. In college, StepStones helped with housing, scholarships, tutoring and lifelong mentors for their journey into adulthood. “StepStones has helped me a lot and continues to help me today,” says Nancy, who graduated from Seneca College in 2017 with a university degree in international business. She has been working in a currency exchange kiosk since February and in her spare time is studying project management. Nancy eventually wants to take the Canadian Securities Course to prepare her for a possible career in banking. Rebecca has completed a two-year interior design diploma from Humber College and is halfway through a four-year bachelor of craft and design (textiles) degree at Sheridan College’s Oakville campus, sparked by her passion for crafts at StepStones camp.  “My mentor helped me make the change,” says Rebecca, who hopes to one day start a small business in fabric print design.  StepStones Summer Camp is receiving financial assistance from the Star’s   for the first time this year, one of 102 camps supported by the charity. “Fresh Air funding is huge,” said StepStones’ executive director Heather O’Keefe. “It is a name people recognize and trust, so it has been a big vote of confidence in what we do,” she says. “We take kids based on funding. So the more funding we get, the more kids we can help,” she adds. The camp is serving about 70 girls this summer over two seven-day sessions. It costs $600 to send one girl to camp, and $800 for teens aged 13 to 15 to attend the leadership camp. O’Keefe, who has worked in the child protection system for more than 14 years and loved summer camp as a child, co-founded StepStones in 2004 to serve girls in foster care, the shelter system and other precarious living environments. For the first few years, she ran the camp during her summer vacations. But by 2012, when she added year-round co-ed mentoring and support for teens aged 16 and up, it became a full-time mission.   serves about 300 teens and young adults a year. “I worked with so many kids who did well in foster care but then fell apart when they left care,” O’Keefe says. “I wanted to do something about that.” Just 44 per cent of youth who have been involved with the child protection system complete high school and even fewer attend college or university, O’Keefe notes. About 57 per cent are unemployed or rely on social assistance as young adults. And they make up about 58 per cent of the youth homeless population. A staggering 76 per cent become victims of crime within 12 months of leaving the system. The camp and teen mentorship program are attempts to beat the depressing odds, O’Keefe says. Camp activities, including book club, canoeing, swimming lessons, robotics and environmental science, are led by specially trained counsellors who become strong female role models, she says. “Every youth learns a skill they can use in their daily lives, including coping strategies to deal with anxiety.”  Creating kind, confident and successful young women is the goal. “It is a philosophy that recognizes that every child has these traits and it is our job to bring that out,” O’Keefe says. Like most of the girls who attend StepStones camp, Nancy and Rebecca have blossomed and are among many who return after turning 16 to work in the camp kitchen. Looking back, both sisters say they enjoyed arts and crafts the most. But when asked about her enduring memory of camp, Nancy doesn’t hesitate. “Kind, confident and successful,” she says. “It was like our mantra. I’ll never forget that.” The Star’s Fresh Air Fund aims to raise $650,000 to send 25,000 kids to camp this summer. ",0,"Fresh Air Fund: Girls’ camp nurtures kind, confident and successful kids"

"The Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund was established in 1906 by Toronto Star Founder, Joseph E. Atkinson. Atkinson knew of poverty first-hand. His father was killed in a tragic accident when he was six months old. Left with eight young children to raise, his mother struggled to support the family. It was a very special Christmas in Atkinson's own childhood that brought out his dedication to help the poor. As the story goes, one day young Joseph was watching other children skate on the pond. A lady approached and asked him why he wasn't skating. When she heard his sad tale, she bought him his first pair of skates for Christmas. Atkinson never forgot the warmth and generosity of the stranger who made this Christmas Day the happiest of his childhood. Years later, Atkinson used The Toronto Star Newspaper to tell readers the stories of other needy children. He asked readers to contribute money, which was used to buy approximately 100 Christmas gifts. The gifts of fruit, candy, socks and mitts were distributed through his local Toronto church, Little Trinity. This tradition lives on with a Toronto Star reporter still writing daily articles about the plight of needy children prior to Christmas. The gift packages may have changed with the times but the basic concept remains. Today, bright gift boxes are filled with a warm shirt, socks, mittens, hat, book, toy, cookies and dental hygiene kit. The merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers at significant cost-savings. Therefore, only cash contributions can be accepted, not donations of product or services-in-kind. Great consideration is given to each item purchased for the gift box -- quality, style, safety, value, variety, and all items reflect age, not gender. For the first time in its history, The Toronto Star Claus Fund expanded its services in 2002 to assist families in Brampton and Mississauga, as well as Toronto. In 2004, the program expanded yet again to help children in Ajax and Pickering. To help raise funds, the Toronto Star, The Brampton Guardian, The Mississauga News and The Ajax-Pickering News Advertiser feature regular stories in their papers eight weeks prior to Christmas. Children’s names are submitted to the Santa Claus Fund by Ontario Works and more than 100 other social service agencies in Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga, Ajax and Pickering. Just as they were in 1906, the gift boxes are still delivered to the homes of the children by volunteers such as church groups, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, etc. More than one century later, the generosity of our readers continues to make Christmas a little bit happier for 45,000 less-fortunate children! The 2018 Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund goal is $1.7 million. All donors will receive a tax receipt for income tax purposes after the campaign. Acknowledgement cards are available upon request by calling 416-869-4847. Donor contributions will be published in the newspaper during the campaign until mid-January. All contributions are published in the newspaper as a full- page notice. Options available are as follows: Example #1: In memory of Mrs. Smith; #2: Anonymous; #3: In lieu of gifts to ABC Co. clients.

"For the next six weeks, the location of Santa’s secret workshop is a strip mall in North Etobicoke.  That’s where volunteers and staffers working for the Toronto Star Santa Claus Fund will be toiling in a makeshift warehouse to pack and deliver gift boxes to 45,000 disadvantaged children across the Toronto area.  Created by Star publisher Joseph Atkinson in 1906, the fund has been making the Christmas season brighter for struggling families for more than a century. It takes a tremendous amount of planning and hard work to deliver the gift boxes, each of which contains gender-neutral but age-appropriate toys, games, books, clothing, and necessities like toothbrushes and toothpaste. Many of those who work to distribute the boxes have decided to do so because they know firsthand how much it means for families to get a helping hand over the holidays. Deedra Sarju, who was among a team of HP Inc. employees volunteering at the warehouse one morning this week, said she grew up in the low-income area around Jane St. and Finch Ave. West. Although her family was reasonably well-off, many of the kids she grew up with weren’t so lucky.  “I had friends that were not able to celebrate Christmas or did not get Christmas gifts,” she said.  Memories of those friends is one of the things that has motivated Sarju to help Santa Claus Fund families. She’s been volunteering for five years, and this year decided to spend her birthday helping out at the warehouse. “It’s nice to know that these children will have something to open on Christmas, and it shows them that someone does care,” she said. Julio Gouveia, who was bundling gift boxes for children in the same family, said he wanted to work for the Santa Claus Fund to pay forward the charity he received as a child.  A retired Star employee, he grew up poor on the Portuguese islands of the Azores, where American soldiers from the nearby airbase would supply him and his classmates with shoes and other gifts.  “So I can appreciate what these kids are going through,” Gouveia said of the Santa Claus Fund recipients. “When they see other kids getting presents and gifts and they  get none, it’s hard.”  It takes about four months to get the gift boxes to thousands of children in need in Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Ajax, and Pickering.  The “elves” who make the Santa Claus Fund tick begin setting up the gift-box operation in September.  For roughly two weeks, two trucks a day unload empty boxes at the warehouse. Packing the boxes with the gifts takes the entire month of October, with hundreds of volunteers and about 10 paid staffers working six days a week.  Workers then sort all the packages to make sure the boxes being sent to each family match the number and age of the children in the household, which takes another two-and-a-half weeks.  The boxes for each family are bound together, and then stacked around the warehouse according to postal code. From there they’re sent to local “depots,” where volunteers pick them up and deliver them, a task that’s usually completed by mid-December.  Families are referred to the fund through provincial welfare programs and community social assistance groups.  The names, children’s ages, and addresses of all of the families are transferred from application forms to a computer system by hand, a wrist-aching task that this week was being performed by four women in a tiny room off of the cavernous warehouse. One of them was Beth Patterson, who has been donating to the fund for years. When she retired from her job as an IT project manager a few years ago, she decided to volunteer, and this holiday season she was hired to work at the fund. “When people look for charities to support, you want it to be meaningful, and I find this very meaningful… I think at the end of the day it’s one of the most satisfying things I’ve ever done,” she said.  “Every child should have a gift under the tree.”  .

Over the noon-hour that same day, members of the Star’s trust committee, formed more than a year ago to improve transparency of our journalism, held an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit. (Reddit is a discussion, rating and news aggregation website). Here we present some edited highlights of the AMA, which saw more than two dozen questions from readers. Responses and questions have been cut for length and clarity.  .    Research has shown that Canadians are generally unaware of the financial challenges of the media industry ... At one point, advertising helped pay the bills of expensive journalism — and journalism is expensive. But Facebook and Google are taking up about three-quarters of the entire industry’s ad revenue. In other words, American tech giants are reaping the rewards of work done by Canadian media outlets, rather than the outlets actually doing the work. Also, good, responsible journalism is very expensive. It can take a reporter weeks at times to verify a key fact in a story. It looks, to the reader, like a sentence. But that sentence took multiple tools to verify and confirm.  —   As journalists, I think we all need to commit to being fair, impartial, accurate and transparent about our processes. When columnists provide opinion, it’s critical the reader or viewer knows that’s exactly what they’re getting. Diverse voices, even those we disagree with, are critical to free press. But the public needs to know there is a difference between opinion and reporting.   It’s always possible that a detail was missed in the production of any story. If this is the case, we provide many ways for readers to get in touch with us to let us know. Aside from our ‘contact us’ page, which provides a number of ways to get in touch but is not always easy to find, at the bottom of every article page ... is a Twitter link or email address for that staff member for extremely easy access.    I do believe in the big World Wide Web that some information can be “fake,” or at the very least, not corroborated, sourced, etc. The onus is on the news organization to follow practices that demonstrate the news is trusted. Is the story solid for sources, background?Who is the reporter, what have they reported? Is there an error-reporting system?   You make a very good point and one we are incredibly cognizant of in our newsrooms across the country. I was largely responsible for hiring new staff in our Western Canada newsrooms earlier this year as part of the StarMetro expansion and I can assure you there was a tremendous amount of attention paid to diversity in all stripes from gender to ethnicity to race. The reporting and management staff are a microcosm of the cities in which they tell stories.

Two 1904 editorials amplify the Star's reasoning in the early days of the paper's long campaign for Canadian independence, when the publisher still fumed over the decision in the Alaska boundary dispute that favoured the United States and caused shock and anger in Canada.

"At a time when global trust in journalism is at a crisis point and the media literacy gap between news organizations and their audiences seems never wider, the Toronto Star is taking concrete steps to be more accountable and transparent to you, its readers.  On Tuesday, the Star announced that it is formally a partner in the  , a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism. The project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster trust by helping to guide audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found them.  With Tuesday’s announcement, the Star joins more than 30 other credible news companies, such as the Washington Post, the Economist and the Globe and Mail, participating in the Trust Project. “We keep saying journalism matters but we weren’t showing how, or why, or what journalism actually is. That was the inspiration for our own trust project, which began in May 2017. And it was the inspiration for being part of this larger effort to be transparent and accountable on all kinds of fronts,” said Star Editor Irene Gentle.  The Star’s internal trust committee, an ongoing initiative made up of employees across Torstar, has overseen the creation of a dedicated  , a larger   of Star news terms, new conventions on story labelling, and a weekly   looking at the various ways the Star does its journalism. “The Star has long had a very deep commitment to responsible, public service journalism. We have a public editor, independent from the newsroom for people to voice complaints to. We are part of National Newsmedia Council, an independent body that oversees and adjudicates journalism complaints. We have a code of conduct. We have ethical discussions on what we do and how we do it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. We know this but we weren’t telling our story,” said Gentle. In the global Trust Project, participating media organizations agree to follow certain disclosure standards, known as  , developed by news executives around the world following dozens of interviews with readers that sought to discern what audiences value in news. The indicators essentially present a variety of information about the publication that readers have said is important, such as ownership structure, executive makeup, mission statement, ethics, sources of funding, and journalistic standards and policies. The indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about reporters that highlight their expertise and track records. Participants also state any commitments to presenting more diverse perspectives, citations and references for published statements of fact, and information about why certain stories were pursued and by what means. Lehrman likens the Trust Indicators for news to the equivalent of nutrition information. “It’s like a nutrition label that you would get on a piece of news,” Lerhman said in an interview. “Maybe you care a lot about ethics. Maybe you care a lot about the author’s expertise. Maybe you care a lot about the organization as a whole. So, you will get all these pieces of information and you can make your own decisions about what news you want to trust.” How does this all translate into what Star readers will experience? For starters, at the bottom of every article published on  , readers will now find links to three trust-related features: a more visible “ ” button, a link to the Star’s   and a link to the organization’s “ ” page.  In recent months, the latter two features have undergone substantial revision overseen by   Kathy English. Behind the scenes, the Star’s development team has been working on updating and standardizing internet markup language that will help the Trust Project’s tech partners — Google, Facebook, and Bing, to name just a few — better guide audiences to trusted sources.

"It is not news to tell you we are in the midst of a global crisis in media trust. While I find some consolation in the fact that recent studies tell us that Canadians trust their news more than do news consumers in other parts of the world, the overall data on trust in journalism in Canada and beyond makes clear that serious news organizations such as the Star should not underestimate public skepticism about journalism. Increasingly, in this time when misinformation can go viral across the internet and that vile f-word epithet (f— news) has been weaponized against journalists and news organizations, those of us who take journalistic responsibility seriously must take steps to show that we are real news. To that end, the Star announced the good news this week that it is a partner in the  , a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism. This project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster reader trust by helping to guide digital news audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found trusted sources amidst the noise and nonsense that can be found across the Internet and especially on social media. The project is funded by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Google, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund and the Markkula Foundation. In becoming part of this initiative, the Star joins a group of global news organizations committed to incorporating “Trust Indicators” into all digital content. These indicators are key transparency standards for news and information that help readers recognize the commitments and expertise behind trustworthy journalism. These include a new    that states clearly the Star’s mission, its ownership structure, leadership team and its key ethical standards. You can now find a link to that page on every piece of content on thestar.com — as well as a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a highly visible means to report an error. As the Star’s transparency reporter Kenyon Wallace told you on  ,  these indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about our reporters that highlight their expertise and backgrounds. What is trusted news? Across Torstar news organizations, we define trusted news as accurate, accountable and ethically produced. Being accurate means verifying information before sharing it – and correcting mistakes when they happen. Being accountable means being transparent and open about what we do and how we do it. Being ethical means producing news and information according to ethical standards as set out in Torstar’s recently updated  .  All these measures are key requirements for becoming part of the Trust Project. Its Trust Indicators are well-thought out signals for readers established by international news leaders following consultations with news audiences about what they believe makes journalism trustworthy. As Craig Newmark, one of the project’s funders told the Poynter Institute’s contributing editor David Beard in an interview ,  “News outlets want to make a statement, a credible statement, that they can be trusted. We need a Better Business Bureau, the equivalent of Consumer Reports (for journalism), but the first step is for a news outlet to come out credibly and say, ‘Hey, you can trust us’.” While the work required to incorporate all of these trust indicators across all the Star’s digital content has been extensive in recent months, I think it also bears stating that the values that provide the foundation for these trust indicators are not new for the Star, a 126-year-old news organization that has put a high value on ethical journalism and accountability to its readers for many decades. For me, that is evidenced by the fact that the Star has had a public editor/ombudsman to respond to reader concerns about accuracy and ethics since 1972. Still, given the current often nasty environment of online misinformation and mistrust in media throughout the world, it matters much that the Star do all it can to show you its strong commitment to delivering trusted news, information and content on all platforms.

"At the beginning of this year, as part of the Star’s ongoing transparency project, we published a feature looking at how our newsroom style committee strives to maintain a sensitive, clear and consistent presentation of content. The article, which delved into the role of the style committee and its decisions on word usage, proved popular with readers. In light of that, we thought it would be fun — and, we hope, of value — to look at the reasoning behind why the Star has made certain style decisions about specific words. The examples we have chosen for this feature are a sampling of words — some quirky, some contentious — from the Star Stylebook, a newsroom resource providing guidance on everything from spelling, capitalization and punctuation to the use of numbers, measurements and foreign words and phrases. We sat down with Anthony Collins and Jon Ohayon, co-chairs of the Star’s style committee, to get the goods on who is winning the name game in one Toronto neighbourhood and whatever happened to that reliable staple, the good old hot dog. The Canadian Press, the national wire service that publishes a well-respected guide on style, prefers   but Star style is  , on the grounds that it’s more commonly used. Many say daylight savings time, but that’s less common than the singular.   is convenient  in headlines, though — a useful fallback(ward) position. Canadian Geographic magazine ruffled some feathers in 2016 when it proclaimed   to be our “new national bird” but spelled its name the American way: . We knew that wouldn’t fly, so the Star used the Canadian spelling   in our coverage, relying on the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for backup. The species was recently renamed the Canada jay, so patriotic birdwatchers and word watchers can both breathe easy. It’s a decades-old debate that may never be resolved: what to call the east-end Toronto neighbourhood by the lake. Many longtime residents insist on the singular form  , but others swear it’s always been  . The Beach won out in a 2006 neighbourhood poll and that’s the name that appears on street signs along Queen St. The Star planted its flag in the Beach camp, too, in 2009, when it created a neighbourhood map of Toronto with input from readers. You’ll still see “Beaches” in the Star: in quotes, for instance, or in the name of the federal/provincial riding, Beaches—East York. But when it’s our choice, we prefer the Beach. Though we capitalize  , we lowercase  as both a noun and a verb. In the early days, around 2008-09, our archives show we capitalized   quite often, as it seemed exotic.  The Star stylebook advises writers to “use gender-neutral terms such as spokesperson, chair, camera operator, firefighter and letter carrier whenever possible.” As with any style rule, there are always exceptions: words like  ,   and   are still so common that they’re hard to avoid (and don’t get us started on  , which many insist is gender-neutral). On the other hand,   and   are so widespread that their gendered antecedents are seldom heard now. In between are phrases like   and   that will sound natural to some readers and drive others up the wall. Preferring gender-neutral terms may lead to accusations of political correctness run amok, but the language is constantly evolving, and what sounds odd or stilted today may soon be common parlance. The Canadian Press’s two-word style seems a bit archaic:  / . (There’s also a note that it should be used with discretion.) Star style —   — seems much less jarring and less clunky as an adjective, though we also use it with discretion and it mainly appears in quotes. Readers often remind us that God should be capitalized, though in this common phrase, we disagree.  The Star follows Canadian Press style on the abbreviation for microphone, which used to be  . In 2015, it was changed to  . The phenomenon of the   would have looked bizarre in print as   and   is much less prevalent online.　 CP’s longtime preference for spelling   as one word didn’t pass mustard — er, muster — with some readers. It always looked a little strange to us, too. So we were glad when the CP Caps and Spelling guide recently changed its entry to   — no doubt avoiding many future bunfights. ",0,What’s in a word?
"Asian Community AIDS Services, Chinatown. The Drake Hotel, West Queen West. Planned Parenthood, The Annex. The Palm House at Allan Gardens. Glad Day Bookshop in the Village. The 519 LGBTQ2S Community Centre. Just some of the cherished safe spaces highlighted by 10 people in Toronto’s LGBTQ community interviewed for a   by Star journalists Evy Kwong, Kelsey Wilson and Carlos Osorio. The feature, published late last month just in time for the city’s annual Pride weekend, comprised text, video, audio and photographs to go inside the spaces identified by the interview subjects that give them a sense of sanctuary. Kwong, a digital producer, says the idea for the project was formed in response to the tragic deaths of several members of Toronto’s LGBTQ community who police believe were murdered by alleged serial killer  . “Even though it had seemed that acceptance and inclusivity was progressing for the community, there was reason to feel more unsafe than ever,” Kwong explained in an interview. “We wanted to talk to a spectrum of people on where they felt sanctuary despite the news of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur. Where did these people feel they could be 100 per cent safe?” With that question in mind, Kwong and colleagues Wilson, a video producer, and photographer Osorio, set out to find 10 people to talk openly about their safe spaces and identities. It was a challenging task. With just four days before publication, the journalists had to track subjects down, meet them at various locations across the city, shoot video and collect audio, edit and type up interviews.  Kwong began by reaching out to friends in the LGBTQ community, who referred her to people they thought might want to speak about their experiences. She also reached out to more well known figures in the community such as city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam and Armand Digdoyo, an event producer, who also founded New Ho Queen, a collective highlighting the Asian queer community. “We were in a rush, but I still wanted to ensure that we had an array of voices, because being LGBTQ is so much more than just the terms in the acronym, and we were blessed to have such enthusiastic response, even on a day’s notice,” Kwong said.  Meanwhile, Wilson and Osorio met with representatives of Pride Toronto to get feedback on the concept and to ensure they were properly representing the LGBTQ community. The response was a thumbs up.  When it came to photography, Osorio says he was aiming for “something bright and very in your face.” But he also wanted to hint at the tragedies faced by the LGBTQ community this year, so he added a dark edge around the frames of his photos to “show that all is still not well and that a bit of a cloud still hangs over this year’s Pride.” Osorio added that a challenge for him was trying to keep the look of the photographs consistent while being in different locations.  A recurring dilemma the journalists encountered more than once during the course of their interviews was that some of their subjects told them they hadn’t fully “come out” to their families yet.  “Of course, we were immediately concerned about whether telling their stories could create lasting personal damage,” Wilson said. To address this, she says she and her colleagues were fully transparent with their subjects about what would be published. “We wanted them to feel completely comfortable with their part in the finished product. These people are trusting you with deeply personal stories and you feel obligated to do them justice.” ",0,Finding safe spaces for members of Toronto’s LGBTQ community
"Late last month, the Star’s wine reviewer, Carolyn Evans Hammond, wrote an article in which two of the five wines she recommended were American. Her review happened to come at a time when the Canada-U.S. trade war was reaching a fever pitch as Canada prepared to slap retaliatory tariffs on imports from its southern neighbours. Evans Hammond discovered that her recommendations of American wines did not sit well with some readers. “I generally enjoy your Saturday columns in the Star, but in light of the current state of Canada/U.S. trade relations, I find it curious to find you recommending two out of five wines coming from the U.S. this week,” one reader wrote to her. “Surely, you have heard the gathering talk on boycotting U.S. wine (and many other products) coming from this side of the border in response to the bullying tactics from the U.S. regarding trade tariffs.” “Surely there are enough great wines in the world that we do not need to promote those from the U.S. at this time. Is it possible for you to discontinue the review of U.S. wines?” asked another. One reader stated bluntly: “It’s time to stop pushing America wines in your Star column.”  While Evans Hammond says she understands the concerns of these readers, she notes her job is to recommend wines based on value for money, relative to similar wines at that price point. And that means American wines are fair game, regardless of the political climate. “From my perspective, I can’t not include wines because I don’t agree with a political situation going on in a region. That’s a huge kettle of fish,” she said in an interview. Evans Hammond says if she were to start taking a nationalist stance on her reviews, she would be doing a disservice to wine consumers and producers.  “As a wine columnist, I recommend wines from all over the world based on those that offer the best value for money within the context of a respective column. It is up to individual readers whether they want to buy American wines,” she said. “What’s important to know is this: fierce global competition in winemaking is constantly pushing quality up and prices down, so it’s a very exciting time to be a wine enthusiast. With that in mind, I try hard to keep abreast of what’s out there and to recommend only the wines I think offer the very best value for money. Then, I give each wine I recommend a score out of 100 and qualify that score with a lengthy tasting note to communicate what makes the wine special.” The Star’s public editor Kathy English said while the emails Evans Hammond received from readers were not unreasonable given the current trade situation between the U.S. and Canada, she stressed that columnists, including Evans Hammond, are fully within their remit to choose what they write about. “Columnists have the prerogative and latitude here to select the topics they write about, and in the case of reviewers, to select the products they review,” said English. “There are no policy issues at play here whatsoever.” ",0,Why review American wines during the Canada-U.S. trade war?
"The Toronto Star’s   made by U.S. President Donald Trump — compiled by Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale — is consistently among the most-read stories on thestar.com. Dale’s list of Trump’s mistruths now numbers more than 1,800 since the real-estate tycoon became president. Inspired by the popularity of Dale’s work, associate editor Lynn McAuley sought a way to assess the truthfulness of claims made by Canadian politicians. A good place to start, she thought, was   on Parliament Hill — a 45-minute session on weekdays in which Members of Parliament for Opposition parties pose questions to the governing party (MPs representing the government are also allowed to ask the odd question). Why not fact-check the claims made by Opposition parties in the framing of their questions, as well as the answers provided by the government, in order to get a sense of  how honest our elected representatives are in the spotlight? Each session is recorded in Hansard, the official transcript of Parliament.  Five days of question period in April and May were randomly chosen to be put under the microscope by Ottawa Bureau reporters Bruce Campion-Smith, Alex Ballingall, Alex Boutilier and Tonda MacCharles, along with reporters Brendan Kennedy and Marco Chown Oved in Toronto.  Question period can see upwards of 40 questions, producing some 9,000 words in one 45-minute session. That meant the team had to check about 45,000 words over the five days examined. “We were helped that there was duplication from day to day as opposition parties hammered away at a particular topic, such as the carbon tax,” said Ottawa Bureau Chief Bruce Campion-Smith. Every morning, a reporter in Ottawa shared the previous day’s question period transcript in a Google Doc, explained Kennedy. Subjects were divvied up randomly or according to previous experience or interest in a topic. Claims were assessed as true, false, a stretch or a dodge. “We really sought to be fair in how we labelled questions and answers,” Campion-Smith said. “That meant a lot of research into a particular topic and evaluating the statements by MPs and cabinet ministers.” To check the validity of MPs’ statements, the reporters consulted government budgets, parliamentary committee reports, statements by ministers and policies. In some cases, the reporters reached out to MPs’ offices to ask for the source of their information, and then sought verification through further research. “The toughest claims to fact check were the vague or generalized assertions, and anything that was a borderline opinion,” Kennedy said. “If an MP stated an exact number, it was usually pretty easy to determine whether or not it was accurate. But if they said that something was ‘out of control’ or ‘chaotic,’ then it was a little trickier to make an assessment.” For example, in a preamble to one of her questions on April 30,  Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said that social programs across Canada are under “severe strain due to tens of thousands of unplanned immigrants” crossing the border illegally. To check these claims, Kennedy searched news sources and government reports about social programs strained by an increase in irregular migrants. Only in Quebec, where most of the migrants arrived, and in Toronto, where many of them end up, did he find evidence of a strain on social services. To fortify this, he looked up the statistics for irregular border crossers and found that 93 per cent of the RCMP interceptions at the border since the beginning of 2017 have been in Quebec. In fact, seven provinces had a combined 21 irregular border crossings in all of 2017.  “Clearly, her claim that social programs were under severe strain ‘across Canada’ was false,” Kennedy said. Overall, the reporters found that outright lies or false claims in question period were uncommon.  “However, that is offset by what we did find and that is the amount of dodges on the government side, the refusal to meaningfully answer a question,” Campion-Smith said. “The opposition parties are not blameless, either. On their side, there are a lot of exaggerations. So, I think people have a right to be cynical about the whole exercise when they say it’s largely driven by partisan motivations. But I think it’s also a very important part of our parliamentary democracy and the principle of holding a government to account.” ",0,How a team of Star reporters scrutinized claims by MPs
"In the foreground, a black bicycle lies on its side in the middle of the road, its front wheel and handlebar bent into awkward angles. What looks like a black bag sits beside the bike. In the background, a few metres feet away, a flatbed truck sits motionless. Two police personnel stand nearby. That’s a description of a photo published in the Toronto Star last week showing the scene on June 12 at the intersection of Bloor and St. George Sts., where Dalia Chako, 58, a grandmother who loved cycling, was hit and killed in a collision with a flatbed truck. A disturbing image, to be sure, the publication of which was the subject of intense discussions among editors in the newsroom. There were other photos from the scene, all taken by Star photographer Lucas Oleniuk, that were even more graphic in nature that were under consideration. This week, we take a behind-the-scenes look at the factors editors considered when deciding which photo of this tragic event to publish. Originally, in the afternoon on the day of the collision, the plan was to use a photo of the collision scene that showed a tarp lying beside the crushed bicycle. But that changed when photo assignment editor Tim Finlan flagged that the tarp was in fact covering the body of the victim. So began a discussion in the middle of the newsroom that grew to include more than half a dozen editors about whether the photo was too graphic to publish. “On one side, we have to be really sensitive about using photos that show victims’ bodies, even if they are completely covered,” said Catherine Wallace, assistant managing editor of news. “It becomes so easy to imagine it could have been my mother or sister or friend who died in the accident. How would I feel if a picture of their body covered by a tarp was in the paper? It’s a question of dignity and respect.” On the other hand, cycling deaths are a serious issue, one the city has been grappling with for years, Wallace noted. “When there is a terrible accident like this one, we want people to pay attention. We want people to stop and think and say, ‘this can’t continue, things must change,’” she said. “Sometimes it’s important to be shocked and upset — for a newspaper to shock and upset people — and photographs are one of the best ways of doing that.” As editors gathered around the photo desk to examine the image closely, they kept coming back to one question: was this the time to shock and upset people? Oleniuk volunteered to return to the scene in an attempt to capture the gravitas of the situation without the body in frame. The Star has chosen to publish photos depicting bodies in the past, such as the image of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, and the picture of the body of a teenage Haitian girl shot dead by police in 2010. Decisions to publish such images are made on a case-by-case basis. Ultimately, Wallace and senior news editor Marie Sutherland decided, given the recent nature of the incident and the sensitivities mentioned above, it was not the right time. Instead, Oleniuk’s photo described above and pictured here — without the image of the body — was chosen for publication that day.  The next day, a different photo that showed the tarp over the body was published on thestar.com, with a story looking at the  of cyclist safety on Toronto’s streets. “The thing about the discussion that was so challenging, and I think the reason so many editors spontaneously joined in, is that there is no right or wrong answer in a situation like this. Both sides were right: It was a terrible personal tragedy, and it was also a symbol of a city-wide danger that we should all be paying more attention to,” Wallace said. “You can’t have hard and fast rules about photo use. You have to be open each time to considering the context. No two situations are ever, ever the same.” ",0,How does the Star decide when to publish graphic photos?
"The famous American playwright Arthur Miller once said in 1961, “A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself.” That’s a viewpoint held by many journalists today. And among the ways newspapers allow nations — or provinces or towns or neighbourhoods — to talk to themselves is through the oldest form of reader engagement: letters to the editor.  Letters to the editor allow readers to weigh in with their opinions, thoughts or reactions concerning any issues or events in the news. In the Toronto Star, reader letters are published at the back of the A section on Sundays and during the week, in the Insight section on Saturdays, and everyday on the  , at thestar.com. The Star receives about 25 letters per day, on average, that are suitable for publication. Most weekdays, a selection of between five and eight letters are published, while a larger number are printed on Saturdays, often focusing on the week’s biggest stories. Letters that make it to publication are chosen by editors working with the Star’s editorial board, which works independently from the newsroom, led by editorial page editor Andrew Phillips. In addition to handling letters to the editor, the editorial board is responsible for  ,  , and  .  “A good letter to the editor is timely, interesting and well-written. It focuses on the issues at hand,” Phillips said in an interview. “It’s also short — letters run from about 50 to 250 words, so a premium is placed on writers who can get to the point very quickly and express a clear view. A touch of humour helps a lot, too.” A good letter also avoids certain things. “We don’t like letters that are abusive, that engage in ad hominem attacks on other people, that mischaracterize the arguments of those the writer disagrees with, or are defamatory. We are happy to publish letters that oppose views expressed by Star editorials or columnists, but they must stick to the issues and avoid personal attacks,” said Phillips. In addition, editors try to publish a representative sample of letters sent in. The Star tends to lean left in its editorial positions and more letters the paper receives are from that perspective than from the right, Phillips notes. “We look for a range of subjects and views to keep the section lively,” he said.  Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have allowed people to express their opinions without the filter of a newspaper editorial board, and this has resulted in a decrease in the number of letters to the editor in recent years. Social media also provides the protection of anonymity, allowing some users to express all manner of thoughts behind a persona that may or may not be real.  That’s why the Star will not publish anonymous letters. In fact, the editorial board asks letter writers to disclose any conflicts of interest or involvement they may have with an issue on which they are weighing in. “For example, a person writing to oppose a transit plan should disclose that they are president of a community group fighting the plan, if that’s the case,” said Phillips. “We read letters with an eye on this possibility, and if there’s a reason to suspect some kind of involvement by the writer we may query the writer or Google the name to see if anything relevant comes up.” Crafting a compelling letter to the editor can also take more effort than sounding off on social media, so for those readers who have found their letters printed in the Star, it’s fair to say the editorial board found their comments articulate, thoughtful, or relevant.  “Nowadays readers have many other ways of expressing their views, especially through social media, but the traditional letter to the editor still remains important,” Phillips said. “And we certainly hope that readers will continue to send them in.” ",0,What makes a good letter to the editor?
"Covering an election is a massive undertaking for media organizations, involving reporters, columnists, photographers, editors, data analysts, designers and managers from across departments working together under tight deadlines.  night on June 7 saw the Toronto Star newsroom in full throttle as staff worked to keep readers up-to-date on the latest numbers from the polls preparing articles for thestar.com and two print editions for the next day.  “We wanted to make sure that, digitally on the night and in print the next day, our audience could find the answers to all the questions they were asking — who was winning at the riding and provincial levels and the implications for constituents and for the province,” said the Star’s politics editor Jordan Himelfarb, who oversaw the coordination of election night coverage. “It required finding a compelling way to present the results as they came in, highlighting the most interesting and consequential races, drawing out the storylines that defined the night and that gave final shape to the campaign, and providing analysis and commentary that put the flood of information in context.” Reporters were dispatched to be with the leaders of the four main political parties: Queen’s Park reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy were with PC leader Doug Ford in Etobicoke and the NDP’s Andrea Horwath in Hamilton, respectively. On loan to the Queen’s Park team were Wendy Gillis, who was with the Liberals’ Kathleen Wynne in North York, and Tess Kalinowski, who was dispatched to Guelph to cover Green Party leader Mike Schreiner. At the same time, Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie held down the fort at the Star’s office at the provincial legislature putting everything together for the main news story about the night’s results. Ontario politics columnist Martin Regg Cohn wrote from home. That was in addition to more than 40 other reporters assigned to cover results in ridings across the GTA, some covering two ridings at the same time. “What I was looking for was not only the facts, but also context and colour. Elections are obviously profoundly important democratic moments, with far-reaching consequences, but they are also, for both voters and political players, emotional, human things,” said Himelfarb. For thestar.com, the main feature of the night was a seat counter and a colour-coded map of the province showing which party had taken each riding in real time, fed by data from the Canadian Press. To keep stories as timely as possible, reporters were asked to file as soon as definitive results for their ridings were available. A team of editors then quickly polished the copy, wrote headlines, added photos, published the stories online and prepared them for print.  In total, more than 50 ridings were covered by the Star and Metroland publications, resulting in 63 articles, including individual riding stories, columns, editorials and a cartoon. Thursday was Himelfarb’s first election night as politics editor and he admits that the logistical challenges were daunting. But he said his life was made easier by the huge team effort put forward by Star staff. “Once the polls close and we’re inundated with results, you don’t have time to be daunted. The adrenaline carries you through.”   ",0,How the Star covers election night
"There’s something about the Star’s weekly Dating Diaries, which allows contributors to recount their best, worst, and weirdest dates in their own words, that consistently intrigues Toronto Star readers. The feature that dives into the GTA dating scene, by freelance writer Kate Carraway, is consistently one of the most popular offerings in the Life section of the paper and on thestar.com. Regular readers of Dating Diaries are unlikely to forget the story recounted by a woman who, after several dates and feeling she was really connecting with a man,   of an intimate part of his anatomy. Then there was the diary about a woman’s first sleepover. The next morning, while she was putting on her makeup in the bathroom, the guy went and  . This week, Carraway lets readers in on how she gets people to open up about the intimate details of their personal lives. I pitched Dating Diaries as a way to get the readers’ experiences directly into (now defunct weekly) The Grid and readers really responded. I think the appeal of the column is obvious — it’s provocative, it’s voyeuristic, it’s fun, it’s educational, it’s sad and happy and embarrassing and funny, and really a vehicle for empathy. It also gives diarists an opportunity to share some very personal moments outside of the usual context of their lives, where friends might judge or where they may not have the chance to revel in something amazing or weird that happened. The Diarists all provide an overview of the date, at first just a short one so I can assess it. Often people submit stories about relationships, rather than dates, or almost-but-not-quite dates, or dates in which there’s no emotional turn or surprise or interest, or that serve some kind of agenda. If a date and a diarist seem like a fit, I ask for the full story, and then I dig in. The asides they might not have thought of as interesting often become the most revealing elements of the Diary. It’s the most fun kind of excavation, for me. I just keep asking questions and clarifying the details, emotional logic, and the tick-tock of the date until it’s tightly packed into the Dating Diaries form. It needs to be cogent, but it needs to maintain the diarist’s voice and experience. Sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s excruciating. Usually, people come to me via  . It’s really not hard to find great Diarists. Usually they are readers of the column already. Often Star readers and former daters recommend the column to friends who have had an especially interesting date. If I meet someone in real life who has a crazy story I always ask them to do a Diary for me. I love talking about my work so a lot of Diaries have come from my extended network, too. There are definitely certain themes in the Diaries that emerge again and again. I hear a lot about what kinds of dating mistakes men and women make that are thought to be demonstrated by the column. I hear a lot from older people about how dating was different when they were young, and from people who are just now dating after a divorce, or later in life, and find online dating to be difficult to navigate. A lot of people don’t like it when the “rating” that the Dater has given their date doesn’t seem to match their experience.  I think people are almost desperate for reality, or what the late Tom Wolfe called “status life:” the daily, quotidian details of our existence. Not the kind of shock-value content that is all over the internet and media, but genuine and honest real life. It’s becoming popular to talk about the value of vulnerability, and I think people are understanding that more and more, but in a practical sense it’s still risky to be truly vulnerable, socially and professionally and in relationships and maybe especially in dating. I want people to feel like they’ve engaged with someone else’s life in a real and intimate way. I want people to see outside themselves and consider what life is like for someone else, even for a few minutes. I want people to be informed and entertained and to have an opinion about it.

"It’s provincial election season in Ontario, and that means the editorial boards of newspapers across the province are studying the platforms of each party and keeping a close eye on their leaders in order to determine which candidate to endorse. Political endorsements by newspapers, including the Star, are a long tradition in journalism, dating back more than a century. Historically, the Star’s political endorsements have generally leaned left, in keeping with the newspaper’s alignment with the Atkinson principles, a set of progressive values named for former legendary publisher Joseph E. Atkinson. In the previous 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, for example, the Star endorsed the Liberals 10 times, the NDP twice and the Progressive Conservatives twice. The Star’s editorial board, which operates independently from the newsroom, determines which party and candidate to endorse, but not without much scrutiny of the parties’ policies, vision, and the actions and temperament of their leaders. “It’s part of our role to encourage debate and take a stand on the issues that matter to the community. We’re constantly giving our opinion on everything from subways to trade, so to remain silent on such a big choice as who should lead the province would be odd,” said editorial page editor Andrew Phillips. He stressed, however, that a position taken by the editorial board doesn’t influence news coverage and an endorsement isn’t “telling” readers who to vote for. “We’re just sharing our opinion as citizens and making an argument for that choice.” That’s where editorial board meetings with the candidates come into play. Every election season, the Star invites the leaders of all the major parties to come to One Yonge St. and sit down with members of the editorial board, as well as journalists and editors from across departments. So far during this provincial election campaign, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath have met with the board. PC Leader Doug Ford and Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne have been invited. Wynne will be here May 28 at 1 p.m. Email questions to  .  The idea is to see how the leaders react to tough questioning and how they defend their positions. “Leaders who rely too much on canned talking points don’t come across as very impressive,” said Phillips. “You want to see someone actively considering the arguments and responding intelligently when their positions are challenged. Leaders are going to have to deal with unexpected situations, and having a dozen journalists quiz you on your positions is a pretty good test of how well they’re going to be able to handle that.” This year, the Star decided to increase transparency by live streaming these meetings on thestar.com. Readers are encouraged to send in questions, which the editorial board poses to the candidates. For the editorial board meeting with Horwath, which took place last Wednesday over the noon hour, readers sent in more than 100 questions. Many questions covered the similar subjects, so the editorial board chose a few to represent readers’ main concerns. “The live stream gives readers an opportunity to engage with whatever the politician is saying, and to respond, comment or ask more questions in real-time. The idea is to help readers feel they are involved in the conversation,” said the Star’s social media editor Evelyn Kwong, who relays reader questions to the editorial board.  Phillips notes that the live stream also invites readers into a key part of the way the Star’s editorial board examines the choices in the election campaign. “Readers often wonder how we go about making up our minds on which party to support at the end of a campaign, and live streaming opens the doors on one of the main tools we use to decide — direct access to the party leaders,” he said.

"A few weeks ago, sports reporter Morgan Campbell received a direct message through Twitter from a publicist representing Canadian boxer Adonis Stevenson. How would Campbell like a sit-down interview with the light-heavyweight world champion? It was a chance to gain some insight into what was going on in Stevenson’s head before his high-profile bout against Badou Jack to defend his WBC light-heavyweight title at the Air Canada Centre on May 19. The publicist hinted that the interview might touch on Stevenson’s past, so Campbell wanted to make clear that he would explore it. “Sounds like Adonis’ team has come to grips with the fact that at some point, people are going to write about the pimping and the jail time,” he wrote back. When Stevenson was a teenager growing up in Montreal, he was a member of a gang that ran prostitutes and forced them to hand over their money. Gang members were eventually caught, and Stevenson went to prison for 18 months. While Quebec media have reported on Stevenson’s history with the law, it is lesser-known in Toronto.  The publicist agreed to set up the interview. Campbell immediately thought the interview could be a good jumping-off point for a feature as part of his Sports Prism project, a weekly series on thestar.com and in the Toronto Star that explores the intersection of sports and other areas of society, such as health, race, science, and business. The idea is to use sports as a prism through which to view societal issues.  Topics covered since the series launched seven weeks ago include how   of Major League Baseball players, how a   is attempting to develop a lucrative following, and how former NFL legend Eddie George sees the   ripe for a makeover. “For whatever reason, so many of us are addicted to sports. If that’s the starting point, I just look for ways to take advantage of that to tell a different kind of story,” said Campbell, who has been a full-time reporter at the Star for 14 years. “Sports are a good way to view these issues for the same reason that they put vitamins in gummy forms: it tastes better.” For the  , Campbell felt the boxer’s past presented an opportunity to not only look at how Stevenson had changed his life, but also the lasting harm of misogyny and prostitution. “The last thing we need in sports writing is another story about the redemption of a troubled athlete and how he’s redeemed because he’s good at sports. There are a lot of those stories and they’re not always true,” Campbell said, noting that in Stevenson’s case, the boxer had to undergo a lot of personal change before he could put himself in a position to excel in sports. The challenge with this story, Campbell explained, was to address Stevenson’s past so as not to make it seem like his convictions were recent, while also being sensitive to the victims of these crimes.  “Prostitution is still here, and there are people who get out of the industry, but there is lasting harm,” he said. That’s why Campbell reached out to advocates for sex workers and to shelter staff who could speak about the challenges of recovering from the trauma inflicted by pimps and gangs. “You can talk about Stevenson’s personal evolution, but you also have to respect the fact that there were victims involved and they have scars from that time in their lives as well. I can’t tell one side of the story without the other,” he said. “To do it any other way does a disservice to everyone involved in the story, including Adonis Stevenson, and a disservice to the truth.” On that score, Campbell views his role as a messenger whose job it is to convey full, unvarnished stories about people and issues impacting society. “The best thing to do with unflattering news is to meet it head on,” he said. “If I write a puff piece about Stevenson, all I’ve done is sugar-coated some really unsavoury stuff about him, and kind of erected myself as a barrier between the audience’s understanding of who this person is, where he’s coming from, and what he is now.” ",0,How Morgan Campbell charts the intersection of sports and society
"At the conclusion of a high-profile criminal trial, media outlets will often assign a reporter to write a “deep dive” piece looking at the characters involved, the police investigation and the evidence presented in court.  It’s a way to bring readers a more fullsome picture of the trajectory and drama of a case that daily reportage of a trial often does not allow.  In order to do this, reporters need access not only to the players — police, lawyers and relatives of victims and the accused — who can provide a human angle, but also to court records that clearly lay the case out, such as the application record (essentially a massive collection of evidence), exhibits from the preliminary hearing that didn’t come out at trial, and Information to Obtain a search warrant, if used by police.  Despite the open court principle — the idea that Canadian courts are presumptively open to the public — reporters often are forced to file an application before a judge in order to access what are already public documents. Star lawyers believe the proper interpretation of common-law suggests these documents should be made available to the public when requested, without having to take the onerous, time-consuming and expensive step of going before a judge. But that’s just what reporter Amy Dempsey had to do recently while reporting on the disturbing story of the death of an entire Mississauga family — Bill Harrison, his wife Bridget Harrison, and their son, Caleb. “I have no law degree, no legal training, but the Star cannot afford to hire a lawyer every single time we are denied documents — it is too common and too expensive,” she said. Back in August 2013, Dempsey was assigned to write a weekend feature about the unusual and disturbing coincidence that all three members of the Harrison family had been found dead in the same Mississauga home between 2009 and 2013. Up until Caleb’s death in the summer of 2013, neither Bill’s nor Bridget’s death had been ruled a homicide. But that changed shortly after police found evidence that suggested Caleb, a 40-year-old father of two, had been murdered. For her first story, Dempsey told the story of the Harrison family’s custody battle with Melissa Merritt, Caleb’s ex-wife, and a series of unfortunate events that had befallen the family. That first story in 2013 had the headline, “ ?” Merritt and her common-law partner, Christopher Fattore, were later charged in all three deaths (though Merritt was not committed to stand trial on Bill’s death, while Fattore was committed to stand trial in all three.) “If the allegations proved true, it meant that police, coroners and pathologists had somehow missed two homicides. How did that happen?” asked Dempsey. She was determined to find out. “This was more than a whodunit. It was a story of mistakes made by the authorities meant to protect us, and two potentially avoidable deaths.” At the conclusion of the trial earlier this year, Fattore was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb and Bridget. He was found not guilty in Bill’s death. Merritt was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb. A mistrial was declared on her charge in Bridget’s death after the jury could not reach a verdict. Both are appealing the guilty verdicts.  After the trial, Dempsey began work on what would become an 8,000-word feature called “ ” published last month, that uncovered disturbing mistakes made by police, coroners and pathologists during their investigations into the deaths. In order to tell the story fully, Dempsey needed access to records filed in court. But getting the records, which are public, would prove a challenge. First, she had to file an application in Brampton court and had to serve all interested parties — the court, the Crown, Merritt’s defence, Fattore’s defence, and a third party she can’t name due to a publication ban. Then, once everyone had been served, Dempsey had to appear before a judge four times over a period of several weeks to make legal arguments before a decision was made.  Among the documents she found was a full transcript of Caleb Harrison’s 2010 police interview that took place hours after his mother’s body was discovered (the jury was presented with a significantly redacted version). The full transcript proved that the Harrison family had expressed concern about Merritt and Fattore from the day Bridget was killed. “I would ask where Melissa and Chris were, personally,” Caleb told the officer.  The documents also confirmed that no homicide detectives had investigated Bridget’s death, a fact that was only hinted at during trial.  The revelation of these and other details were only possible because Dempsey went to court — a step journalists might increasingly have to take. “As financial challenges continue to confront media organizations, it’s important that more journalists go to court on their own, as Dempsey did, to argue for the release of records that serve the public interest,” said Bert Bruser, the Star’s newsroom lawyer.

"“If it bleeds, it leads” is a common expression in journalism credited to journalist Eric Pooley, who wrote the phrase in a 1989 New York Magazine piece entitled “Grins, Gore and Videotape — The Trouble with Local TV News.”  There’s no doubt that “bad” news often features prominently in coverage, and has done so throughout the history of journalism. But it’s also the case that not all news is bad news. Besides informing and educating readers, news can, and should, entertain. Editors at the Star make a deliberate attempt to balance the bad news with content that is lighthearted, fun, and entertaining.  Case in point: deputy entertainment editor Debra Yeo’s coverage of reality TV. Since 2004, Yeo has been bringing readers news, previews and opinions about wildly popular reality shows, such as  ,   and  among others. These days, she focuses on  ,   and   as well as  .  This week, we sat down with Yeo to find out how she brings a critical eye to the genre. When it comes to  franchise, in particular, I usually say I have a love-hate relationship with the shows. I am both a fan and a critic. When I recap episodes, I am reporting what happened but in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek way. I say that they don’t have to watch the shows or read what I write. I know reality shows can be silly, but in my 33 years of practising journalism, I have had more response from readers about my Bachelor stories than anything else I have ever written. Reality shows can touch us in a genuinely emotional place. I have cried watching Bachelor proposals and Amazing Race eliminations, or performances on shows like   and  . These shows also sometimes confront real-world issues. Think about Rachel Lindsay being the first Black Bachelorette a couple of seasons ago, or the scandal on  when a   got out of hand. The woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it because she was blacked out on booze and prescription drugs. That raised the issue of consent since the woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it, although I don’t think Warner Bros. dealt with it as thoroughly as they should have. That is where the love-hate relationship comes in. Take the most recent season of  , for instance, in which ABC claimed to show unedited footage of Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumping his fiancée, Becca Kufrin. I found it cruel that the producers allowed Kufrin to be blindsided on camera and wrote about that. Every once in a while I have to step back and remind myself that even though the shows are formulaic and heavily produced, there are real people and emotions at play. Sure, some of the contestants sign up to get famous, but others are just ordinary men and women who want to find a wife or husband. The most powerful reminder of that was when I interviewed Brittany M., the “villain” on the most recent season of  . I asked her why she hadn’t fought harder to clear her name with Bachelor Chris Leroux after the other contestants accused her of being mean to them, and she started to cry. In her real life, she prides herself on helping empower other women, so it really hurt her feelings that the other contestants thought she was out to get them. It was a reminder that, yes, make fun of the silly things people do and say on the shows, but try not to attack them as people. I try to come at these shows from the perspective of being just another viewer who happens to write about them. If I already know what happened, I won’t be writing the recaps from an honest place. There are instances where I do get advance knowledge, like when I attended a   episode taping in Toronto, but even if I hadn’t signed a non-disclosure agreement, I wouldn’t have wanted to spoil the episode for other viewers. The same goes for the day I just spent shadowing  . ",0,The Star’s reality TV scribe keeps it real
"Social and economic programs are essential to helping the less advantaged among us. From bitter personal experience, Joseph Atkinson believed the state had a duty to help the widowed, the orphaned, the sick, the old, the unemployed, the forsaken - all those who fell by the wayside through no fault of their own. The Star publisher's humanitarian outlook was strengthened by his strong Methodist social gospel beliefs. Year after year, he developed his arguments for cradle-to-the-grave social security. And he refuted as ""scandalously untrue"" suggestions that ""lack of thrift and enterprise"" was the root cause of the great amount of distress in the city. In 1946, as the Ontario government moved to close daycare centres for children of working mothers, the Star appeared to sum up the paper's long struggle for social reform when it said on it's editorial page: ""The point at issue is simply this. Is it or is it not desirable that out-of-work people should have some means of subsistence? Is it or is it not desirable that people should be able to give their children a proper start in life? Is it or is it nor desirable that people should have proper medical care irrespective of their means? Should aged people be assured of at least some sort of income, or should they not? In brief, are human beings in a prosperous country like Canada entitled to some means of security in life? The Star thinks they are."" Crusading for social reform was bedrock Star editorial policy - and represents a glowing chapter in the history of the newspaper.  publisher was certain that many of Canada's ills could be resolved by a fairer redistribution of the nation's wealth. This view was to cause Joseph E. Atkinson much grief. His calls for an excess profit tax put him on a collision course with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and helped lead to a parting of the two men. Problems rippled to the surface soon after Atkinson took over The Evening Star in December 1899. On one hand it was agreed that Atkinson would be in complete control of editorial policy. On the other hand, it was understood that the paper would solidly support Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government. The stage was set for conflict. In time, Atkinson and Laurier seemed to have ""a fundamentally different conception of what Liberalism stood for,"" said the publisher's biographer Ross Harness, who added that occasionally the Star had to reverse a policy it was advocating to conform with announcements from Ottawa. A further complicating factor was Atkinson's occasionally stormy relationship with some of the paper's major stockholders who had bought the paper - and hired Atkinson - to help the Liberals breach the ramparts of Tory Toronto. These wealthy men loudly remonstrated if any editorial position adopted by Atkinson offended them or hurt their business interests. Undeterred, Atkinson launched a bare-knuckled crusade in 1905 against price-fixers who exploited tariff laws and unfairly profited from the sale of everything from clothing and food to plumbing supplies. The crusade lasted five years and resulted in legislation aimed at breaking up secret price-fixing cartels. Excessive profits made headlines again during the Great War of 194-18, when Canadian soldiers fought and died on Europe's battlefields. Sixty thousand Canadians never returned, and thousands of widows struggled to raise their fatherless children with little support. Amid this misery, some businessmen made fortunes profiteering on lucrative war contracts, leading the publisher to increase his calls for an excess profits tax. His reasoning was simple: Exorbitant war profits should be taxed to help pay for social benefits that he believed were a basic right of all Canadians . . . or the excess profits should be returned to workers in the form of higher wages. To the publisher's delight, an excess profits tax was announced in 1916 by the wartime Union government of Sir Robert Borden. Laurier - who believed free enterprise was entitled to its profits - felt such a tax was inexcusable. He opposed the publisher's strong editorial stand on the issue, and a major dispute broke out between the two men. ""I am sorry to say that we are at the very antipodes on this question,"" the Liberal Party leader wrote Atkinson in 1916, adding: ""I do not think it would be advisable further to carry on this discussion between us . . ."" Atkinson's push for a fairer redistribution of Canada's riches - and social justice for all - was a centrepiece of his newspaper's editorial policy from the beginning, and was relentlessly pushed forward by the Star publisher.

"Everyone must be equal under the law, and able to enjoy the fundamental freedoms of belief, thought, expression and the press.  The Social Crusades of Joseph Atkinson,  Joseph Atkinson's crusading journalism made him powerful friends and foes. In the early 1900s, workers applauded his support for unions and their right to strike for higher wages. Businessmen disliked his insistence that all public utilities should be owned by the public. When labour unrest erupted in Canada following the end of World War I,   publisher advocated far-reaching social reforms as the best defence against the threat of Bolshevism. ""Law and order must be maintained. But more is required. We must build up a social system that . . . is better than Bolshevism. We must not allow conditions to be maintained or to arrive which will cause discontent and pile up the inflammable material on which the flames of Bolshevism may feed,"" said a 1919 editorial. The viewpoint aroused suspicion among the wealthy elite. Powerful businessmen were already unhappy with the Star's calls for an excess profits tax, and the paper's relentless push for social reforms such as old-age pensions, unemployment insurance and mothers' allowances. When   also began to vocally support minimum wages, the eight-hour day, and labour having a bigger voice in Parliament, the paper came to be seen by some critics as showing a ""Bolshevistic trend."" This view hardened in the late 1920s when the paper engaged in a spirited defence of free speech and the right of public assembly, at a time when police roughly broke up meetings in the parks with gas, batons and mounted police charges. The paper's belief in the free public expression of opinions led to accusations that   was sympathetic with Communism. The paper dismissed all such suggestions, made principally by newspaper rivals and, with a jab at   , declared in 1929: "" . . . This paper steadily adheres to liberal principles, believes in democracy and has no more use for Communism or the Reds than the Tories' morning newspaper."" The paper also aggressively fought racial religious bigory, the growing power of Toronto's police force, and mass deportations of immigrants from across Canada who became ill, unemployed or were otherwise seen as undesirable.  publisher personally opposed capital punishment, a view that was reinforced after spending a night in a death-watch with a hangman and then covering the grisly execution of a condemned murderer the following day. The hangman was John Radclive, a steward at the Sunnyside Boating Club of Toronto. He executed murderers as a sideline. On the eve of the execution, the hangman told Atkinson: ""I shall carry it out as strict and stern as if I was shooting a dog . . ."" But the execution of murderer Reginald Birchall was hideously botched. It took the condemned man 18 minutes to die of strangulation. Under Atkinson,   became a forum for a lenghty debate on capital punishment. One faction in Canada believed there was too much ""maudlin sympathy for desperate criminals"" and that the gallows was ""a necessary deterrent,"" while another faction argued that crime - even when culminating in murder - should be treated like any other disease.   wavered on capital punishment for a half century under the publisher. Some editorials and stories tended to favour a more humane treatment of criminals and supported a system of parole for convicts who, after serving prison terms, had demonstrated they had learned the errors of their ways and were able to re-enter society as good citizens. Other editorials and stories tended to support the death penalthy but expressed the view that if hangings of murderers had to continue, the executions should be conducted out of the public eye.

"We support proper city planning, the development of strong communities with vibrant local fabrics and the active involvement of citizens in civic affairs.  The Social Crusades of Joseph E. Atkinson,  Joseph E. Atkinson was a lifelong promoter of city planning. ""Toronto is going to be a big city . . . we should begin to shape things accordingly,"" he declared in a 1900 Star editorial. Under the publisher's watchful eye, Star editorials and news stories waged lavish crusades against ""the forces of Muddy Yorkism and civic stagnation,"" and prodded city fathers to find the necessary confidence and vision to improve the ""great, growing city."" He also wanted planners to put a stamp of beauty on the features of Toronto. During a half century, his newspaper fought to save trees, open more parks, create boulevards, save beaches, improve roads, encourage more beautiful architecture, improve street lights, purify water, build a sea wall, protect and develop the CNE, raise building standards, and encourage affordable housing.   just as enthusiastically waged war against urban sprawl, short-sighted planning, and a massive waterfront ""land grab"" that would have had disastrous consequences for Toronto's citizens today. In 1909, an editorial that called for a big improvement to the waterfront seemed to sum up the publisher's position on the need for bold and imaginative planning: Toronto's explosive growth led   to predict in 1901 what the city would be like in 2001. The paper saw Toronto's population soaring from 200,000 to 6 million people with the city extending to take in Whitby, Uxbridge, Brampton and Oakville.

"A Law Society of Ontario service that deals with harassment and discrimination by lawyers and paralegals saw a 50 per cent increase in complaints in the first half of 2018 compared to the last six months of 2017. “I believe we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg,” said lawyer Lai-King Hum, one of the individuals who serve as discrimination and harassment counsel (DHC). The free service is funded by the legal regulator but operates independently of it. “I believe there’s now probably going to be a consistent level (of complaints.)” The service’s mandate is to deal with allegations, both from the public and from members of the legal profession, that are based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Ontario Human Rights Code, including sex, race and sexual orientation.  The service says in its latest report that 125 individuals reached out with a new issue between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2018, averaging about 21 “new contacts” per month.  Of those 125 individuals, 46 complaints fell within the program’s mandate: 45 related to lawyers’ conduct and one related to the conduct of an articling student. The remaining 79 complaints dealt with matters outside the program’s mandate, such as complaints about individuals other than lawyers and paralegals. A portion of these complaints were related to members of the legal profession but dealt with matters other than human rights code grounds, such as complaints about abusive work environments, many of which were made by articling students. “The behaviours they reported included not being given legal work; being forced to run personal errands for their articling principal and/or their principal’s family; being subjected to verbal abuse and threats; not being paid; being paid less than minimum wage; verbally abusing and/or humiliating students in front of other lawyers/clients; and bullying,” the report states.  “A disproportionate number of the students reporting abusive employment relationships are students who received their training outside Canada ... or racialized students. While these matters fall outside the mandate of the DHC, they are significant enough a trend that they warrant being brought to the law society’s attention.”  The report points to a number of possible reasons for the spike in complaints this year.  “The number of contacts to the DHC office increased noticeably beginning in the fall of 2017 as the #MeToo movement emerged,” the report states. “That higher level of contact has been sustained, with a number of callers citing the #MeToo movement as giving them confidence to come forward to report.”  The report also points to a November 2017 story in the Globe and Mail by Hadiya Roderique, about her experiences as a Black female lawyer, that was widely read in the legal community. Of the 45 complaints about lawyers that fell within the program’s mandate, 34 were made by members of the legal profession:  Twenty-eight of those 34 complaints, representing 80 per cent, were made by women, more than half of whom identified as racialized and/or a person with a disability. Six of the 34 complaints were made by men, all but one of whom identified as “being racialized, and/or of a minority religion, gay or a man with a disability,” according to the report.  The remaining 11 complaints about lawyers were made by members of the public. “I think it’s a very important role that we play,” Hum said. “Even if people are not prepared to take any actual action about harassment or discrimination that they’ve faced, the fact that they provide us with the information will help us to determine how much of a problem there is in the profession. Without the data, it’s hard to say.” Services provided by the discrimination and harassment counsel program include coaching for individuals who want to handle a harassment situation by themselves, facilitating mediation and advising complainants of other avenues of recourse, including filing a formal complaint of misconduct with the law society against a lawyer or paralegal. The complaints about lawyers that fell within the program’s mandate include sexual harassment, such as “predatory texting, persistent unwanted contact outside of work, including late night phone calls; sexual advances and persistent pressuring of complainant(s) for sexual relationships; disparaging women in front of colleagues.” There were also complaints from female members of the profession about being pressured to return early from maternity leave, as well as reprisals for having taken it in the first place.  Others complained of racial harassment, including verbal and physical threats, and systemic racism “in which racialized lawyers and students were denied opportunities for mentorship; denied access to desirable work, and assigned work that was non-legal work or work below their level.”  Hum said the program is reviewing its mandate to become more proactive, “such as providing education to law firms, going in and explaining what discrimination and harassment is, and what steps they can take.”  ",0,Law society program sees spike in harassment complaints in wake of #MeToo movement
"The rights of working people include freedom of association, safety and dignity in the workplace.  The Social Crusades of Joseph Atkinson,  ""Prosperity must bless all . . ."" For 50 years, Joseph Atkinson was a champion of workers, many thousands of whom suffered ""hunger and despair"" when Toronto was plunged into successive depressions. The Star publisher sought changes to the capitalist system that he believed made a few Canadians extremely rich, while thousands lived in abject misery. News stories told of families left without money for food and rent during economic downturns. ""Yesterday somebody called and found the children and mother crying from hunger and cold. Do you know those people hadn't one spark of fire in their house,"" recounted a typical report in 1908. The Star launched its own fund ""to fight hunger and want,"" and urged readers to contribute. It also pressed the city to provide snow-cleaning jobs and unemployment relief. Later, in 1914, editorials began to call for changes to the capital system ""so that people shall not starve or freeze, forgotten by their neighbors, or live in such deprivation that disease and death will hunt them out and dispose of them one by one or in dozens . . ."" The welfare of workers was a primary concern of Joseph Atkinson, though initial attempts to organize reporters and editors at his own newspaper were frustrated for several years. (He reportedly feared any agreement that did not included the Globe and Telegram would put the Star at a competitive disadvantage, and he insisted on joint negotiations). Throughout his life, Atkinson supported minimum wages, the eight-hour day, better working conditions, technical schools and night university for workers wishing to advance, the right of workers to strike for higher pay, and the right of workes to join the union of their choice, workers' compensation, and employment for the handicapped. But of his many campaigns on behalf of workers, perhaps the greatest was the long struggle for unemployment insurance. ",0,Rights of Working People
"The first indication the Star got that all was not well in  was a tweet from the Toronto Police Operations Centre: “Collision, numerous pedestrians have been struck by a white van on Yonge St and Finch area. further when I get more.”  It was 1:30 p.m. and reporter Jenna Moon was monitoring the Toronto police twitter account. As soon as she saw the tweet, she says, she knew this was big and immediately ran to alert her supervisor, Ed Tubb, an assignment editor on the Star’s breaking news team.  Tubb asked Moon to write a short article with what little information she had. While she did that, Patrick Ho, the rewrite editor on the digital team, began monitoring breaking news channels for the latest information, while the Star’s team of web editors prepared to push breaking news alerts on all of the Star’s digital platforms. “They were all on the story within 30 seconds of seeing that tweet — there was a lot of controlled yelling in the newsroom,” recalled Tubb.  Moon’s first story on the incident explaining that police said there were between eight and 10 pedestrians struck by a white van was posted online at 1:41 p.m. Tubb, fellow assignment editor Amber Shortt and their manager, breaking news/enterprise editor Amit Shilton, dispatched reporters Victoria Gibson and Tamar Harris to the scene. “It’s tough in the first hour, when we don’t know yet know the extent of what’s happened. The first thing is to get reporters on the scene fast,” said Tubb. In addition to those in the Star newsroom, Metroland and StarMetro reporters responded. Metroland’s Andrew Palamarchuk and Aaron D’Andrea, were among the first reporters on scene. One shaken witness who said he briefly followed the van told Palamarchuk: “This is not an accident.” “You look back now and yes, it’s pretty obvious,” said Patrick Ho, who kept the breaking news story up-to-date online Monday. “But amid the first minutes of a developing story, we need to make sure. For all we know, without verification, it could have been a case of medical distress.” At the south end of the 2.2-kilometre stretch of Yonge that had been cordoned off by police, Gibson and Harris interviewed witnesses and police officers, sending their files back to the Star and posting what they were learning on social media. Star reporters Jesse McLean and Moira Welsh also went to the scene, walking south from Finch on sidestreets and behind buildings on Yonge, interviewing witnesses who were in shops and restaurants when the rampage began. Welsh spoke to a woman who worked in a restaurant close to Finch who gave her an account of a young woman lying on the sidewalk with two men performing CPR on her. Star photographers René Johnston, Steve Russell and Lucas Oleniuk were dispatched to different areas of the scene. In Johnston’s case, he rushed to Yonge and Sheppard from another assignment at High Park. Coincidentally, Johnston knew that area of North York well because his grandfather used to live close by. Johnston raced on foot toward North York City Centre, which is just north of Mel Lastman Square, where according to initial reports several people had been hit. Sadly, this proved to be true.  Yonge St. had been closed to traffic, so to get close, Johnston entered the area from the west via Beecroft Road, which runs parallel to Yonge, and ran east to the Starbucks on the northeast corner of the square. From there, at 2:23 p.m., he snapped a photo of firefighters and police placing an orange tarp over the body of a victim. A single shoe and some items of clothing rest in the foreground. The picture ran as main art on the front page the next day.  Kathy English, the Star’s public editor, said that it is imperative the Star gets it right, even when news is breaking fast. “In any breaking news situation, so much misinformation circulates,” English said. “There was a lot of speculation about terrorism. These are the kinds of situations where we have the opportunity to show the role of real news. We take that responsibility very seriously — giving readers facts, not rumours.” As the team on the scene scrambled for information, the digital desk was in overdrive looking for photos on social media and keeping thestar.com and other platforms up-to-date. It was a difficult task given the abundance of unconfirmed information being reported on social media, and the fact that the number of dead and injured kept changing.  “We did our best to comb through social media, particularly Twitter to find photos we could use but that proved difficult,” said deputy digital editor Sabrina Melchiori. “An abundance of caution was necessary to avoid the spread of misinformation.” About 5:30 p.m., CBS News reported that sources had identified the suspect in the rampage as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill. As soon as she heard this, the Star’s social media producer, Evelyn Kwong, searched LinkedIn, found a profile she thought could be Minassian’s and saved his photo. “We had a LinkedIn account with a guy that said he went to Seneca, but we didn’t have anybody who knew him who could confirm that his photo is him. That was the problem. We had both these things but no independent confirmation linking the two,” explained Shilton.  Reporter Harris was dispatched to Richmond Hill to see if she could locate Minassian’s home in an effort to confirm his identity. Meanwhile, crime reporter Wendy Gillis worked sources to confirm what the CBS network in the U.S. was reporting and that the photo from LinkedIn was in fact Minassian. Once it was confirmed, a breaking news alert email at 7:48 p.m. told Star readers that a police source had identified the suspect as Minassian.

"Saying efforts to narrow the gender wage gap are not working, the Ontario government will soon force firms to disclose salary ranges in jobs ads and also report to the province what they pay their employees.  In legislation aimed at lowering a difference that is as high as 30 per cent in some sectors — a figure that has not budged in the last decade — the Ontario government plans to have business track wages and break them down by gender and diversity to help rectify what the labour minister called a reality that’s “simply unfair to women.” “We have a 29 per cent gender wage gap in the province of Ontario — despite other attempts at trying to solve that issue ... we are not making the progress that we need to make sure that women are an equal partner, are empowered in the economy, are earning the same as men,” Kevin Flynn told reporters Tuesday. “... We’ve got some of the best pay equity legislation in the world, our enforcement isn’t perhaps what it should be, and we’ve asked business to come along on a voluntary basis, we’ve asked them to comply with the number of women on boards, in leadership roles — and it just isn’t working,” he added. “We need something a lot more firm than that.” Based on legislation in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, the Ontario proposal — a first in Canada — should help narrow the gap to about 15 or 16 per cent, he said. “It’s a change that’s long, long overdue,” added Flynn. “Whether you are a big business or a small business, women in this province really deserve better.” Critics wondered why the Liberals, in power for 15 years, are only now taking action. “If it were a priority for Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals, they would have already done it,” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, adding that Liberals “have not even been able to ensure pay equity within the government.” “Sadly, they have not, and today’s announcement does not improve the pay equity outlook for Ontario’s women,” Horwath said. “In fact, experts are saying Kathleen Wynne’s desperate attempt to win votes before the June provincial election is actually a step back for women in Ontario.” The NDP’s Cindy Forster (Welland) called it “weak legislation.”  The move, announced by Premier Wynne earlier Tuesday — two days before International Women’s Day — means job candidates will have information about compensation when applying for and accepting jobs. It’s part of a broader, $50 million three-year plan that will ban employers from asking potential workers about what they’ve earned in the past, and report publicly on wages. “We’ve got to pay attention to the reality of women’s lives,” Wynne said. “They still are not paid the same as men are paid. They still, at a very young age, have their horizons limited. We have got to stop doing that to them.” The funding will also go towards job skills training and supports at women’s centres, boosting mentorship and entrepreneurship. The proposed rules will at first be applied to the Ontario Public Service, then to companies with 500-plus employees, followed by firms with 250-plus workers.  The legislation is expected to pass before the writ drops in May, and will come into force in January 2019. Businesses that don’t comply could face fines.

"Taped to the glass about halfway up a window in the Star’s radio room is a memo titled, “How to write a weather story.” It’s a handy guide the Star’s  turn to whenever apocalyptic weather hits the GTA, like last weekend when our surroundings became something that looked more like a scene from the Disney movie Frozen than crocus season. The guide, written by one of the Star’s digital producers Natasha Grzincic, lays out who to call in the event of bad weather, what websites and social media accounts to monitor, and when to update the story for the website. It also contains some general suggestions about writing style (conversational! It’s the weather after all!). “The idea is to write about how the weather affects people, while making sure we are providing them with information that is accurate and up to date,” said Grzincic, who was in charge of thestar.com on Sunday. The job of reporters who work in the radio room is to keep readers up-to-date on  , including traffic problems, public transit delays or flight cancellations. Weather conditions can play a role in how the city runs, so it’s imperative Star reporters get information fast and get it right. The ice storm of April 14 and 15 provides an opportunity to take a look at how we do that.  It started on Saturday morning, before the real deluge of freezing rain and gusting winds arrived. Weekend staff reporters Tamar Harris and Ben Spurr were assigned the task of updating an existing Canadian Press wire story published on thestar.com that forecast the inclement weather. Harris checked with Environment Canada, which was warning that the ice storm could be “historic” in some parts of southern Ontario, and surveyed the websites and Twitter feeds of GTA universities and colleges to check for closures. Spurr then updated the story with information the TTC had released about service changes as a result of the storm, and called Toronto Police and the Ontario Provincial Police for the latest updates on the number of collisions in the city. He reached out to Toronto Raptors owner Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment to confirm rumours that the tailgate party in Maple Leaf Square, also known as “Jurassic Park,” for that evening’s playoff game, would be cancelled. Meanwhile, Star photographers Andrew Francis Wallace and Bernard Weil filed photos showing the effects of the storm. At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alexandra Jones arrived for her shift, and immediately checked Environment Canada’s website to get an up-to-date forecast, and continued to check road conditions with police.  “At the start of my shift on Saturday, there had been over 200 collisions reported by the OPP. By the end of my shift, there were over 550,” she recalled. When she finished work at midnight, Jones passed the   to radio room reporter Bryann Aguilar, who was working the overnight shift. Early Sunday morning, his updated story, which included warnings that freezing rain and heavy rain were headed Toronto’s way, was published online. At around 9:30 a.m. Sunday, Annie Arnone, the morning radio room reporter, updated the story to include comments from a Toronto Police spokeswoman who urged the public to stay indoors if possible and to drive slowly if going out. At 10:45 a.m., Mayor John Tory held a media briefing, during which he explained that many streets had not been plowed because of concerns that large amounts of slush on the sides of roads would increase the risk of flooding. This necessitated another update, with the mayor’s comments leading the story. “I think I updated the same file six or seven times in one shift, which is crazy,” said Arnone. During the day, photographers Weil and Rene Johnston braved the outdoors trying to capture numerous photos. At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alanna Rizza, arrived for her shift, and immediately started working on a   of the effects of the storm, including the number of vehicle collisions, TTC delays, flight cancellations and power outages.  “A challenge was that the number of people affected by the ice storm kept changing. Initially, we reported that about 7,000 customers in Toronto were without power, but that number kept growing throughout the evening,” Rizza said. To keep on top of the power outages, Rizza monitored Toronto Hydro’s website, which provides regular updates through a map. Barry Brimbecom, the assignment editor over the weekend, said the key to good weather coverage is ensuring readers have all the necessary information to plan their lives. “We need to tell readers where the streetcar tracks are frozen, if their flight might be cancelled, or where the highways are closed,” he said. “We can help keep people safe, too. When the police are telling anyone who can that they should stay home, I want to know that — and the Star provides that link between them and our readers.” ",0,How the Star covers a spring ice storm
"Reporters who cover Ontario’s justice system have long lamented the lack of transparency they can encounter while navigating the courts.  Courts are supposed to be open to the public — and that includes bail hearings, trials and appeals, as well as records filed in cases. (While the courts are presumptively open, there are certain aspects of procedures that are subject to publication bans, it should be noted). But whether it’s obtaining copies of documents, exhibits, or transcripts, the reporter’s job of keeping the public apprised of what goes on in our courtrooms can be a challenging, and often frustrating, task. Case in point: reporter Tamar Harris’s recent trip to the Oshawa courthouse to cover the court appearance of two Durham Regional Police Service officers facing assault charges. Cst. James Edward Scholtes and Cst. Thomas Broadfoot were each charged with assault causing bodily harm, obstruction of justice and obstructing a peace officer after they pulled over a vehicle in Oshawa on April 26, 2017. According to the Special Investigations Unit, an arm’s length agency which is called in to investigate reports of police involvement in deaths, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault, the officers arrested the 35-year-old passenger and took him to the police station. A short time later, the man was taken to hospital by ambulance suffering a serious injury. Harris was dispatched to the Oshawa courthouse on March 22, 2018, when the lawyer for the officers was making a court appearance, in an effort to learn the name of the alleged victim (the SIU doesn’t typically release victims’ names). Harris arrived at 9:30 a.m. and went straight to the courtroom to wait for the officers’ appearance. She was also hoping to see the court file in order to find out the name of the alleged victim. The case came before the judge two hours later, at 11:30 a.m., but went on recess shortly after. After the recess, Harris approached the court clerk and requested to see the file. The clerk said she’d have to wait until the next recess, as there wasn’t time to allow her to see the file. Harris returned to her seat and waited through the next block of appearances by others charged with various offences unrelated to the police officers’ case. After these cases were heard, Harris again approached the clerk to ask to see the file, but was told she would have leave the courtroom immediately because the court was going on recess again. At this point, Harris had been at the courthouse for more than three hours. “It’s essential to have the file on hand when writing the story,” Harris said in an interview. “Having that file means you have all the official information and can, perhaps most importantly, fact-check properly. Making sure we get a story right is the most important part of doing our job as journalists, and having that documentation is key to that.” When the courtroom opened back up an hour later, Harris approached the clerk again with a request to see the file. This time, the clerk allowed her to see it, but only for about three minutes, as the judge was returning any moment. Luckily, that gave her just enough time to find the alleged victim’s name, but nothing else. She was told she would have to wait until the file was returned to the file room at the end of the day before she could get a paper copy. Harris spent the next hour doing research and pulling files on other cases while she waited for the police officers’ file to be delivered to the file room. At around 4:30 p.m. she started to get worried, knowing that the file room closed half an hour later and the file still hadn’t been returned. At 5 p.m., the file room closed, and Harris wasn’t able to get a copy.  “I don’t think we should accept a system where a journalist can spend eight hours in a courthouse and not get a copy of the file they went there for,” Harris said. “In the end, it is detrimental to freedom of information if a public document is not publicly accessible.” Brian Gray, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General, said the duties for court staff when Harris was there “were particularly lengthy that day as there were hundreds of matters addressed in the relevant courtroom.”  He said it was “unfortunate” that the file had not yet been returned to the administration office before it closed but that it was open for the reporter “to return to the court, or send a representative, to obtain a copy of the file the following morning.” ",0,How a Star reporter was stymied in her attempts to get public court records
". A great many public-interest stories that have appeared in the Toronto Star were the result of Freedom-of-Information requests made by journalists to government ministries, organizations and agencies. Readers will often see phrases like “according to documents obtained through a Freedom-of-Information request,” or “documents uncovered through access-to-information legislation reveal ...” in stories about decisions our institutions make behind closed doors. But what doesn’t get reported is the usually painstaking process journalists go through in an attempt to get the information. First they have to figure out exactly what to ask for. This is often followed by months-long — or sometimes years-long — delays and fights over the often high fees charged. Freedom-of-Information legislation gives members of the public who pay a $5 fee the right to ask municipal, provincial and federal governments for almost any kind information these institutions hold, with some exceptions. There are usually further fees for the time spent searching for the requests and making copies. Requesters unhappy with the cost, the amount of time the request is taking, or the responsiveness of the government, can appeal to provincial and federal information and privacy commissioners for assistance. But this process can add months to an already slow process. Journalists who use the system regularly have been complaining for years that the Freedom-of-Information system is broken, but little has been done by governments that has made it more accessible. The recent travails of city hall reporter Jennifer Pagliaro, during her quest to uncover information from the City of Toronto about the controversial Scarborough subway extensions, show the lengths the media, as representatives of the public, have to go through to get information that is the property of the public. In mid-2015, Pagliaro requested emails, memos, and other documents from the time council   a light-rail line fully funded by the province to when council made the decision to build a subway instead. “It’s so hard to get at the truth with issues like the Scarborough subway. There is so little evidence to justify building it and also a lot of misinformation. That makes it difficult to know if politicians are spending our money wisely,” Pagliaro said. “Are they doing it based on the facts or because of political motivations? Freedom of information laws are one of the ways we try to shed light on issues like a controversial subway project.” City staff told Pagliaro that her request would cover thousands of emails and asked her to consider narrowing the requested search, which was for “Scarborough subway” and “Scarborough LRT.” She did not change her request. A month later, the city told Pagliaro its estimated fee for the information was $1,755, and that it needed a nine-month extension because staff whose records she had requested were too busy. (At the City of Toronto, staff whose records are requested must do their own searches, as opposed to Freedom-of-Information co-ordinators who do this at other government institutions.) Pagliaro paid the $877.50 deposit (50 per cent of total fee estimate, as is required by law) but at the same time appealed the fee and the delay to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.  During the appeal process, the city lowered its fee estimate to $1,485 but requested an additional year to fulfil the request.  After nearly a year of back-and-forth discussions with the commissioner’s office and waiting for a resolution, the commissioner ruled the city could have four more months to respond to Pagliaro’s request and that the fee estimate was reasonable.  Despite that ruling, however, the final batch of records was delivered to Pagliaro two weeks late. In all, it took nearly two years to get all of the records requested. Among the revelations contained in the records: Prior to council’s July 2013 vote to approve the multibillion-dollar Scarborough subway, former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat tried but failed to convince her colleagues behind-the-scenes that the fully-funded seven-stop light-rail line was still the best plan. “It concerns me that a system purporting to be designed to allow access to public information was set up to be incredibly onerous on the person seeking that information,” Pagliaro said. “The result is often legislated secrecy.” The Star’s managing editor Irene Gentle adds the issue is bad enough for members of the press, “But this system is meant for everyone. The government is asking citizens not used to the system to try to navigate it with months or years of delays, mounting costs and appeals. The cost is public information remaining secret. That’s a dangerous thing.” ",0,What it takes to get the results of a Freedom-of-Information request
". A North York school that students can see from their apartment balconies but can’t attend. A cluster of modern waterfront condos in Etobicoke surrounded by traffic-clogged roads. Cars, trucks, streetcars and buses competing for space along crawling downtown streets during rush hour. These are just a few of the challenges of living in an increasingly crowded city that the Star has explored in its Growing Pains series — a weekly examination of the impacts density is having on our ability to live, work, play and get around in Toronto.  Spearheaded by Doug Cudmore, senior editor in beats, bureaus and columnists, the project grew out of a newsroom discussion involving several editors and reporters late last year about how the Star could highlight the city’s housing issues. Common themes emerged from the discussion, such as affordability and livability. But the team decided to focus on density, and how the city deals with it, as it is one of the issues that most impacts our quality of life.  The team decided to highlight how various Toronto neighbourhoods were being affected by increasing density — and ways to make things better. But where to start? Various beat reporters, namely Education Reporter Andrea Gordon, Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr, Real Estate Reporter Tess Kalinowski and City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro were asked to help map out potential areas of coverage.  Former intern reporter Alex McKeen (now a reporter for Metro News in Vancouver), helped kick off the series with a story that delved into census data to identify areas that were intensifying rapidly. She compared the number of people per hectare in each census tract between 2011 and 2016. What she found was some neighbourhoods, such as Liberty Village and Humber Bay Shores, were intensifying at rates many times the city’s average. Her research culminated in a   on how developments are popping up across the GTA, often without sufficient access to transit, parks and schools. Cudmore says he believes a lot of the problems facing Toronto aren’t due to density per se, but rather the fact that the city has a tendency to address density in “easy, profitable” ways, such as building more housing, while pushing the harder planning challenges further into the future.  “Think of the great upheaval we felt this winter as the city closed King St. W. to through traffic,” Cudmore says. “We have to get those overstuffed streetcars through, in large part because we suddenly built a dense neighbourhood in Liberty Village, but we didn’t quite build the transit capacity to deal with them. That’s not likely just going to be a one-off.” When it comes to figuring out which services need to be addressed, the team relies on beat reporters who have spent months or years building contacts and observing changes in their areas of coverage. To show how density is impacting how we educate our children, Education Reporter Andrea Gordon delved deeper into the Yonge and Sheppard area, where residents had been complaining for years about how their kids couldn’t go to the most nearby school. She wanted to give a first-hand look at the situation,   of children in a North York highrise condominium who can look out over McKee Public School next door but can’t attend. That’s because the school is at 110 per cent capacity (the school has doubled in size to almost 800 students in the last 10 years). Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr knew residents of Etobicoke’s Humber Bay Shores, made up of modern condo towers close to Lake Ontario, had been advocating for a new GO Train station nearby. He wrote   on the need to help alleviate its roadways that are clogged with traffic every weekday morning due to a poorly planned transportation network. “Issues like municipal zoning bylaws and appeals at the Ontario Municipal Board may sound boring on their face, but they have a dramatic effect on the daily lives of citizens,” Spurr says. “I think what we were trying to get at with this series is how small decisions taken — or not taken — by local leaders can snowball and create huge problems for residents years down the line. The local government then needs to go back in and try to fix a problem that wouldn’t have been nearly as severe if collectively we’d exercised some forethought in the first place.” Cudmore echoes Spurr’s assessment.  “One of the goals of this series is to tie together a few strands of urban frustration and to show readers that they were related,” he said. “The other was to look for solutions and give them some air; for instance, Andrea’s piece spelled out clearly how funding regulations meant that some kids might never get a chance to go to their neighbourhood school. There are changes that can be made on those fronts.” Cudmore stresses Growing Pains isn’t about NIMBYism or fighting density. “It’s the opposite of that. But if we don’t address the details of density, it’s a change that might not last.” ",0,How the Star’s Growing Pains series aims to offer solutions amid growing urban density
"When the Star learns about an individual charged by Ontario police with high-profile crimes, reporters will often contact the Ministry of the Attorney General, police and court record offices to find out if the accused has any prior convictions.  In the case of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, the Star did just that and learned from the ministry that in 2003, McArthur had been convicted of one count of assault causing bodily harm and one count of assault with a weapon in relation to an incident two years prior. He was handed a conditional sentence of two years less and day and put on probation for three years.  The Star  . In early February, legal affairs reporter Jacques Gallant asked the ministry if there were any audio recordings from McArthur’s 2003 case. Gallant was curious to know what arguments were made by McArthur’s lawyers, the Crown attorney prosecuting the case, and whether or not McArthur spoke in court.  That seemingly simple request began what was to become a convoluted and frustrating odyssey through red tape as Gallant attempted to report on the proceeding. Initially, the Ministry of the Attorney General told Gallant that staff at Old City Hall courthouse could find no recordings related to McArthur from 2003. Then, a week later, on Feb. 16, the ministry emailed Gallant to say that in fact there were recordings — one from January 2003, in which McArthur entered a guilty plea, and one from April 2003 for McArthur’s sentencing hearing. To access them, Gallant would need permission from the presiding judge and a court order. He was told this is judicial policy for recordings made prior to April 15, 2013. Since then, the introduction of digital recording devices has made recorded in-court proceedings easier to share with the media. A ministry spokesperson said the ministry “recognizes that Ontario’s court system is based on the fundamental principles of openness and accessibility.” In this case, because the presiding judge had retired, Gallant had to ask the local administrative judge at Old City Hall for the order. That judge wasn’t available for another five days.  On Feb. 21, Gallant finally got his day in court to ask for the recordings. The judge didn’t know if there were any publication bans on the 2003 proceedings and delayed her decision while court staff checked. Later that day, once it was confirmed there were no publication bans, the Crown said he could prepare a draft order that night for the judge to sign the following day. On Feb. 22, Gallant was told he could go to the courthouse to listen to the tapes or receive copies. The option he chose would have to be specified on the court order. He asked the Crown for copies, figuring it would be more convenient, and signed an agreement that he would not disseminate the recordings or let anyone else listen to them.  At around 2:30 p.m. that day, Gallant got word his request had been granted. He jumped in a cab and raced to the court reporters’ office at Old City Hall. Once there, he had to wait half an hour while copies were made.  But instead of providing the recordings of the 2003 McArthur proceedings on CD, the court reporters’ office gave him two cassette tapes. Gallant would need a Sony BM-246, a special tape recorder used in court, to listen to them.  “It’s like this massive machine straight out of the ’80s. We certainly did not have one of those at the Star and I wasn’t really sure where we’d get one,” Gallant said. Trying another approach, Gallant’s editor, Matt Carter, sent out a mass email to Star staff asking: “Does anyone in the newsroom have a standard, 1980s-style cassette player on hand? (Or in their car?)” “Colleagues started coming forward with cassette players caked in dust that had literally been sitting on their desks for years,” said Gallant.  After about half an hour, a working cassette player was found. However, Gallant said the voices on the recordings sounded like chipmunks and were unintelligible. By then it was 6 p.m., just three hours from deadline and editors were keen to get the story if there was compelling material on the recordings.  Free audio software found on the internet proved to be the ticket. It slowed the audio on the tapes so Gallant could understand what was said in court.  Gallant began furiously transcribing. By 8:30 p.m. he had filed a   in 2003. The story revealed, among other things, that McArthur himself went to police shortly after he attacked a man on Halloween 2001. The next day, Feb. 23, Gallant transcribed the recording of McArthur’s second 2003 court appearance — the sentencing hearing. The tape revealed the Crown’s reasoning for wanting to bar McArthur from the Gay Village and stay away from sex workers. The story also included a quote from  . “Courts are supposed to be open to the public. Yet even as a journalist who regularly covers courts, it was very difficult to get access to these recordings,” Gallant said. “I can’t imagine what a member of the public would have to go through to get access to this kind of a record.” ",0,The red tape behind the Bruce McArthur tapes
"Two and a half years ago, an adjudicator for the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario upheld a decision by the Toronto Police Services Board to neither confirm nor deny that the force had acquired cellphone data-capturing devices known as IMSI catchers, or Stingrays.  That decision came following a Freedom-of-Information request made by an unidentified citizen in an attempt to find out if the police had purchased the technology. In his  , Information and Privacy Commissioner adjudicator Donald Hale wrote the disclosure of this information “could reasonably be expected to reveal investigative techniques which are either in use or could likely be used in law enforcement.” Four months later, in an  , Ontario Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish said it was not apparent to him that the public interest was given full consideration by the adjudicator. “Were we to have another appeal, I think it could lead to a different conclusion, let me put it that way,” Beamish said at the time. That remarkable response prompted Star reporters Wendy Gillis, Kate Allen and Jayme Poisson to file their own Freedom-of-Information requests (later reduced to one) asking for confirmation of whether or not Toronto police use the technology. This, despite the fact a Toronto police spokesperson had told the Star in 2015: “We do not use the Stingray technology and do not have one of the units.” IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, or Stingrays, work by imitating cell towers thereby forcing phones within a certain range to connect to them. The devices are controversial because they are indiscriminate in targeting mobile phones. This means unique identifying cellphone data from innocent citizens in the vicinity of the police’s target is also collected. “I think all three of us were picking up on the fact that there was this technology that police may — or may not — be using that could suck up a ton of personal data alongside the information they needed,” said Gillis in an interview. “It seemed unbelievable that they would be able to do this and not tell the public about it, meaning there could be no oversight or rights safeguards.” But getting clarity would become a two-year saga for the reporters.  Police initially missed the 30-day deadline that institutions are given to process Freedom-of-Information requests, so the reporters appealed arguing a missed deadline was a “deemed refusal.” The police eventually responded by saying no responsive records existed and closed the file.  The reporters appealed again, this time to the Information and Privacy Commissioner. In the police response to the Commissioner, it was revealed that no electronic search had actually been conducted. The force had made inquiries with its legal, purchasing, telecom and intelligence departments and apparently confirmed that no records existed. However, they had not done an electronic search because they said they would get a “system error” resulting from too many hits, effectively crashing their computers, and that this would “unreasonably interfere with the operations of the police.” The adjudicator called this justification “untenable” and ordered the police to do a further search.  The reporters then negotiated more narrow wording for their request with the Toronto police Freedom-of-Information co-ordinator in an attempt to speed up the process. This essentially reset the clock on the request, meaning police would be granted another 30 days to respond to the “new” request. Finally, two years after their initial request, the reporters received an answer. Documents showed that Toronto police used the technology in five separate investigations since 2010.  The reporters   on March 5. In the story, Mark Pugash, director of communications for Toronto police, was asked why police initially said they did not use the technology and did nothing to correct the record. He responded: “We should have.” “Part of the problem is that secrecy begets secrecy. In this case, there was no established procedure or expectation that the public would be told about this,” said Gillis. “There is generally a lack of understanding about this tool, and what it is capable of — in part because we don’t know the extent to which it’s being used — that reduces the pressure on police to disclose this information in the first place.” ",0,How the Star finally learned Toronto police used cellphone data-catching devices
"On the afternoon before Valentine’s Day, Theo Moudakis sat down at his desk in his home office and instead of drawing, as one might expect the Toronto Star’s editorial cartoonist to do, he started writing poetry. “Roses are red, I’m serious, dude, slide over close, I wanna collude,” was one poem Moudakis came up with. Here’s another: “I forgot to buy candy and flowers, my sweet, I’ve got an idea, I’ll send you a tweet.” If you haven’t guessed, these were just two of four poems featured in Moudakis’ “Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards”   published on Feb. 14. The first poem accompanies a drawing of Trump with his arm around a bare-chested Vladimir Putin, while the second is written above a picture of Trump on his mobile phone next to his wife, Melania Trump, who is giving her husband the death stare.  The cartoon, a sequel of sorts to Moudakis’ first Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards cartoon   that featured a similar theme, is a recent favourite of the artist. “No cheap shots, nothing nasty, just funny,” says Moudakis, who has been creating editorial cartoons for the Star since 2000. “And it got enough people upset without it turning into an actual controversy. The laugh is always the cartoonist’s most lethal weapon.” Indeed, Moudakis says it’s better to be funny than controversial. “Controversy is overrated. You don’t really want the entire city mad at you. Getting a good laugh always makes for the best cartoon.” That’s not to say some readers won’t find editorial cartoons controversial or distasteful. In fact, controversy can and does play an important role in editorial cartoons. As the Star’s public editor Kathy English wrote in a  , “editorial cartoons are visual commentaries, intended to make a point and make us think. Quite often, the best of them also offend and even infuriate some readers.”  As a commentator, Moudakis, who contributes most of the Star’s editorial cartoons, which appear on the editorial page, has licence to not only express his opinions about any given topic, but also to poke fun at, mock, scorn, taunt, and tease his subjects. Politicians in particular have long found themselves ripe for skewering by the editorial cartoonist’s pen. “In the end, cartoonists aren’t journalists. The rules are different for us. We’re the only ones at a newspaper who don’t deal in facts or fairness, but I make sure to spread the unfairness around evenly,” he says. Where does Moudakis find inspiration? Keeping up-to-date on the latest news is half the battle. His days start early, usually around 5:30 a.m. with a scan of morning news shows, newspapers and websites. By 8 a.m., he’s at his desk sketching ideas by hand, trying out wording and refining the message he wants to send.  “This is the most challenging and really the most thrilling part of the day. There’s nothing like nailing a good idea,” says Moudakis, who quit art school to become a cartoonist.  When he has something he thinks has merit, Moudakis will run it by his boss, editorial page editor Andrew Phillips, for feedback. Moudakis will then draw the final version of the cartoon on paper with a marker, scan it into his computer, and colour it digitally. He’s normally finished by 2 p.m. In the case of the Trump Valentine’s Day cartoon, however, he started a day early in order to come up with four good poems.  “The poems done, I was free to leisurely draw everything the next morning, including all that hand-lettering,” he says. “It was one of those cartoons that was an absolute joy to do from beginning to end.” Patrick Corrigan, who usually contributes the Star’s Saturday editorial cartoon, has a similar process, and says he looks for storylines with long shelf lives, due to the fact that he works ahead a few days. “Over the years I’ve become patient if an idea is slow in coming,” Corrigan explains. “It’s like finding a parking spot downtown. Sometimes you just gotta go ‘round the block a few times.” Corrigan says he gravitates towards social issues, trends and local politics. Last Saturday’s cartoon, for example, humorously combined two current news events — Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party shakeup and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games — to make an observation about the turmoil facing the PCs. The cartoon featured several skiers flying uncontrollably off a long “ .” “I was trying to lend a satirical take on their hapless process, so it was a natural fit to show them flying head over heels off the Olympic ski jump,” says Corrigan, who first joined the Star in 1983 as a staff illustrator. At the end of the day, the job of an editorial cartoonist, says Corrigan, is to speak truth to power in an irreverent, satirical fashion.  “In other words, we hope to make the deserving subject choke on their morning oatmeal when they open their paper.” ",0,"How the Star’s editorial cartoonists turn inspiration into funny, sometimes cutting, social commentary"
"At 9:51 p.m. last Sunday, Toronto Star sports editor Dave Washburn watched as Canada clinched its first gold medal in the Pyeongchang Olympics.  Washburn immediately alerted the news desk of the monumental achievement — a gold medal in the figure skating team event.  Knowing that the Canadian team had a good chance of winning a medal, Washburn had earlier asked senior editors if a later print deadline was possible. Normally, the final print deadline on Sundays is 11 p.m., but this time Washburn was able to secure an extra half-hour. At 10:10 p.m., columnist Rosie DiManno, on assignment in Pyeongchang, South Korea — where it was around noon the next day — filed a 1,000-word piece on how Patrick Chan’s and Gabrielle Daleman’s free skate performances   to the top of the podium. DiManno’s story was quickly edited by the sports desk and sent online at 10:37 p.m. It was laid out for the newspaper and went to press at 11:12 p.m.  The adrenalin-fuelled rush to get the story in the paper is illustrative of the situations Washburn (working in Toronto) and his team in South Korea — columnists DiManno, Bruce Arthur and Dave Feschuk, along with reporter Kerry Gillespie and photographer Steve Russell — have faced daily as they work to keep Star readers up to date on the Games.  Keeping a close eye on developments and anticipating outcomes played a big role in ensuring the Canadian figure skating team’s gold medal made it into print. “We knew on Saturday night the Canadian team was in prime position to win gold, but the expected end time was going to be right after our one and only Sunday print deadline,” said Washburn in an interview. “On Sunday night, we were able to push back the print deadline, which gave us an extra half-hour. When you’re dealing with tight deadlines and not knowing what can happen in the games, those extra minutes matter.” Preparations for the games — getting accreditation for journalists, finding accommodations close to events and determining arrival and departure dates — started a year ago with the help of both the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee.  To know which athletes to watch closely, the team focused on past performances and popularity. For example, the team knew figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir would be popular competitors given their history of medal wins and on-ice chemistry. Washburn says he is also relying on the knowledge of beat reporter Gillespie, who covers amateur sports for the Star, in guiding the newspaper’s coverage. For example, Gillespie recommended following speedskater Kim Boutin, who took the bronze in the women’s 500 metres, and Alex Gough, who took the bronze in women’s singles luge. “We want to make sure we’re at events when there’s a good chance of us hitting the podium,” Washburn said. A few days before the Games began, Washburn started working overnight shifts. And since the opening ceremony, Star web editors have been working day and night to update thestar.com in real time. The 14-hour time difference between South Korea and Toronto wreaks havoc with work hours and sleeping patterns for all involved in the coverage. Print media, by its nature, is not as immediate as television, which affords opportunities to go behind the scenes of the drama to tell stories that aren’t suited to live TV. “Our columnists are some of the best at that. Having the ability to make you chuckle, make you shed a tear perhaps — maybe even make you angry,” Washburn said. For example, earlier this week, Arthur wrote an article about speedskater Ted-Jan Bloemen’s   to his Olympic gold medal victory. In the crowd, his wife was also crying, but because she had just learned of the loss of a friend’s baby. To extend the Star’s coverage, a few reporters in Toronto write a daily roundup of the quirkier goings-on at the Games — gleaned from wire services, Star reporter dispatches and photos. This is labelled “Olympic Notables” and is published on page 2 of the sports section each day. Topics have included the eating habits of athletes, funny or odd utterances by competitors and those covering them, and interesting fashion choices. “We want to give our readers not only the latest Olympic news to the best of our ability, but also provide insight regarding athletes and events so that they come away from our coverage feeling like they have a better, fuller picture of what’s going on,” Washburn said.

"Since Patrick Brown resigned as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives over sexual misconduct allegations just over two weeks ago, the troubles facing the party have been top stories in the Toronto Star every day. The upheaval rocking the official Opposition — which has also seen Rick Dykstra resign as party president in the face of sexual assault allegations, and investigations into suspect membership lists and questionable party spending in the Brown era — has made for a busy time for the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau. Add to that the PC’s rush to elect a new leader ahead of this summer’s provincial election at a time when the sitting Liberals are set to table their 2018 budget, and readers might wonder how the bureau is able to juggle covering all three parties thoroughly and fairly.  “Adrenalin and caffeine help,” says Robert Benzie, the Queen’s Park bureau chief, who along with fellow reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy, and columnist Martin Regg Cohn, work to hold Ontario’s elected officials to account and keep the public informed. In the race to replace Brown, each of the leadership hopefuls — Christine Elliott, Doug Ford and Caroline Mulroney — have their supporters and detractors keenly observing how much press their candidate is getting. “Any one of them could be the next premier of Ontario, so we have to take them all very seriously,” said Benzie in an interview, noting that he strives for equal coverage of all candidates. “It’s early days yet, but for example, there’s a leadership debate next week and we will cover it. It doesn’t mean that every candidate will get exactly the same number of words in the story, but we try to give them equal time.”  The fact that all three leadership candidates have greater-than-usual name recognition hasn’t affected how the bureau is covering the leadership race, says Benzie, but it has generated intense reader interest. “Christine Elliott is a known commodity given that this is her third run at the leadership, and her late husband, Jim Flaherty, ran twice before. Caroline Mulroney is the eldest child of a very famous Canadian political figure, and Doug Ford is a well-known Toronto councillor and brother to the late ex-mayor of Toronto Rob Ford,” he said. “So you have three big names in a race and that is always interesting.” How does the bureau cope with balancing the demands of covering the PC party with the demands of covering the other two major political parties? Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Liberals and the New Democrats have been content lately to go to ground and let the turmoil in the PC party, currently led by interim leader Vic Fedeli, consume the headlines.  “It’s an old political axiom that when your opponents are pouring gasoline on themselves and lighting a match, you stand back,” said Benzie. “I think Mr. Fedeli has done a good job in terms of making changes from the Brown era, but if you’re the Liberals or the New Democrats, you just want to say stand back, and let the Tories do their thing. Then, after the dust settles, come in and shoot the wounded.” The Star’s trust committee periodically hears from readers who perceive the newspaper’s political coverage as biased in favour of the Liberals. Since 1987, the Star’s editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, has endorsed the Liberals in every provincial election, except in 1999 when the newspaper endorsed Howard Hampton’s NDP. But any suggestion that this affects how the newspaper’s Queen’s Park reporters do their jobs is nonsense, says Benzie. “I used to work for the Toronto Sun and the National Post and I’m the same reporter that I was then. I didn’t care about the editorials at those outlets and I don’t care about the editorials at the Star,” he said.  Ferguson agreed: “I used to cover Queen’s Park for The Canadian Press during the last months of Bob Rae and the beginning of Mike Harris’s government. No one called me a Liberal hack back then.” Ferguson points out that he spent all of September, October and November of last year covering two political corruption trials involving the Liberals — the byelection bribery trial in Sudbury and the gas plants trial in Toronto. He added the Star was one of the few media organizations to attend the gas plants trial every day. Rushowy, who joined Queen’s Park a year-and-a-half ago, stressed that bureau reporters do their best to get voices from all three major parties in stories, as the parties all have elected representatives at Queen’s Park.  “We try to give readers as many viewpoints as possible,” she said. At the end of the day, says Benzie, it would be detrimental to the Star’s ability to cover politics if any reporters were seen to be leaning toward any party.  “You don’t want anyone thinking you’re a Liberal or Tory or NDP hack, because then the other two parties won’t talk to you,” he said, adding he does not vote in any elections. “We take this place seriously and because we do, we are taken seriously.” ",0,How the Star's Queen's Park bureau juggles coverage of all three major parties
"Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”? Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv? Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang? Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female? These are just a few questions tackled recently by the Star’s style committee, whose role is to ensure consistency in editorial style across all Star platforms. (See how the committee dealt with these questions in the fact box at the end of this article). Words are powerful, and that’s why members of the style committee, made up of editors and reporters, take their job seriously.  This involves being a resource for the newsroom, keeping the Star’s stylebook up to date with contemporary terms and conventions of usage, and weighing in on style-related questions and concerns raised by readers, often relayed by the public editor. What does the word “style” mean in the context of the Star’s various platforms?  Anthony Collins, the Star’s style chief and co-chair of the style committee, describes style as a set of rules about the language the Star uses, encompassing everything from spelling and capitalization to how we treat numbers and measurements, and the word choices we make when we report on sensitive issues. “Style is important because it makes our writing clearer, more accurate and more consistent, all of which promote trust in our journalism. It also ensures we’re up to date with language change, while being respectful of the communities we serve, and helps give the Star its distinctive voice,” said Collins in an interview.  Star style is informed by a broad range of sources, including The Canadian Press, which publishes both a stylebook and a capitalization and spelling guide that are used by various media outlets. Other considerations come from the developing use of terms or phrases by the public and feedback from readers.  Sometimes a style is adopted to make stories easier for readers to find. For example, the Star’s style guide uses the spelling Al Qaeda rather than al-Qaida because the first spelling is more common and makes our stories easier to find online.  Style decisions are also made by the newsroom’s top editors, such as in the move to use Daesh instead of ISIS, mainly because the Islamic State is considered neither Islamic nor a state.  Because of the Star’s broad readership, the newsroom is constantly trying to strike a balance between using language that is easily understood by most of our readers, and using terms that are considered up to date and respectful by specific communities, Collins said. For example, last year, public editor Kathy English announced the Star had decided to capitalize “Indigenous” in all cases, and “Black” in reference to Black people, identity, culture and community. This came about after the style committee had received many passionate and thoughtful arguments in favour of making these changes as a mark of respect. The committee consulted widely with individuals and community groups and then rewrote two sections of the Star’s stylebook.  “I believe decisions as small as changes in newspaper style can have a major effect on marginalized communities and the way they’re seen,” Collins said. “Look at the way the conversation has changed around mental illness, for example. Not using ‘schizophrenic’ as a careless metaphor, or choosing to say ‘die by suicide’ instead of ‘commit suicide,’ can help lessen the stigma. Social justice is one of the Star’s guiding principles and I think our language use should reflect our philosophy.” A hard-and-fast rule isn’t always the answer in many cases. For instance, Star style dictates that gender-neutral terms are preferred for occupations, such as firefighter and flight attendant, but the term “actress” is still used when it comes to award show nominations.  Then there’s the sheer practicality that comes with a clear and consistent style, says the Star’s style committee co-chair Jon Ohayon. If editors and reporters are confused about what terms and spellings to use, when to convert measurements to metric, or what currency to use, time can be wasted. A lack of consistency can also make it hard to find previous stories or photos in the Star’s archive or online — and also lead to an impression of carelessness. “For example, it would look sloppy or ridiculous to have a headline that says ISIS on one story and one that says Daesh on another, or to have two different spellings of a city, country or person on the same page,” said Ohayon.  “Without style, we would be a mess and that leads to a loss of trust.”  In the Star, it’s The 6. We found that was the most common and clearest way to write it. We follow The Canadian Press style (which adopts the Ukrainian rather than the Russian spelling). It’s Kyiv. We follow The Canadian Press and The Associated Press and spell it Pyeongchang. Definitely not Pyongyang. It has an ombudsman, currently Susan Opler. Many offices use ombudsman as a gender-neutral term, derived from Swedish. The Star follows the preference of the office in question.  ",0,The Star’s style committee on the importance of language
"One of the primary goals of the Toronto Star’s trust project, launched last May, is to be more transparent about how we do our journalism.  Hence the decision to hold an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit, an online news aggregation and rating website where users can post content and discuss a wide array of topics.  Over a two-hour period last Tuesday, a group of Star reporters and editors responded to more than 60 questions from readers.  What follows is a sampling of the questions and answers from the AMA. Some have been shortened for space, but you can read the full text on  .  The thing about this question is that if I thought a story was the top one in the city, I’d be talking about it — and I assume the same goes for most editors and reporters. So finding the pressing issue everyone’s ignoring is hard, since we wouldn’t ignore it if we knew about it and thought it was very important. That said, I think that the dire lack of affordable housing in the city, and the desperate inability of Toronto Community Housing to fill the gap for the poorest in the city, remains an under-discussed story. It does get talked about, but it’s a crisis.   It’s actually so much fun. Obviously exhausting and often ridiculous, but what more can you ask for as a journalist? The stories are both important and entertaining, you’re able to hold powerful people accountable, readership is super high, and you’re not putting yourself at physical risk the way journalists are in a war zone or disaster zone ... So there are moments when I just want to nap, but I mostly love it.  Once we verify an error we correct on the platform the mistake was published on as promptly as is possible. The goal of a correction is to provide the correct information and make clear a mistake occurred. We logged about 1,100 corrections in print and online in 2017. Most of the mistakes are from online platforms.    Our Queen’s Park bureau chief, Robert Benzie, was at home with his kids when he got a call about Brown’s 9:45 p.m. press conference, and raced over to the Legislature. He was up well into the night filing updates. Reporters don’t get a lot of wake-up calls, but when there is big news on our beats, we work — late nights, early mornings, holidays, you name it.    This is tough. Look at the Ford example. In 2010, Ford was a councillor known for politically incorrect statements on the council floor who few believed could ever be mayor. Our bureau chief, David Rider, was one of the first mainstream media reporters to start paying attention to his campaign and realize he had a base of support that could make him a contender. To me, that’s something our readers should know about … Turns out, he knew before many that Ford could win and he was right.     In the past few years, we’ve actually been joining forces with more news media outlets across the world for big investigations like the Panama Papers. Reporter Robert Cribb and editor Lynn McAuley created our investigative co-production team as a way to share resources on big stories. This is the future, we think: news organizations working together more on large projects.   I totally get the disillusionment but don’t let it overcome you! There are multiple opportunities in the industry right now for a young journalist, ranging from freelancing to stints at places like the Star. There are risks in everything but keep hustling. Pitch stories everywhere, apply to places like the Star who accept a wide range of interns of all levels of experience every year. Things are definitely changing with people looking towards more digital stuff. The main takeaway is just learn as many skills as you can now as a young journalist ... It’s hard, and at times disheartening, but not impossible. Take it from a girl who applied three times before she got the Star internship.    Wow, what a great question. I think we cover stories all the time that may go against my personal beliefs. It’s strange because sometimes covering a story or watching a story develop I might change my belief!  —   In terms of news organizations like the Star, print is just one of the platforms we publish on. Its legacy is really the journalistic values it has ingrained in us — things like responsible reporting, checks and balances, such as our public editor, Kathy English, our membership in the national news-media council, and our daily talk about journalistic ethics as it pertains to news we cover … Now we take those same principles and apply them to the different platforms. We look to make a difference, to produce solid investigative and accountability journalism on many platforms … That is the how I see the Star in 10 years — the platform matters less than the work that is produced.

"Everyone has an opinion.  Scott Colby, the Star’s Opinions Editor, confronts this truism every day.  Colby will receive, on an average day, between 10 and 15 opinion pieces from members of the public covering a whole host of topics. Those hoping to get published run the gamut of the professional world, from politicians, academics, and economists, to lawyers, businesspeople, and health-care professionals. He also hears regularly from non-profit groups, agencies and students. His job is to sort through the submissions, choosing pieces that provide readers with thoughtful commentary on public interest issues. And that’s in addition to handling opinion pieces from the Star’s regular staff and nonstaff columnists that appear on the page opposite the Editorials page. This week we sat down with Colby, who’s been the Opinions Editor since May 2016 and an editor at the Star for 20 years, to find out how he presents a wide range of opinions on issues of the day. An op-ed is an old-fashioned name for an opinion piece, or column. Op-ed is an abbreviation of the phrase “opposite the editorial page.” Historically, newspapers publish an editorial page that is home to editorials, an editorial cartoon and letters. The opposite page of the same spread contains columns and other opinion pieces. An op-ed is no different from an opinion piece from a Star columnist in the sense that they are both articles of opinion on a timely topic. Columnists have the prestige of being a regular contributor whose writing and arguments are considered to be of a consistently high standard and they’ve earned the right to express their opinions in that paper up to three to four times a week. They also get a logo. I tell people I am looking for three things in a good op-ed: the topic must be timely, it must be well written, and it must be well argued. There is a distinction to be made between well written and well argued. You can have a nicely written article that essentially doesn’t saying anything or make a point. Where I think many writers miss the mark is they don’t understand that an op-ed needs to have a thesis; it needs to be an argument about an issue. We are not looking for a press release in disguise. When I solicit op-eds it’s because I’m looking for a commentary piece, or pieces, on a specific topic, such as NAFTA or Indigenous issues. In such cases, I am looking for an excellent writer and a person with expertise, or even a newsmaker directly involved in the issue. Soliciting op-eds can take quite a bit of time, which is a rare commodity these days. When I started this job, for example, I felt we needed to hear directly from Indigenous writers and leaders, as opposed to well-meaning supporters, so I reached out. We’ve published op-eds from Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, Grassy Narrows Chief Simon Fobister, and Indigenous academics at Trent University. We also want our Opinion page to reflect the changing demographic of the city and country, so having diverse voices is important. Like all mainstream media, we can do a better job, but we believe it is vital to publish diverse voices and we continually aspire to provide them for our readers. We strongly believe the Opinion page needs to be an open-minded venue. It is an excellent forum for debating the important issues of the day. To be clear, we will never intentionally publish anything that is hateful, insulting or bigoted. But I frequently select commentary that I don’t necessarily agree with, or that puts forward an opinion that contradicts our own editorials. If the author makes a compelling case on a timely issue, it benefits everyone when we publish those views to contribute to the debate. It’s important to listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to understand where each side is coming from. When we can really listen and understand, hopefully we’ll learn something about their motivations, for instance, that might make us more sympathetic, or it might expose something less innocent that deserves scrutiny.  We are not interested in being an echo chamber where readers only listen to the people they agree with. I love it when we can publish a page that contains opposing views on the same topic, as long as both pieces are well written and well argued. For example, earlier this month we published two op-eds taking different stands on the minimum wage increase, one by Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the other by Premier Kathleen Wynne. We receive a lot of op-eds from politicians and we reject most of them on the basis that they are essentially glorified press releases. When it comes to op-eds, we hold politicians to a higher standard than the public. Their op-eds must be saying something new and adding to the understanding of an important issue. We are vigilant in preventing the Star’s opinion pages from becoming an extension of a politician’s PR department. ",0,How the Star’s Opinions Editor chooses commentary from the public
"In an era when scientific research is coming under ever-increasing scrutiny — and attack — by some politicians and interest groups, the obligation for reporters on the science beat to “get it right” is paramount. Kate Allen, the Star’s Science & Technology reporter for the past five years, is keenly aware that stories she covers, particularly if they involve scientific studies, will likely be subjected to critical examination. That they must stand up to such scrutiny is crucial to reader trust. Science & Technology is a challenging beat, but one for which Allen has developed a number of checks and balances to ensure her readers are getting accurate, fair, but also interesting science news. When it comes to reporting on studies, for which story pitches inundate her inbox, she says, journalists have to be careful. One of the first things she’ll do if a study looks interesting is send it to researchers who are experts in the field, but who weren’t involved in that particular study. “I’ve killed lots of stories after researchers told me the study I wanted to write about was flawed or overhyped,” Allen said in an interview, noting she has also learned to be skeptical whenever she sees any claims that a study has found a “cure” or made a “breakthrough.” “The truth is that good science is incremental and often really slow. Big, flashy breakthroughs are rare. More often, one piece of research builds on another until we have a slightly less hazy picture of what’s going on,” she explained. “Though I don’t cover medical science, it’s especially dangerous to throw around the words ‘cure’ or ‘breakthrough’ and give people false hope about eliminating diseases.” Allen says she is trying to spend less time reporting on studies, given that high-profile research usually get lots of media coverage. “I don’t think it’s a good use of my time to write the 101st story about the latest study in Science or Nature, unless it’s truly a breakthrough or is just too irresistible to miss,” Allen explained. “I’m trying to spend more time hunting for stories that wouldn’t get reported on at all otherwise.” So, how does Allen choose the topics she writes about?  She looks for stories that are just plain fascinating, she says, and relevant to readers’ lives. For example, in 2015, Allen profiled  , a University of Toronto professor widely considered the godfather of a type of artificial intelligence known as “deep learning” that has transformed how computer applications such as language translation and image recognition work. Think machines that understand verbal commands or self-driving cars. Then there are stories about changes happening in the natural world. Last month, Allen took a deep dive into how climate change has shifted where  . The result is a massive global shakeup with costly consequences for our own species.  But when it comes to reporting on scientific research, which is often funded by governments, reporters can come up against political pushback.  It can be a hostile world. Just last month, the Washington Post reported the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was warned by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump not to use seven words, including “science-based,” “evidence-based” and “transgender,” in 2018 budget documents.  Even in Canada, the Conservative government under former prime minister Stephen Harper faced heavy criticism when it was accused of gagging scientists in federal agencies and institutions by implementing strict guidelines surrounding what they could say publicly about their research.  All the more reason for people to be presented with facts to help them form their opinions and live their lives, says Allen. Most scientific research is by definition of interest to the public, she said. “For one, Canadians pay for it with their taxes. For another, scientific developments either help explain, or actually cause, the ways that the world is changing.  “But often my test for whether to cover a story or not is just how excited I get to learn about the research myself.” ",0,Kate Allen talks checks and balances on the Science & Technology beat
"It promised to be the biggest scoop of Roy Howard’s life. The Great War was over. He had chased the rumour all day in the French city of Brest, but now he finally had it on the record from a high-ranking naval official. It was Nov. 7, 1918. The war was not over, but Howard had reason to believe that it was. As the president of the United Press wire service, he sent the good news back to New York, sending the continent into a frenzy of false joy, sealing his name in the history books forever: Roy Howard, the man who broke the false armistice — or as he liked to call it — the premature armistice. It was a fluke that it made it through the censors, but it seemed legitimate when it landed in New York just before noon. Reporters at rival agencies tried to match it in vain. Had they missed the story of the century? There was no official confirmation from the U.S. government, but once the first tentative reports hit the streets at lunchtime, people didn’t return to work. The party had begun. Toronto newsrooms received the United Press bulletin aroundthe same time. Word began to spread by telephone, telegram and word of mouth. People poured out of offices and factories and gathered in front of the Star, as they often did when news was breaking. There was no official confirmation, but “never before,” the Star wrote, “has the city been so deeply stirred.” Allen Cuthbertson grabbed his camera. The 30-year-old had taken over his family carpet company at the beginning of the war and knew downtown well. He climbed to the top floors of the city’s tallest buildings at King and Yonge. From his perch, he saw the ticker tape catch on the hydro and streetcar lines. There were horns, whistles, pots, pans, laughter, shouting, singing, every noise, all at once. People were blocking traffic and dancing on the sidewalks. “For the first time in its history,” the Star noted in its evening edition, “Toronto today might be symbolized by a Cheshire cat that has the greatest grin in the world, the smile that won’t come off.” The next morning, Toronto and much of North America woke up to a terrible hangover. Soldiers were still advancing. Through a series of coincidence and confusion, the false armistice had grown from rumour into a “fact.”  In their evening edition, the Star acknowledged the mistaken report, but they called it “the wildest orgy of pleasure ever witnessed in Canada, and unequalled in the history of the Queen City.” The Associated Press, the great rival to the United Press, called it the “greatest hoax of recent years.” James Smith, a retired history teacher from England, had taught this time period for decades, but never learned about the false armistice until he picked up a book at a second-hand shop six years ago. He was fascinated and began to dig through archives and old newspapers to parse the conflicting information, mystery and intrigue. “I became quite angry that nothing had been picked up about it in British history books,” he said. So he created his own  . Details of what happened that day vary depending on the narrator. The following is drawn from telegrams, letters and accounts from Roy Howard’s personal  , held at the Media School of Indiana University. By the end of the First World War, the United Press was still considered an upstart in the newswire game. Created in 1907 by American newsman E.W. Scripps, the ambitious and talented journalist Roy Howard had been president of the service since 1912, and he and his reporters worked hard to expand their coverage of the world and to be a bona fide competitor of The Associated Press (founded in 1846). Howard had just finished a business trip to South America when he arrived in Paris in fall 1918. Although he was an executive with connections, he was also an accredited war correspondent. It was no secret that the war would be over soon. The Germans had been talking about an armistice since October, but the Allies wanted unconditional surrender, and kept pushing eastward. Howard, 35, was planning to sail home from Brest, a major telegraph hub and military port on France’s west coast. When he arrived on the morning of Nov. 7, the official who picked him up at the train station asked if he’d heard the “grand news.” The war was over.  Howard knew that if he could confirm the rumour, he’d have a head start over any reporter filing from Paris, given the “slowness and inefficiency” of the French telegraph lines, and the fact that Brest was right on the coast with a direct line to New York. The reputation of a newswire was made on quick, accurate coverage of history-defining moments like assassinations and elections. (To this day, The Associated Press notes: “Over the past 170 years, we have been first to inform the world of many of history’s most important moments, from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the bombing of Pearl Harbor to the fall of the Shah of Iran and the death of Pope John Paul.”) United Press reporters had worked hard to prove themselves during the war, and Howard had that same drive.  “I doubt whether anyone other than Roy Howard could have got that story out of Brest,” Smith says. “Most people who write about it say he was the right man in the right place, at the wrong time.” As he walked around the U.S. naval base with a military escort, official confirmation proved elusive, but drinks and toasts “To the Armistice!” were not. Howard was worried that his advantage over Paris was slipping away. Luckily, or unluckily, as it turned out, his breakthrough came that afternoon. Admiral Henry B. Wilson, the commanding officer of the United States naval forces, had received a telegram from Paris. The war was over. Howard asked if it was official.  “Absolutely, right from headquarters — right from Paris — I just got it a few minutes ago,” Wilson told him. Wilson was planning to send the news to a nearby French newspaper, and he had no problem allowing Wilson to share the news with readers back home in the U.S. He even sent his French-speaking confidential secretary with Howard to “expedite the dispatch” at the cable office. Howard stopped at the office of the French paper nearby so the message could be typed. It was mistakenly given a Paris dateline, and then it was sent at 4:20 p.m. Brest time. Would he go down in history as the man who broke the story? All around him people were already going “bugs” at the news. Even the thrifty French merchants were giving out bottles of wine. Howard had no idea his story had quickly cleared censors, and similar celebrations were kicking off across North America. Over the years, Howard told the next part of the story — the moment the nightmare dawned — a bit differently. In a 1918 letter to a colleague, he said he found out after dinner when he was at the French newspaper office. In his 1936 account, it was more dramatic: he was dining at Brest’s liveliest restaurant with intelligence officers, and before he could even order a cocktail, a messenger came in with the horrifying update from Adm. Wilson. A later investigation by U.S. military intelligence would determine the false armistice had become “official” through a game of broken telephone between American and French military circles in Paris. Capt. H.J. Whitehouse, the acting director of the Liaison Service, which acted as a go-between for different branches of the American forces, as well as other Allied forces, had “reliable and authentic” information that the armistice had been signed. One of his men, Capt. Stanton, had received the information from a French officer. American intelligence officers were doubtful — they hadn’t heard anything from their senior contacts, and they tried to quash the rumour all day. They informed headquarters that it should be treated with “greatest reserve.” But an attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Paris had already sent a telegram to Washington, and it was talked about as a fact at “the American Club luncheon” in Paris. In this climate, a naval intelligence officer wired the news as “authentic” to Adm. Wilson in Brest, who told Roy Howard.  (The same investigation figured the root cause of the rumour was a temporary, very localized ceasefire planned on Nov. 7 for a peace delegation — telegrams had been intercepted and misconstrued.) “It’s fascinating because it gives a real insight into the absolute chaos and confusion in communication from the front and between newspapers at the time,” Smith says. A stunned Howard hoped the censors had killed his story. He filed another bulletin, hoping to correct his mistake, but in a cruel twist,   version was held up by naval censors. His original report, he would later learn, had been helped along by the presence of Wilson’s confidential secretary, and an erroneous Paris dateline that suggested it had already been cleared by the American censor there. Also, Howard noted, the censor’s room in Brest was deserted when he and Wilson’s aide were there. Everybody was partying. In Paris, the censors had been able to rein in their local papers from publishing reports, Smith says. In England, the false armistice news had actually made it there 20 minutes earlier than the U.S., via the American Embassy in London, he says. Reuters must have had a contact there, because it was issuing special bulletins. Very quickly, the British Foreign Office issued a “cautionary note” to tell the agency it wasn’t true. “Reuters within 20 minutes issued a disclaimer saying ‘Cancel that,’ but it was too late,” Smith says. It was evening in England, and people were lighting fireworks and ringing the church bells, both violations of wartime restrictions.  Back in North America, doubt had crept into newsrooms, but not the streets. AP had no confirmation from its war bureaus. In Washington, the  State Department issued a denial, to little effect. “News services and correspondents that questioned the authenticity of this bulletin were ridiculed,” Howard later wrote. The world wanted a good time and a “twenty word news bulletin furnished the detonating spark,” he wrote. The Star had a tight afternoon deadline. “Up to the hour of going to press no official confirmation had been received,” it wrote on the front page, which had stories of people dancing in the streets. The paper was published for 5 p.m.: “Unofficially reported armistice is signed,” the front page read.  The Telegram, also an evening paper, took a different approach. “Germany has not yet signed a surrender.” The Globe, with a later deadline for a morning publication, was measured. It included stories about the quiet celebrations in homes over the “peace news,” and how the jubilation in Hamilton was not dampened by the denials. In one story — aptly headlined, “Tell me, is the news official?” — a reporter visited soldiers in a military hospital. “It’s the old mothers I’m thinking of,” one soldier said. “I’ve always thought that peace, if it did come, would be a big strain, and now if they’re disappointed,” he trailed off. “You learn a lot about women’s patience lying here, Sister.” The most fascinating element, Richard Schwarzlose wrote in  was that readers were “willing to trust their emotions to a few lines of newsbroker bulletin — and do it all over again four days later when the real armistice was signed.” Roy Howard was having a very bad week back in France. The general manager  in New York sent him a telegram that reached him Nov. 9. The United Press had held firm to the story as long as it could. But in the message, every line was worse that the last, all capital letters and no punctuation. The best thing to do was get an explanation out. Howard scrambled to figure out what went wrong.  “I’m still a bit groggy from this jolt,” he wrote to his Paris bureau chief. “I am fully conscious of what it has done to us in America.” Adm. Wilson, who had sworn the news was official, felt pretty bad. He said that Howard had acted in good faith. “Of course he has no idea of what the thing means to us, but he could see that it was a bad mess and he came all the way through to do everything within his power to undo the damage,” Howard wrote. Howard replayed the scenario in letters to colleagues and friends: “There would be nothing for me or any other newspaper man to do except just what I did.” The public seemed to understand. In their minds the war was over, and they accepted the mistake in “good spirit,” he wrote. But other journalists, led by The Associated Press, were calling the United Press a “nefarious” outfit who should be made to pay for the clean-up, and Howard a traitor to his profession and country.  “Indignation burned like a brush fire in the columns of those virtuous paragons of American journalism which had not printed the report,” Howard wrote. In Toronto, the Tely was feeling quite virtuous. When the real armistice was signed, it was the first to report it. “First as usual, with the truth,” it said, including a drawing of Star publisher Joseph Atkinson riding a star through the sky, his hair askew, and in his hand a “fake armistice bulletin.” When the official records of the State Department were declassified in the early 1930s, Howard was cleared of blame. In a telegram sent on Nov. 8, 1918, Edward House, the U.S. diplomat at the centre of peace talks, said that if there was any fault in the matter, it rested with an American official in Paris and the “French official” who passed along the rumour. In 1936, writing in a colleague’s book, Howard wondered whether that “French” official might actually be German. “The Germans wanted an armistice desperately — and wanted it quickly,” he wrote. “They were faced with starvation, anarchy and civil war. Time meant everything.” The Germans knew the Allied military leaders would keep pushing so they could be “ruthless” with their terms, but families everywhere wanted peace, and “if these nationals could just be told that an armistice had been signed … it was reasonable to suppose that their joy would be so great that no power would risk continuance of the war.” Smith, the retired history teacher, says that the German spy theory was first outlined by American intelligence officer Arthur Hornblow, who would later become a Hollywood producer dabbling in screwball comedies, film noir and musicals like  . Hornblow was in Brest that day, and spent some time with Howard. Smith thinks the spy theory was a cover-up for the “huge blunder,” but it can’t be proven either way. “If there were originally any German documents about the spy activities, a lot of the German activities during the First World War were destroyed during the Second World War in bombing,” he says. Smith subscribes to the theory outlined in the U.S. military documents — that a telegram for a temporary ceasefire was misunderstood. He is amazed by the way the false armistice persisted as a “folk memory” in North America. President Truman noted it in a 1951 speech and mentioned Roy Howard by name. F. Scott Fitzgerald dropped it into a book. “Everybody experienced it. Thousands and thousands of them, even to the extent of saying, ‘Oh, he was born on the false Armistice Day,’ ” Smith says. But in England, the story quickly disappeared. Howard, who was a major shareholder in United Press, had worried the mistake would cost at least “a quarter of a million” worth of damage, but there was no lasting financial impact. Smith says some editors and newspapers wouldn’t “fully trust” the United Press bulletins until they saw The Associated Press reporting on the same, but Howard went on to have a long career. He became chairman of the board of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, but he continued to report, travel the world, and interview world leaders. He never lived down the false armistice, but he seemed to have a sense of humour about it. Once, while giving a speech at a dinner, someone heckled him. Smith says that Howard was quick and good-natured with his reply: “Hey, you listen to me. I stopped a war at one stage, you know.” ",0,"Days before the end of the First World War, Canadians celebrated in the streets. But it was thanks to fake news"
"There is an aphorism often quoted by lawyers and the journalists who cover legal proceedings: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.” That saying, which originated more than 90 years ago from Gordon Hewart, lord chief justice of England, is constantly in the back of Jacques Gallant’s mind while he navigates the complex world of Ontario’s courts and tribunals. As the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, Gallant takes readers inside the justice system, highlighting precedent-setting cases and rulings that impact the public, and pointing out problems, such as delays in cases coming to trial.  To find stories, Gallant talks to lawyers and members of the public about cases they are involved in, checks with the various colleges that regulate health-related professions, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, to find out which of their members are facing disciplinary hearings, and mines CanLii, a free online database containing most Canadian court decisions. But keeping readers enlightened about the goings-on of our legal system relies on the assumption that the courts and tribunals are by default open to the public, as they should be. In practice, however, Gallant has found this is not always the case.  “The courts are supposed to be presumptively public, which means that anyone should be able to walk into a courthouse and request to view the file from a court case,” said Gallant.  But on numerous occasions, Gallant has encountered courts and tribunals that seem to have secrecy as their default setting — meaning Star readers, and by extension the public, aren’t able to get a full picture of what is going on in these public institutions.  “In my own experience, I’ve dealt with courthouse staff across the GTA who give me strange looks when they find out I’m not a lawyer, but rather a journalist,” Gallant said. “I’ve had to wait weeks to get access to even the most basic of court documents, known as ‘the information,’ which lists the charges an accused person is facing as well as their next court date.” Indeed, early last year, the Star   against the provincial government to end the secrecy surrounding the province’s tribunal system, which handles accusations around human rights abuses, police misconduct, and environmental offences. The Star’s case is ongoing.  Gallant said accessing court exhibits, even in cases that are no longer active and for which higher courts have ruled that exhibits should be public, is also often difficult. “Documents such as these are crucial in order to accurately and fairly report on a legal matter,” he said. Case in point: when reporting on the ongoing case of Dr. Javad Peirovy, a Toronto doctor found by the College of Physicians’ discipline committee to have sexually abused four female patients, and who is fighting in court to keep his medical licence, Gallant had trouble accessing documents related to the case. In 2016, the discipline committee ruled to suspend Peirovy for six months, rather than revoke his licence. The college disagreed with this ruling, and appealed the decision by its own committee to the Divisional Court.  At the time, in order to provide readers with a  , Gallant sought to obtain Peirovy’s arguments at Divisional Court for why Peirovy should retain his licence. As it turned out, this was not an easy task.  When Gallant asked the Divisional Court for Peirovy’s official response to the appeal, a court official told him the file was with the judges and could not be accessed.  So Gallant reached out to Peirovy’s lawyer, who would not provide the official response either.  Gallant then had to reach out to the Ministry of the Attorney General to make his case that the file should be made available to him. The ministry, in turn, contacted the court, and a few days later Gallant was told he could now view the file at the Divisional Court. “If not for (the ministry’s intervention), I would not have been able to report a complete picture of the Peirovy case,” Gallant said.  The college ended up winning its appeal, but Peirovy then appealed to the Court of Appeal. A decision has yet to be released. These types of situations — where public documents are not readily accessible to the public — discredit the legal system, Gallant said. “For the Canadian justice system to retain its credibility, it needs to be open and transparent,” he said. “The public needs to be assured that the justice system is working, and reporters act as their representatives in court.” ",0,How the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter navigates Ontario’s complex justice system
"Betty Disero, a former Toronto city councillor who in 1991 briefly ran for mayor, has landed the top job in a completely different community. Disero was recently elected “lord mayor” of Niagara-on-the-Lake, as the scenic tourist town calls its top municipal politician. She became the first woman to hold that post, after four years as a town councillor who made her mark warning residents about the hazards of uncontrolled development. The town of more than 17,000, famous for wineries and the Shaw theatre festival, will also have a   since Clare Cameron garnered the most votes for council. In some ways, Disero said in an interview, the issues she’ll face in her four-year term mirror those of the much bigger boom town she left in 2009. “This town is growing so much more quickly than before, so we’re starting to have, believe it or not, issues with traffic congestion, overdevelopment, losing some of the character of what used to be here,” Disero said, adding that in other ways Niagara-on-the-Lake is very different from Toronto. “Toronto is not a farming community. We are a farming community here,” she said. “I’m learning about irrigation, the need for protecting bees, certain types of herbicides and pesticides — trying to balance all of that and the need for safe passage for pedestrians while allowing farmers to farm properly.” Disero entered politics in the early 1980s as a Toronto separate school trustee, jumping in 1985 to council in the Davenport ward by defeating 25-year incumbent Joe Piccininni. She was a major force at city hall for almost 18 years, the last six on the council of the new amalgamated city, with posts including chair of the Toronto Harbour Commission and later the TTC.  Then mayor Mel Lastman appointed Disero, a Liberal able to work across political lines, to a task force with a goal of diverting waste from landfill after Lastman’s plan to send waste to a decommissioned northern mine fell apart. In March 2003, Disero stunned colleagues by announcing her retirement from politics, later setting up a lobbying firm, Boomer Consulting, named after her family dog. Disero said it was a family tragedy — the 2009 death of her adult son Michael — that prompted her move out of Toronto. “I needed to run away. I needed to start over,” she said. “I came to visit a friend in Niagara-on-the-Lake and it just felt like home the weekend I was here. The following weekend I came and bought a property and then built a house.” She worked on her garden and learned about her new home until a Canada Day barbecue in 2014, when friends noted the rapidly growing town’s official plan hadn’t been reviewed in decades. They recalled her political past and urged her to make what was a successful run for council. Disero says she tried to build alliances but found herself on the losing end of 8-1 votes, at odds with council colleagues who didn’t share her view about  amid fears that agricultural land, even in the protected Greenbelt, could become GTA-style subdivisions. “There were a lot of people saying we needed to put in a tree bylaw, so developers couldn’t just come in and clear-cut. Some around the council table kept calling it the ‘Toronto intrusion,’ the idea that some trees and heritage sites deserve protection, but I didn’t get that from the public,” she said. “I understood it. It was political — a little bit offensive, but my colleagues on council were not used to pushing.” She decided to run for lord mayor and beat incumbent Patrick Darte with 4,169 votes to his 2,743. Disero says in her four-year term, she will push to finally modernize the official town plan and create “an administration that can cope with the development in the area.  “I guess they’re not used to noise control and other issues large urban areas have been dealing with for years. All of those must be brought into the mix here,” while protecting homeowners’ property rights, she said, adding she marvels at Toronto’s growth while visiting her former home. “I get a bit of a ‘Wow!’ feeling when I visit Toronto, but Niagara-on-the-Lake is my home now and I love every day here.” Tom Elltoft, a local real estate agent who grew up in Niagara-on-the-Lake, says he is happy to have the Toronto transplant leading his hometown into the future. “I think it’s great to have somebody who can offer the experience she has in her background,” he said. “We suddenly got on the radar of Toronto developers as they push out and I think we were feeling a little ill equipped at all levels to deal with it. “You don’t want to close the doors on development — everyone has to grow — but it was feeling a little Wild West.” ",0,Longtime Toronto councillor lands top job in Niagara-on-the-Lake
"Canadian rapper Drake has accused a casino in Vancouver of racially profiling him. Early Saturday morning,  the chart-topping musician took to Instagram to vent after a night out at the Parq Vancouver. Emoticons of exasperation ensued. “Parq casino @parqvancouverbc is the worst run business I have ever witnessed … profiling me and not allowing me to gamble when I had everything they originally asked me for,” the post read. Drake landed in Vancouver on Friday, a stop in his Aubrey and the Three Migos Tour. He was scheduled to perform two concerts over the weekend. Parq casino is currently investigating the incident, and   Saturday. “Parq Vancouver is sorry to hear about this experience and takes these matters very seriously. We are required to adhere to strict regulations with respect to gaming in British Columbia,” it said, adding it had made efforts to reach “the customer and his team to discuss the issue.” The casino operates in one of the most complex, highly regulated industries in Canada. An RCMP report found evidence of money laundering in B.C. casinos linked to organized crime, drug importing, distribution and trafficking.

"PITTSBURGH – The Maple Leafs can win without Auston Matthews after all. Matthews fell to a shoulder injury a week ago. Time to step up, they all said to each other and anyone who would listen. But in losing to Calgary and Dallas this week, the Leafs seemed a bit lost without their best player. It took them a couple of games then to “step up” without Matthews, but they finally did. The Leafs dominated the Pittsburgh Penguins, getting big goals and big plays from their bigger names and even some scoring from secondary sources, en route to a 5-0 win Saturday night. -Morgan Rielly got scored twice, including once on the power play after an admittedly lucky bounce. -Zach Hyman got the luckiest bounce, off a Penguins defender, for a short-handed goal. -John Tavares and Patrick Marleau also scored.  Frederik Andersen stopped all 31 shots for his first shutout of the season. It was the sixth game in a row that Andersen has allowed two or fewer goals against. It was his 10  shutout as a Leaf, and he became the first Leaf goalie to get a shutout in Pittsburgh since Mikael Tellqvist did on March 19, 2006. “Tough building,” said Andersen. “A really good team. Extra bonus. We’re happy with the win. Get back on track here.” ? Maybe not actually. Leaf Nation showed up in force, bringing their “Go Leafs Go” chant. On a night when the Penguins fans had little to cheer, it sounded more like a Leaf home game. Except with a Leafs win. They’re 6-0-0 on the road, 3-5-0 at home.  Rielly now has six goals, and leads all NHL defencemen in that category. Mike Babcock: I thought Morgan was really good today defensively. Sometimes – he's always good offensively – but sometimes he's not quite as good defensively. Today he was really good defensively and really committed. There's no one who likes being a Leaf more on our team than Morgan and he provides leadership that way. He's got unbelievable enthusiasm every day and a zest for life and he shares that with the guys. You need energy people and he's one of those.”  The Leafs power play went 1-for-3, and has scored in three straight games after a bit of a lull. Rielly was the beneficiary of a lucky bounce for the power play goal, to the point where neither he nor Marner – whose pass towards Marleau deflected to Rielly – didn’t even want to talk about it. The penalty kill killed all five minors, with Marner at times going 1-on-5. The Leafs penalty kill had better scoring chances than the Penguins power play. Hyman scored shorthanded. Matt Murray made the save, but the puck bounced off a defender and into the net.  Hyman’s been snakebit all year. The goal was his first of the season. His coach was quite happy for him. “He should have had a couple (of goals already),” said Leafs coach Mike Babcock. “I don’t worry about him. The one thing about Zach, he’s not like a lot of people. His confidence doesn’t come and go. He just does the right thing everyday. He’s not really effected by the results. But it’s good for any player. No one likes to go long without scoring.” They went head to head most of the night. Tavares had a goal and an assist, and was plus-2. Sidney Crosby was a minus-3. Tavares on Crosby: “When you are going up against the best player of this generation and what he’s done over the course of his career, you know you have to compete at a high level. His competitiveness and skill set is well rounded. It’s fun to play against him. These are great games to be a part of. Crosby on Tavares: “He’s ready to compete when you play against him. He plays both ends of the ice. He likes to get offensive zone time, and handle the puck down low. You’ve got to be quick to get out of your own zone, because he can possess it for a while.” Toronto is 4-0-0 when scoring the first goal of the game. The Maple Leafs are 4-0-0 when leading after one period and 6-0-0 when leading after two periods. Toronto has a 5-2-0 record when outshooting their opponent. The Maple Leafs are 3-2-0 in Saturday games. Toronto’s line of Nazem Kadri, Kasperi Kapanen and Patrick Marleau started 36.4 per cent of their 5-on-5 shifts in the offensive zone, which was the lowest percentage among Maple Leafs skaters. Their Corsi (possession numbers) reflect that. Kapanen was at 40 per cent, Kadri 37.93 per cent and Marleau 39.29 per cent, according to corsica.hockey. Kapanen still found a way to get two assists, and was the team leader at plus-3. ? Email me at   and I’ll answer it in Friday’s Mailbag.

"Readers will often come across the word “lockup” in media coverage of provincial and federal budgets, but it’s a term that is rarely explained. In essence, a budget lockup is the government’s way of providing journalists with details in advance of the document becoming public when the Minister of Finance speaks to the House later that day, usually around 4 p.m. The idea is to give journalists time to review the budget, ask questions of bureaucrats, and write their stories before the embargo is lifted.  But here’s the catch. Because budgets contain information that could influence the financial markets, at least in theory, no details can be made public until after the markets close. That means no communication with people outside once the lockup begins. This week we sat down with Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie to find out what it’s like inside the lockup and how journalists deal with the challenges of reporting on the budget’s contents — which impact all Ontarians — without the benefit of contact with the outside world.  While we have a budget sked before we enter the lockup, it evolves during the day. The Star’s Queen’s Park Bureau as well as beat reporters, editorial writers, and columnists are also part of our contingent. We annually enlist the assistance of a Scotiabank economist who helps us in deciphering the sometimes impenetrable numbers in the massive document. The first thing I do every year is read the finance minister’s speech to the Legislature, where we glean the themes of the budget. I bring my noise-cancelling headphones and a playlist of jazz pianist Bill Evans and repair to a quiet corner to read it closely. I am looking both for information and compelling quotes for the main budget story. That’s the overview of our coverage and contains elements that will be explored more deeply in the various sidebars. If it’s interesting enough to be noteworthy to each other it’s probably going to be useful information for Star readers. Probably the most eventful budget of the approximately 30 federal and provincial lockups I have been at was in May 2014. There was a minority Liberal government at the time so Premier Kathleen Wynne needed support from either Tim Hudak’s Progressive Conservatives or Andrea Horwath’s New Democrats. While we knew the Conservatives would not back the Liberals’ fiscal plan, the NDP had propped up the minority Liberals in the 2012 and 2013 budgets. But in 2014, we learned — after getting into the lockup — that Horwath was skipping the traditional opposition leaders’ press conferences because the New Democrats were going to vote against the budget. That meant we were having an election. Luckily, our colleagues who had not yet entered the lockup knew this so that message could get to the Star newsroom. But we were marooned all day in an essentially meaningless lockup knowing we were being plunged into an election. We have the entire day to study the budget and have press conferences with the finance minister and the opposition leaders in the lockup. That is for the stories we publish when the embargo is lifted after the minister rises to address the Legislature. There are no phones allowed in the lockup so we are cut off from the outside world. We can query Ministry of Finance bureaucrats about aspects of the budget, but only on a not-for-attribution basis. All political questions are directed to politicians. They turn on the Wi-Fi at 4 p.m. so we can file our stories, but until then we are in an Internet-free Twilight Zone. There are around 150 journalists from nearly every major newspaper, wire service, TV network, radio station, and online outlet in the province. Each news organization has its own assigned table with its logo on it, equipped with electrical power bars and microphones for the press conferences. All of the budget documents and news releases are placed on your chair before you arrive at 8 a.m. It’s a very social place — it can be like old home week catching up with colleagues from different media outlets — but everyone is busy and has work to do so it’s seldom too distracting. Usually a hot meal is served — lasagna and roasted chicken are past favourites. There is lots of coffee and tea to keep us awake and large carafes of refreshing cucumber and lemon-infused water to keep us hydrated.

"PENSACOLA, FLA.—President Donald Trump on Saturday used his final Florida campaign event before next week’s elections to implore supporters to send Republicans to the governor’s mansion and the U.S. Senate, claiming that allowing Democrats to win either office would bring ruin to the state he also calls home. Trump returned to Florida for the second time this week to help rally support for Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Trump also sought to boost former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is facing off against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, in the race for governor. Trump argued that Gillum would “destroy Florida” and claimed that Gillum’s policies would be a “total nightmare” for the state. “You have only one choice: Ron DeSantis for governor,” Trump told thousands of cheering supporters at a rally at Pensacola International Airport, with Air Force One park right outside of the hangar. “If you want to pay high taxes, you ought to vote for the mayor of Tallahassee,” Trump said. “You will destroy the state that I love.” Trump noted that he also calls Florida home; his Mar-a-Lago estate is located in Palm Beach, and he spends most weekends there in the winter. Trump also criticized Nelson, claiming that he only sees the former astronaut “around election time when he’s on television every night.” Earlier Saturday, Trump campaigned in Montana, where he made it clear that he wants to see Democrat Jon Tester booted from the Senate on Tuesday over a personal grudge as much as political ambition. Trump blames Tester for the defeat of his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. The president told hundreds of cheering supporters at a separate airport rally in the Montana chill that Tester “tried to destroy” Ronny Jackson, a Navy admiral and White House doctor. “That’s why I’m here,” Trump said. “I’ve never forgotten, it and it’s honestly one of the reasons I’m here so much,” said Trump, who last campaigned in Montana in mid-October. “It’s a disgrace, what he did to that man.” Trump was in Montana to boost GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is challenging Tester in Tuesday’s election. The rallies are part of Trump’s multi-state blitz in the run-up to Tuesday’s balloting, when control of the House and Senate — and perhaps the future of Trump’s agenda — are at stake. Trump said having Rosendale in the Senate will be “phenomenal.” The president blames Tester for the backlash against Jackson, who eventually withdrew his nomination after facing anonymous ethics allegations, including claims of on-the-job drunkenness and wrecking a government vehicle. Jackson denied the allegations. Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veterans’ issues, had released a list of the allegations against Jackson that was compiled by the committee’s Democratic staff. Trump, however, doesn’t mention that the allegations weren’t the only factor that contributed to Jackson withdrawing from consideration. Lawmakers questioned Jackson’s limited managerial experience and his fitness to run a department as sprawling as the VA. At both rallies, Trump sought to rally the energized crowds by talking up the economy and tax cuts, new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, border security and several caravans of Central American migrants who are slowly advancing toward the U.S.-Mexico border. He mentioned plans for a new military branch called the Space Force and complained anew about the news media. Trump also defended his decision to focus almost exclusively on the migrants and immigration in the closing days of the election. He recently announced that he intends to change asylum procedures, end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship and build numerous “tent cities” to hold migrants caught crossing the border illegally. “You can only say so many times that we created 250,000 jobs last month,” Trump said in Montana, in defence of his focus on immigration that some of the president’s critics say amounts to fear-mongering. Trump has denied trying to instil fear as a reason to vote Republican on Election Day. “When we’re fixing a problem, or fixed a problem, there’s no reason to go on about it for 45 minutes,” Trump said. Trump also called up Rep. Greg Gianforte to speak from the podium but did not repeat his praise of the congressman, who was convicted of body slamming a journalist just before winning a 2017 special election. Trump had said during last month’s Montana stop that anyone who can do a body slam “is my kind of guy.” The president subsequently was criticized for seeming to glorify violence against journalists.

"HAMILTON—Antonio Pipkin threw a touchdown pass and ran for two others as the Montreal Alouettes held on for a 30-28 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the regular-season finale for both teams Saturday night. Montreal (5-13) earned its second straight win to finish third in the East Division standings ahead of the Toronto Argonauts (4-14). But the Alouettes will miss the CFL playoffs for the fourth straight year. Hamilton (8-10) came in having cemented second in the East Division and thus rested most of its starters, including quarterback Jeremiah Masoli. The Ticats host the B.C. Lions in the conference semifinal next Sunday riding a three-game losing streak. The Ticats had a shot at a last-second win, but Lirim Hajrullahu missed a field goal from 49 yards out on the game’s final play. Pipkin’s one-yard TD run at 14:24 of the third quarter staked Montreal to a 30-18 advantage. It was set up by Ty Cranston’s recovery of Terrell Sinkfield’s fumble on a kickoff at the Hamilton 19-yard line. Ticats quarterback Dane Evans, in his first CFL start, found Mike Jones on a 26-yard touchdown pass at 4:34 of the fourth. That cut the deficit to 30-25 before a generously announced Tim Hortons Field gathering of 23,381. Evans later drove Hamilton to the Montreal 19-yard line, but the Ticats had to settle for Hajrullahu’s 20-yard field goal at 12:42 of the fourth quarter to trim the Als’ lead to 30-28. Evans finished 22-of-37 passing for 315 yards with two TDs and two interceptions. Jones had five catches for 114 yards and the TD, Bralon Addison recorded seven receptions for 103 yards and a touchdown while John White ran for 88 yards on nine carries. Quarterback Johnny Manziel made his eighth start for Montreal. He completed four of five passes for 59 yards before giving way to Pipkin in the second quarter with the Alouettes leading 7-3. Pipkin finished 8-of-15 passing for 217 yards while rushing four times for 21 yards. Eugene Lewis had two catches for 105 yards and two TDs for Montreal while William Stanback registered four receptions for 100 yards. Hamilton cut Montreal’s lead to 20-18 on Sean Thomas-Erlington’s two-yard TD run at 5:26 of the third. But Boris Bede’s 43-yard field goal at 11:20 put the Alouettes ahead 23-18. Bede kicked three converts and a field goal for Montreal. Hajrullahu booted three converts, a single and two field goals. Pipkin hit Lewis with a 75-yard TD toss at 12:25 of the second to stake Montreal to a 20-11 halftime lead. He was sacked on the two-point convert. Hamilton narrowed Montreal’s lead to 14-11 on Evans’s 20-yard touchdown pass to Addison at 8:41. Hajrullahu followed up with a 72-yard single on the ensuing kickoff. Pipkin’s one-yard run at 3:47 of the second put Montreal ahead 14-3. The TD was awarded upon review after Pipkin was seemingly stopped on third-and-one. It came after Hajrullahu’s 22-yard field goal at 11:53 of the first. Manziel opened the scoring with a 30-yard TD strike to Lewis at 5:10 to cap a seven-play, 76-yard drive.

"For more than a decade, Carolyn Evans Hammond has been tasting, critiquing and writing about wine with the goal of helping readers find that perfect bottle for any occasion.  She is the author of two books,   and  . The latter book, which is being revised for republication in 2018, ranks the bestselling wines in the U.S. (popular big brands that are also available in Ontario) by grape variety and price up to $15 US. In October 2015, she began writing her own column in the Star following several years of freelancing to various international publications. In an era where online reviews for almost every product, including wine, are plentiful, why should readers trust Hammond’s judgment? We sat down with her to find out what she brings to the wine criticism scene.  I took a bit of an unconventional path. Though I was a journalist after university, my career in wine began in London, England, in 2002. That’s when I joined a boutique wine PR firm. London is the hub of the fine wine world so was a great learning ground. By day, I would organize tastings, lunch with top wine critics, and conduct press trips. By night, I would study wine. I earned my Intermediate, Advanced and Diploma certifications from the Wine and Spirit Education Trust. This constant immersion in the world of wine fired me up and gave me a deep, broad understanding of the beverage — as well as the business of it — from an international perspective.  In 2004, I quit wine PR to become a wine writer, contributing to many publications including Decanter, Wine Spectator, and Wine & Spirit International. And I moved to Toronto that same year.  I taste wine at home, at trade tastings, and in meetings with winemakers visiting Toronto to talk about their wines. I also travel as much as I can in order to visit wine regions because I’m filming a new television show about wine. These tastings inform my columns and help me scout out amazing wines. I only recommend wines that are bottles that offer stellar value for money. Then, I award the wines a score out of 100, and provide a lengthy tasting note to qualify that number. I think taking the time to carefully explain a wine’s character is just as important, if not more important, than its score. When I taste wine, I first taste quite technically — are there any flaws, imperfections? Are the structural components such as alcohol, acidity and tannins in balance with each other? Balance is very important. And are the hallmarks of quality — fruit concentration, complexity and length — showing sufficiently well to make the wine a good example of its type and price? In short, I’m looking for a shining example of a wine style that offers terrific value for money.  Once I’ve found that, I try to translate my understanding of the wine into a tasting note everyone can appreciate; one that conveys the wine’s charms and communicates how pouring it could enhance a lifestyle.  I’m a big believer that drinking well doesn’t have to be pricey or pretentious; it just takes a little know-how and maybe a corkscrew. Sure, there’s a time to drop serious coin on a crazy special bottle, but that’s not every day. So most of my recommendations don’t cost a fortune.  And today’s fiercely competitive, global wine world keeps pushing quality up and weeding out mediocrity. So you really don’t need to spend a fortune to get a delicious drop of wine.  I’m here to guide wine drinkers toward their next great pour. The short answer is, price matters. For example, a $10 Californian Cabernet isn’t the same thing as a $100 one, so they shouldn’t be judged by same yardstick. The same thing holds true for Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and all the rest. Comparing apples to apples is the fairest approach, which my scoring reflects. Otherwise, it’s too easy to overlook inexpensive wines entirely, which is ridiculously unfair and a huge disservice to wine drinkers. Prices of wine in Ontario are already quite high relative to many other places, and marketing puts pressure on consumers to trade-up. So wine drinkers need a trusted critic to scout out the best value bottles on shelves.  In September, I paired wines with five former TIFF films — including   and  . My intent was to honour TIFF’s ethos of inclusivity and staunch refusal to shy away from tough social issues; I think these are important movies to watch. I was in no way trying to diminish or soften the very serious, complex and challenging issues so well addressed in these films. That was certainly not my intent. And I sincerely apologize for any offence or hurt my words may have caused. ",0,How the Star’s wine critic helps readers find that perfect bottle
"LAS VEGAS—Bryson DeChambeau birdied four of the last six holes Saturday for a share of the lead with Peter Uihlein in the Shriners Hospitals For Children Open. DeChambeau shot a 6-under 66 to match Uihlein at 16-under 197 at TPC Summerlin. “Definitely nice to be able to ball strike it as well as I have the past three days,” DeChambeau said. “Nice to be able to take two weeks — or three, four weeks off. I don’t know how many weeks I was off. It’s nice to not know essentially coming into an event and still be able to perform. That’s something I’ll take with me moving forward.” The leader after each of the first two rounds, Uihlein had a 68. He’s winless on the PGA Tour. “I wouldn’t really say I was overly frustrated,” Uihlein said. “I didn’t feel like I hit it probably close enough as I probably could have to feel like, ‘Hey, these are really makable.’ I didn’t feel like I missed any putts I should have made.” Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., the lone Canadian to make the cut, is tied for 19th at 9 under. He shot a 6-under 65 on Saturday. DeChambeau has four PGA Tour victories, winning three times last season. “Still not seeing the line as well as I would like to,” DeChambeau said. “It’s all visual. If I start seeing it really well, watch out. But if I don’t see it well it’s a struggle. I’m going to go work on that and try and make that better for tomorrow.” Lucas Glover was a stroke back after a 61 that he capped with his second eagle of the day. He eagled the par-5 13th on his opening nine, and closed with another eagle on the par-5 ninth. “Made some putts,” Glover said. “I started out with a bogey on 10, actually. Hit a good putt, just misread a 4-foot slider. Made everything else, that’s for sure. Couple eagles on the par-5s. Holed it like a bucket. One of those days.” Glover matched his career best and was a stroke off the course record set by J.J. Henry in 2014 and matched by Rod Pampling in 2017. Chip Beck shot a tournament-record 59 in 1991 at Sunrise. “I like playing here,” Glover said. “It’s kind of target golf, but I’ve always enjoyed coming here.” Defending champion Patrick Cantlay had a 63 to join Robert Streb (68) at 14 under. Jordan Spieth remained 8 under in his season debut, shooting even-par 71. ",0,"Bryson DeChambeau, Peter Uihlein share Las Vegas lead"
"PITTSBURGH—The Maple Leafs used their speed, they used their savvy, they used their skill and they got the reward they wanted in a 5-0 win Saturday night over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Two goals from Morgan Rielly — including one on a late third-period power play — as well as singles from John Tavares, Patrick Marleau and Zach Hyman (short-handed) combined for the Toronto offence. The Leafs ended a two-game losing skid as they looked to get back some of the mojo that seemed missing this week in losses to Calgary and Dallas. The Penguins were a formidable opponent, atop the Metropolitan Division when the day began. But the Leafs were on top of them from the beginning, and used their speed better. Frederik Andersen stopped all 31 shots for his first shutout of the season. It was the sixth game in a row Andersen has allowed two or fewer goals against. Marner was sublimely dangerous all night, eluding Pittsburgh defenders. At one point, he killed off the end of a penalty to Nazem Kadri just by holding on to the puck in the Penguins zone, with five players in black and gold around him, happy it seemed, just to contain him. Three Leafs had two-point nights: Marner and Kasperi Kapanen each had two assists and Tavares also had an assist to go along with his goal. A game after being a healthy scratch, Igor Ozhiganov took two minor penalties. Marner got a puck caught in his skate — literally in the casing between the blade and the boot — during a second-period power play.

"LOUISVILLE, KY.—Accelerate took the lead at the top of the stretch and held off Gunnevera to win the $6-million (U.S.) Breeders’ Cup Classic by a length Saturday, strengthening his bid for Horse of the Year over Triple Crown winner Justify. The race lacked the retired Justify and left a wide-open field, which the chestnut 5-year-old horse eventually overtook after breaking from the No. 14 post as the favourite. Accelerate made a sweeping move in the far turn and was in charge at the top of the stretch, then held off Gunnevera for his fifth consecutive Grade 1 victory and sixth of seven overall this year. That gave trainer John Sadler his first Breeders’ Cup win since his initial starter 30 years ago. As for Accelerate being named this year’s top thoroughbred, Sadler said he’d leave that up to the sports writers who vote on the Eclipse Awards. He noted his own bias, though. “To me, he’s the Horse of the Year, no doubt,” Sadler said. “He’s won all those great races. To win the Santa Anita Handicap (in March) was for me probably one or two on my bucket list. “The Classic is a newer race but a great race, and he won that so smashingly. He’s just a great horse and had a great year.” Ridden by Joel Rosario, Accelerate covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02.93 and paid $7.40, $6 and $4.40. “He broke really well,” Rosario said of Accelerate. “I was on the outside and had to use him a little bit. I just wanted to get a position because I was way out there. I know I had a long run to the turn but I wanted to be not too wide. “When I got to the backside I tried to be in the clear, which is what he likes to do.” The Classic triumph capped a successful Breeders’ Cup for the jockey, who also rode Game Winner and Jaywalk to victories on Friday in the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies Turf, respectively. Gunnevera returned $21.80 and $11.80, while Thunder Snow paid $8 in redeeming himself at Churchill Downs after a last-place finish in the 2017 Kentucky Derby. Off the board were Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert’s duo of West Coast and McKinzie. They finished seventh and 12th, respectively, after projections of challenging Accelerate in the marquee race of the season-ending championships. Gunnevera, Thunder Snow and early pace setter Mendelssohn made things interesting in a wide-open field, an upside to the absence of horse racing’s 13th Triple Crown winner from the Classic. Justify’s ankle issue led Baffert to retire the 3-year-old in July, eliminating the opportunity to follow 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in pursuit of a rare grand slam. Accelerate claimed his fourth race in a row and answered the question of if he could continue his roll after beating West Coast by 2 1/4 lengths in the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita. And it followed other notable performances on the second day of the $30-million championships. Monomoy Girl bolstered her case as the top 3-year-old filly by winning the $2 million Distaff. The anticipated duel between the reigning Kentucky Oaks winner and her 2017 predecessor Abel Tasman never materialized, as Monomoy Girl made her move at the final turn and held off Wow Cat by a length for her sixth victory this season. Peter Miller made Breeders’ Cup history as the first trainer to saddle two repeat winners in the same Breeders’ Cup races. Soon after Stormy Liberal outdueled favourite World of Trouble to retake the Turf Sprint by a neck, 6-year-old Roy H swept past Promises Fulfilled and flew to a 3 1/4-length win in the Sprint. Jockey Paco Lopez earned his first Breeders’ Cup victory. Enable followed up last month’s Arc de Triomphe victory by winning the $4 million Turf by 3/4 lengths over Magical. The 4-year-old British filly became the first horse to win both prestigious races in the same year. She earned her 10th win from 11 career starts.

"LOS ANGELES—Things tend to get a bit overhyped where   are concerned so early in this season of great expectations after a blistering start. The second game of the season  ? Some saw it as a “statement” game more than just another regular-season outing. Philadelphia comes to Toronto to visit? Another benchmark against a top conference rival. Milwaukee? Much the same. And now, for just one of two times this season, LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are on tap, Kawhi Leonard is back in his hometown — and that’s going to be a delightful story next summer — but his free agent desires will be an underlying storyline Sunday and the attention is once again ramped up. It may fizzle before it can even manifest itself on the court. Leonard is listed as questionable for Sunday’s game here because of a foot he “jammed” late in Friday’s win over Phoenix. Leonard went through parts of practice at UCLA on Saturday — “I did everything I wanted to do,” he said — but there won’t be a final determination on his availability until much closer to the 9:30 p.m. ET tipoff. “That’s what we do the rest of (Saturday) here, is they evaluate him and talk to him, and he’s smart and experienced and knows his body better than anybody,” said assistant coach Nate Bjorkgren, speaking with reporters in place of the laryngitis-plagued Nick Nurse. “It was just a jammed foot, and we’ll go from there.” If Leonard can’t play it will rob fans of one of two chances to see him play against James this season, renewing a confrontation that included NBA Finals matchups between Leonard’s San Antonio Spurs and James’ Miami Heat in 2013 and 2014. That would be a shame, even if it would occur in the flow of a team game. “During the course of the game, you see our team do this all the time, there’s lots of different matchups that happen,” Bjorkgren said. “They happen in transition, they happen out of timeouts. So you’ll see a number of different guys on him, mixing that up, and that goes for everybody that’s out there on the floor.” Leonard has given Toronto its best predatory individual defender in years, a quick, long and athletic wing who has the ability to anticipate plays and disrupt them. His oft-seen backwards, blind dive to register a no-look steal against Minnesota is already etched in franchise lore. His treatment of Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons was borderline cruel, Leonard’s long reach and disruptive ability paid greatly into 11 Simmons turnovers in one game. “We want to be an aggressive defensive team, get our hands on some balls out there, get some deflections, get into transition in the open court and get some open threes or layups,” Leonard said after Toronto had dispatched the Phoenix Suns to run their season record to an all-time franchise best 8-1. The Raptors know a Leonard-James matchup will make fans drool, regardless of the fact the Lakers are stumbling out of the gate this season and the Raptors sport one of   in the league. But they also know it’s a much more complicated endeavour than saying, ‘Go, Leonard, guard the most dominant player in the game for the entire night.’ “That’s why we can allow him to play one-on-one,” said Danny Green. “You’ve got guys like Kawhi that can guard and some of the other guys that can switch down the line like OG, Pascal, Serge who can guard out on the floor, and you have bigs or guards, big co-ordinated guards who can guard guys like that, it helps a ton. “Obviously, it’s hard to stop (LeBron) 1-on-1 regardless, but you just want to make him beat you by himself and not let other guys get involved because that’s when it becomes a problem. You know he’s going to get his points, but when other guys start stepping up and scoring 20, 15 here and there, that’s what hurts your team.  “You want to limit those as much as possible.” ",0,Defending LeBron will be a team effort for the Toronto Raptors
"VANCOUVER—A new logo and brand identity for the BC Liberals was unveiled at this weekend’s convention, which centred on opposition against proportional representation. Wilkinson,  , made the keynote address at the B.C. Liberal party convention — his first as leader — on Saturday in Vancouver at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre. The Vancouver convention was the first with Andrew Wilkinson at the helm since being elected party leader in February. A new slogan, “Opportunity for all of B.C.,’ and new logo was chosen by a committee. Directly following a rally opposing proportional representation, Wilkinson said in his keynote that the electoral referendum lacked information and that the “vast majority” of people did not understand the option. He also and expressed criticism that the ballot was not just a yes or no question, which he said was “promised” by the NDP government.  In response to a reporter question, Wilkinson he speculated that the confusion was part of the NDP’S political strategy. “The awareness level in this province is very low, the information level is very low and we are concerned the NDP set it up that way,” he said. When Wilkinson was asked why his party used an alternative vote system instead of first past the post to elect their leader in February, he responded that the alternative ballot system used to win the BC Liberal leadership race was “not Pro Rep” and was commonly used in other governments.  “Its routine in leadership campaigns for parties throughout the Commonwealth … It ensures the majority of the party are comfortable supporting one particular candidate,” he said of the alternative ballot method. The rally before his keynote also featured BC Liberal MLA taking to the stage to oppose proportional representation, with MLA John Martin lead the crowd in a chant, with one side saying “stacked deck” and the other “rigged game.”  Ravi Kahlon, an NDP MLA who was there to observe the vent, said that the BC Liberal opposition to pro rep contained “mixed messages.”  “Having a system like pro rep to elect their leader is good enough for the BC Liberals but for some reason not good enough for the public,” he said. He said that he was confident that people in B.C. understand the referendum and that Elections BC is providing the information needed. “Elections BC is doing a good job in trying to educate the public on all their options, I have faith in the public.”  The presence of Kahlon and another NDP staffer were publicly announced at the rally, which Kahlon said he thought was “odd” move but appreciated the civility Liberal members showed him.  “I suppose in the Trump era, this is becoming something of a normal thing … to heckle the opposition,” he said, adding that he was grateful there were “no boos.” In his keynote, Wilkinson said that his priorities were cutting taxes and creating job opportunities, promising to get rid of the NDP government’s “18 new taxes” that have been introduced since they took on leadership. Wilkinson also pointed to the benefits of investing in the natural resource industry, lauding the work of the previous government under Christy Clark and promising to promote more investment into the industry.

" – Exactly 40 years ago this week the Toronto Star launched its first short story contest. At the time organizers had little idea of how many people might enter – or how long the contest might last. They reasoned that if only a handful of aspiring writers bothered to see if they had what it takes to be a published author, then the contest could easily be scrapped the next year. To their delight, though, hundreds of people – from professional authors to those with little or no writing experience – entered the contest. Today, 40 years later, the Toronto Star Short Story Contest has grown to the point where it is now the biggest contest of its kind in Canada and one of the largest in North America, attracting approximately 2,000 entries each year. Starting Saturday, January 6, the Star is launching its latest contest, providing writers the opportunity to see their story published in Canada’s largest newspaper and to study with some of the top creative writing teachers in the country. The 2018 Short Story Contest is open to anyone 16 years of age or older who lives in Ontario. The annual contest is co-sponsored by the Toronto Public Library and the Humber School for Writers. All submissions must be received by 5 p.m., Wednesday, February 28, 2017. The first-place winner will receive a $5,000 cash prize plus a creative writing course from The Humber School for Writers. The winner can choose either a 30-week creative writing correspondence program at Humber, which has an approximate value of $3,000, or a week-long summer workshop at Humber’s Lakeshore campus in Toronto, which has an approximate value of $1,000. In addition, the second-place winner will receive a cash prize of $2,000 and the third-place winner will get $1,000. Entrants can write on any topic they want. Stories must be original, previously unpublished and no longer than 2,500 words. Entries are limited to one per person. There is no fee to enter the contest. The Toronto Public Library has been a partner with the Star in presenting the contest for the last nine years. This is the seventh straight year that the Humber School for Writers has also been a contest partner. “The Toronto Star Short Story Contest is always an exciting library partnership where we can see with our own eyes our local writing talent,” said Vickery Bowles, City Librarian of the Toronto Public Library. “The stories we read each year move us, make us laugh and open us up to all kinds of new worlds.” A Humber School for Writers’ panel will read all of the entries and narrow the submissions to a short list of 25-30 stories. The winners will be selected from the short list by a panel of distinguished judges, including Bowles, award-winning author and journalist Kamal Al-Solaylee, Toronto Star books editor Deborah Dundas and theatre critic and author Richard Ouzounian. Winners will be announced in April and their stories will be published in full in the Toronto Star.

" – The Toronto Star and La Presse announced today they will assume responsibility for all digital advertising sales of thestar.com and lapresse.ca respectively, effective January 1, 2016.   The move will allow both the Toronto Star and La Presse to consolidate and reposition their digital advertising businesses, allowing them to better serve advertisers by providing enhanced opportunities to cross-sell and bundle their media properties. As a result, Square Victoria Digital Properties (La Presse) and Star Media Group (Toronto Star) will cease operations of Olive Media, their joint venture. The decision means Olive Media, which has operated as a partnership since January, 2007, will cease to operate as a stand-alone organization starting January 1, 2016. La Presse and Star Metro Media, a division of Star Media Group that handles advertising sales for the Toronto Star will be absorbing some of the operational staff and technology in Montreal and Toronto in order to continue providing the excellent level of service that advertisers have come to expect when advertising on lapresse.ca and thestar.com. Olive Media’s remaining partners and products will be transitioned to those partners’ in-house sales teams. “This is the natural progression of our digital strategy, said Pierre-Elliott Levasseur, COO of La Presse. With the continued innovation of the La Presse digital platforms, it now becomes strategically necessary to assume responsibility for all our digital advertising sales in-house. This move enables accelerated innovation of our advertising products across all platforms.”  “This is an important step forward in our business strategy,” said John Cruickshank, Publisher of the Toronto Star and President of Star Media Group. “It means we will be able to continue to provide the same excellent service to our advertisers and allow them to purchase media across all Star Media Group brands and platforms from a single, dedicated sales force.” Olive Media, which has offices in Toronto and Montreal, is a digital marketing solutions provider, allowing publishers and partners the opportunity to maximize their Canadian online advertising revenues through exclusive Canadian market representation. Olive Media is a partnership between Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. and Square Victoria Digital Properties Inc., a subsidiary of Power Corporation, which also owns La Presse through its subsidiary Groupe Gesca. The change will affect about 70 employees in Toronto and 12 employees in Montreal.

"New legislation has passed that will force employers to publish salary ranges in a move meant to help narrow the gender pay gap. Bill 3, the Pay Transparency Act, also means companies cannot ask potential employees about their pay history.  Firms will also have to report salaries to the ministry, broken down by gender and other factors. “We’re the first province in all of Canada ... to introduce a comprehensive package of measures that’s going to increase pay transparency,” Labour Minister Kevin Flynn said in the legislature last week.  “The legislation is a new tool in our tool kit. It’s going to promote workplace equity. It’s going to shine a light on pay inequity and on biases, and it’s going to help employers to eliminate them.” On average, women earn about 30 per cent less than men, a number that has not changed in the past decade, the government says.  The bill passed third reading last week, with the support of the NDP. Progressive Conservative MPPs in attendance voted against. The government made some changes to the bill after hearing concerns that only public sector and large employers — those with 250-plus employees — would be covered. Now, companies with 100 or more employees are included, which will cover about 70 per cent of workers in the province.  Companies will have to report their pay practices within their workplace, as well as to the Ministry of Labour. The Equal Pay Coalition was pleased the law was boosted with “clear deadlines for filing reports” and a no-exemption rule.  ",0,Ontario passes gender pay transparency law
"For working journalists, the “global trust crisis” that has resulted in trust in media dropping to all-time lows often feels personal. We know many people distrust journalists because so many people in both our professional and personal lives do not hesitate to tell us so. We understand there is a credibility crisis in media overall and that individual journalists and news organizations must answer for the shortfalls — both real and perceived — in journalism. Recently, in response to yet another dismal study about plunging media trust, I asked readers to tell me what you want to know about the Star’s journalism. That resulted in more than 200 thoughtful responses that pointed to a significant gap in understanding and many good questions about what the Star’s journalists do daily to bring you news, commentary and other credible information. While I will continue to address these vital media literacy matters in future columns, I am pleased to tell you that the Star’s newsroom has stepped up with an important new initiative aimed at increasing the trust readers have in the Star and creating greater understanding of the Star’s journalism. Managing Editor Irene Gentle has initiated an interdepartmental “trust committee” to look into how the Star can foster greater reader trust and develop journalistic and technological tools to bridge the trust and media literacy gap. As the Star’s “reader advocate,” I am happy to have opportunity to participate in the committee to share the ongoing reader concerns that come to the public editor’s office. The committee, chaired by senior editor Mary Vallis, held its first meeting last week. The first order of business? Rightly, ask readers themselves: What do you think the Star should do to create a stronger bond of trust in its journalism?  We have set up an email address —   — and encourage your thoughts. Gentle believes this focus on reader trust will be “among the most important work we do this year. “This initiative is the next step to deepen that commitment with Star readers and discover new ways to give the skeptical good reasons to believe in our work too” she said. “It starts with us learning the various ways people are losing faith with what we do and addressing it. “We feel strongly in the newsroom that we have a responsibility to address this credibility gap, transparently and non-defensively. It starts with us, whether it means telling the story behind the story in a clear and open way, or addressing the small errors, such as typos or a missed street name, that make people doubt our accuracy on the larger issues. “There is a real disconnect between the lengths we go to at the Star — to verify sources, confirm facts, ensure people have the right to respond to allegations about them, to be fair and accurate, legally and ethically onside — and what some people see and believe. “Anyone in a newsroom knows how hard journalists work to get great stories, and get them right. And anyone who works in a newsroom also knows how completely inadequate we have been in telling that part of our story,” she added. “We know this because people are telling us: In our own personal lives, with friends or family or neighbours, we hear the distrust in our industry, in general, and sometimes with our organization specifically.” Trust in a news organization’s journalism is at the heart of the relationship between it and its readers. As I have often said, our core product is not the news, it is credibility. Who are you going to trust to tell you what happens in your world, what matters and why it matters are essential questions of our digital era and its disruption of journalism and the media industry. Indeed, a report released last year by the Media Insight Project — an initiative of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, indicates trust may well be a key factor forward in the survival of the media business. “It’s not only a journalistic aspiration, but a business imperative,” the report on what makes people trust and rely on news stated. “People who put a higher premium on trust related factors are more engaged with news, are more likely to pay for it, install news apps, or share and promote news with their friends.” So, tell us: What would enhance your trust in the Star’s journalism — in the newspaper, on its website and its news apps? What is the Star doing right to build trust? What can it do better? Send your responses to  . As always, please be constructive and civil.

"As the Star reported this week, the Toronto District School Board says it never discussed the implications of allowing an 11-year-old girl to speak to a barrage of reporters after she had made false allegations that her hijab had been cut. It was “not part of the conversation,” TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star on Tuesday. In the interests of transparency, I think it only fair that the Star disclose that there was never any conversation in our newsroom about whether to publish the girl’s name and photographs of her taken at the school board. The Star has no explicit policies on interviewing or identifying children. Its relatively vague guidelines on children are expressed in our standards manual in a section on privacy: “Children and teenagers — particularly those under the age of 16 who may not fully understand the implications of speaking to the media — command a special sensitivity,” it states. As well, it advises that photographers “should be sensitive when photographing children under 16 without permission of a parent or guardian.” In practice, I know that the newsroom often debates and discusses issues related to children in the news and is particularly sensitive to this when children are victims of crime. So why didn’t that conversation happen here in this case? Why was no consideration whatsoever given to the possibility of shielding this child’s identity from public view? The answer is simple and, to me, understandable: This girl’s speaking before media at the school board offices, with school board officials and her mother present, provided sanction for the Star and other media outlets to identify her. As editor Michael Cooke told me: “The girl was put forward by responsible and caring adults, including her mother. That was enough for me.” Parental permission to identify children in the news is indeed a significant factor in any judgment call on this issue and is generally the standard stated in those ethics codes that provide specific guidelines on covering children, including Britain’s Editor’s Code of Practice. In a statement to the media Wednesday, the family said it chose to make the story public, “horrified that there was such a perpetrator who may try to harm someone else.” The mother made clear that at that time, she too believed her daughter’s story. The family has declined the Star’s requests for interviews and expressed its “sincere apologies to every Canadian.” After Toronto police reported Monday morning that investigators had determined the attack did not happen, the Star decided not to name the girl. I believe that is the right decision and further, that we should consider removing her name from last week’s news reports so this story is not connected to her online identity for the rest of her life. Whatever happened — and it would seem this child told quite a lie — we must remember that she is just a child. Had that public event at the girl’s school — in effect, a press conference with her mother and her speaking to media — not occurred, it’s likely the initial story would have been limited to reporting what Toronto police had said in the news release that first alerted media to what then was presented as a shocking story for our community. That release, which did not provide the child’s name, reported that an 11-year-old girl was walking to school when she was approached from behind by a man who pulled the hood off her jacket and then cut her hijab with a pair of scissors. “This is being investigated as a hate crime,” stated that news release, which also included a detailed description of the man. While the girl’s story was found to be false, this was not “fake news” as some critics have charged. The breaking news reports were based on information from reliable sources: an official police news release about a hate crime investigation involving a child, and an invitation by the school board for the media to talk to the girl with her mother presiding. On the face of it — based on what those valid sources said at that time, and the rush to condemnation by politicians at all levels of government — this was real news. And now that we know it is not true, all of the institutions involved — including the media — are left to ask ourselves what lessons can be learned here. For my part, I hope this sparks deeper conversation in the media about specific rules on covering and naming children in the digital age. On that, I was alerted this week to a 2004    , an associate professor at Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies, entitled “Covering Kids: Are journalists guilty of exploiting children?” (Full disclosure: the faculty awarded me a teaching fellowship and I’m now teaching a graduate course on critical issues in media literacy.) Smith Fullerton examines how media might better assure that children’s stories are told in a responsible, ethical manner and raises the uncomfortable idea that parents might not always know what is best for their children — or fully understand the implications — when it comes to putting them forward to the media. As she states, in making a strong case that children deserve special care and attention by the media, “few journalists or media outlets rigorously or systematically consider what coverage may mean for children and very few have detailed protocols about interacting with minors.” Smith Fullerton contends that the media should consider more rigorous consent protocols similar to those required by academic researchers who interview children. She acknowledges the difficulty of this for newsrooms, particularly in breaking news situations. I agree that the detailed protocols demanded in academia are likely unworkable in the newsroom. But I am aligned with her greater point that “media outlets need to develop valid, respectful and specific procedures for covering children,” and we have some responsibility to make sure parents understand the implications of media coverage of their children. Children are vulnerable sources and the implications of any news coverage involving them should always be part of the conversation. ",0,Children in the news always require special consideration 
"Folks: This is Journalism 101 — be skeptical. “If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out,” states an age-old adage preached to generations of journalists. Believe nothing at face value; verify what sources say; check and double check. That is what we call due diligence in journalism. This is a core value of the Star’s journalistic standards. I am not the first journalist to say that the Washington Post provided journalists and readers at large alike with a textbook example this week of due diligence at work in journalism. Call this the triumph of real reporting. The   about having been impregnated when she was a teenager by Alabama’s Senate candidate Roy Moore, deserves all the accolades it has received for ultimately exposing a scheme to deceive and embarrass that news organization and, in so doing, showing why journalistic standards matter. As the Post reported, a woman approached its reporters to share a dramatic story about an alleged affair with Moore that led to an abortion when she was 15. Had it been true, this would have indeed been big news. Here is what bears understanding here. Real reporters do not simply publish what anyone tells them, no matter how dramatic the story presented. Real reporting demands that journalists always take steps to verify what sources tell them, check out the reliability of all sources, seek documentation to back up what sources tell them, ask questions, go back and ask more questions. The Post reporters were straight with the woman about their fact-checking process, even as the woman pushed them to give their opinion about Moore and whether the story could bring down his candidacy. In checking out the woman’s story, inconsistencies emerged. Further checking of public records and internet searches uncovered information indicating the woman quite likely worked for Project Veritas, an organization that aims to discredit journalists and mainstream media outlets by trying to trick them into publishing hoax stories and admitting to biased reporting. But, here, the Post turned the tables and exposed the attempted sting with a first-rate investigative sting operation of its own, in which it confronted the woman with the facts while a hidden camera captured it all on video. Then, the Post published its tour de force report detailing its meticulous reporting about how it discovered the truth about the woman and Project Veritas. That report also serves as a master class in the journalistic transparency today’s media environment demands. The Post explained its standards to readers, telling them why it had secretly photographed the woman and why it reported her previous off-the-record comments. “We always honour ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, the Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. . . . We can’t honour an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.” All of this was journalistic rigour writ large, a prime example of what reporters and editors at serious news organizations like the Star do daily in meeting the standards required by the law and our longstanding ethics policies. While it is disconcerting that individuals and organizations would seek to trick the media into publishing false information — and journalists quite rightly fear being taken in by such hoaxes — we believe that the strong standards of due diligence in which we hold our journalists provides significant protection against our publishing such blatantly bogus information.  “This is how good journalists do their jobs and how they don’t get taken in by hoaxes,” Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and an expert in media law, said in an  . “It’s such an important lesson.” Indeed, as Post writer Callum Borchers, who covers the intersection of media and politics,  , journalistic vetting — the essence of what we do — prevented a false claim from being published: “A Project Veritas plot designed to embarrass the media by exposing recklessness demonstrated the media’s care instead.” In a world in which a previously unimaginable amount of misinformation and disinformation go viral every day, trustworthy journalism from journalists and news organizations that hold themselves to high professional standards and do the real work of reporting to verify facts matters more than ever. The lessons learned here are important reminders for journalists and citizens alike: Just because someone says it’s true, does not make it so. ",0,Journalistic standards protect against fake news
"Journalism’s history of undercover reporting is fraught with contradiction. On one hand, some of the most celebrated reporting of the past century or so resulted from courageous reporters who went undercover to expose injustices and wrongdoing. On the other hand, is the fact that journalism’s core value is truth. How can lying to get a story be reconciled with that value? Like so many ethical issues in journalism, this is not a black and white issue. Journalist’s first obligation is to seek truth and report it. But there are some circumstances when truth can only be discovered by means of deception. In such cases, the overriding value is the public interest. Did the ends justify the means of the Star’s   for a month at Fiera Foods, one of Toronto’s largest industrial bakeries, to expose working conditions for precarious workers who rely on temp agencies to find work? In my view, this was most certainly justified. The   makes clear that undercover reporting is a tool of last resort, to be used following extensive consideration at the newsroom’s highest level: “Undercover reporting, photography and surveillance video should be used rarely and a case must be made that the story to be uncovered is of high public interest,” the policy states. In practice, approval for undercover reporting is given only when reporters and senior editors have determined that the story could not be obtained by other means. Here, editor Michael Cooke and managing editor Irene Gentle made the judgment call to allow Mojtehedzadeh to go undercover. They concluded there was indeed no other way to get this information, and most important, that this was a story of strong public interest. Mojtehedzadeh had spent many months investigating temp agencies, seeking information about injustices to some of our community’s most vulnerable workers. In reading through hundreds of Ministry of Labour reports and court documents on workers’ injuries she found numerous references to heath and safety violations at Fiera Foods Company and Marmora Freezing Corporation, one of its partner companies. She also discovered three deaths had occurred at Fiera or in affiliated companies. The most recent happened last year when 23-year-old   when her hijab was pulled into a machine as she worked on an assembly line near the conveyer belt. Diaby was hired through a temp agency and had been working at Fiera Foods for two weeks. “We looked at all of the information and concluded that my going undercover as a temp worker was the only way to get this story. We couldn’t just ask precarious temp workers to tell us what is happening inside the factory,” Mojtehedzadeh told me this week. “In past, I have had cases of temp workers who were fired for speaking up to the Star and I did not want to put anyone at risk of losing their job. “All of the injury data and the deaths made it clear there was a strong public interest here in the health and safety of temp workers.” Fiera Foods has also benefited from public funding, having received some $4.7 million dollars in government loans and grants. In response to questions from the Star, the company said that health and safety is a “core principle.”  Following publication of the Star's investigation, Fiera Foods this week was fined $300,000 after pleading guilty to charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act related to Diaby’s death. As well, the company told the Star it has hired auditors to examine its health and safety practices and temp agency contracts.  If you have not read   by Mojtehedzadeh and Brendan Kennedy, who came into the project to provide further reporting, I hope you do so. Like many readers, I was stunned at what was revealed about the work conditions for these vulnerable workers, both through the undercover reporting and the more “classic” means of obtaining information. Arguably, undercover reporting is itself a classic reporting technique. In the 2012 book,  , author   argues that undercover work embodies a central discipline of good reporting: “the ability to extract significant information or to create indelible, real-time descriptions of hard-to-penetrate institutions or social situations that deserve the public’s attention.” The New York University journalism professor has compiled an online   that provides many example of outstanding undercover reporting (including some past Toronto Star investigations) and numerous thought-provoking articles about the ethics of journalistic deception. Star editor Michael Cooke believes strongly that “undercover reporting has a long and noble history and is often courageous work that takes perseverance. “Look no further than  ,” he said, referring to the legendary reporter who went undercover as a patient in a New York insane asylum in the late 1800s. “Her   of the dreadful conditions and treatment of the patients got action, fast. So Bly made life better for the mentally ill,” Cooke said. “And that’s what it’s all about … trying to make life better.” ",0,The public interest and the ethics of undercover reporting: Public Editor
"An important reader question about The   states that, “The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names.” When that is not possible and confidential sources — individuals who are not named in the Star — are used in reporting information deemed to be of public interest, the Star’s reporters must take steps to determine the reliability of these sources. This is responsible reporting. In all cases, reporters, and most often their editors too, know the identities of sources granted anonymity in the Star. Given the ongoing debate about the use of confidential sources in covering Donald Trump’s administration, I have asked the bureau chiefs of the Star’s three Canadian political bureaus to provide their insights on the reader’s question as it pertains to the Star’s political and government coverage. Here are their thoughtful responses. “First off, a confidential source is generally someone we know very well and have a track record with and built on a relationship usually over years. We’ve assured ourselves that they are in a position to know the information they are giving us and that they have a track record of playing straight. Remember the trust cuts both ways. Not only do we have to trust them but they have to trust us. The source has to absolutely be in a position to know what they are talking about. No second-hand information or gossip. A bottom line is that any information gleaned this way must be fact-based. We don’t allow someone to anonymously trash another individual. That’s just a cheap shot. Typically, our sources in Ottawa tend to be government officials who cannot speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the information they are passing. To be found out would put their job in jeopardy. These could be whistleblowers or other insiders whose information may reveal truths that the politicians are attempting to hide. We have to be alert to the motives of the source in providing the information. Usually the passing of information works to their favour in some way too, perhaps by building profile of a story. But we need to do a gut check to understand their motives.” “In political reporting, granting anonymity to a source is often a necessity in order to get them to say anything beyond boilerplate talking points. As we have seen from The New York Times’ superb reporting on the current president, off-the-record sources are essential to understanding what is going on in the White House. These people sometimes risk their jobs and reputations to speak to the Star. Yes, their motivations are not always altruistic — though we do hear from whistle-blowers in politics — but the insights can be invaluable. There are many important stories that would never have been exposed without allowing people to speak on background. Toronto Star readers should trust the confidential sources they see in the Star because Toronto Star reporters do. I do think we need to explain in stories why we are giving sources the right to withhold their names.” “When thinking about whether to use a confidential source I consider whether the information is of sufficient public interest to justify giving somebody anonymity. How trustworthy is the source? I never use a confidential source unless I know and trust them from past experience. Anybody who has steered me wrong in the past cannot be trusted with a cloak of anonymity. Even if I trust them, what are their motivations? What they are saying might be true but I have to have a good sense of why they are doing it to feel comfortable with keeping their identity secret. For example, I will never quote an anonymous source throwing political muck at somebody else. I see this in print often and I cringe because that is essentially helping somebody be a vandal, taking shots without putting their name behind it. Is there any way I can get the information without using a confidential source? If so, even if it means waiting a day or a two, I will wait. I don’t pretend that I look at this checklist every time I consider use of a confidential source, but all these considerations go through my mind. People put themselves in peril trusting me to keep their identity confidential and readers trust the Star to provide them information that is reliable and important. I don’t take any of that lightly.” ",0,Reader trust and responsible reporting with anonymous sources: Public Editor
"There is nothing new about critical readers expressing their concerns about what they read in the Star in strong words. My in-box, and those of most other journalists here, is evidence of that. What is new in recent weeks however is the fact some of those critics are increasingly hurling a new term of insult our way to express disdain about what they read in the Toronto Star: Fake News. We are seeing this degrading label now in emails, in Facebook and Instagram comments and in tweets directed at the Star and its journalists. “Go report some real news and stop contributing to fake news,” one such reader told Daniel Dale, the Star’s Washington correspondent. “Sounds like an alternative fact to me. Fake news,” said a reader who disagreed with a report on road tolls written by David Rider, the Star’s City Hall bureau chief. “More fake news from the Toronto Star. Sad,” said a reader critical of a Washington Post wire service report about President Donald Trump’s first week in office. “Sadly, your biased, incorrect and fake news is the reason your newspaper is struggling,” another told me. “Readers want facts.” Here are the facts: The charge of “fake news” is now being thrown at the mainstream media, by largely partisan critics, as an all-encompassing derisive epithet, largely devoid of its original, and accurate, meaning. The new U.S. president and his followers have clearly co-opted these words in their campaign to delegitimize the press and discredit legitimate reporting that seeks to hold the new administration to account — as journalists should and must in upholding their responsibilities within a democracy. Want more facts? Fake news is not news you happen to disagree with. And nor is it news from responsible news organizations that includes mistakes, made honestly and corrected honestly in line with the journalistic commitment to accuracy and fairness. Unfortunately, I have seen this insult used in regard to the Star’s journalism in both of these circumstances, in some cases from people I would have expected to know better, such as a university journalism professor and a former newspaper publisher. While real fake news is a matter of legitimate concern, the distinction about what is and is not fake news matters much in this troubling time when we face an assault on truth and daily debate about facts and “alternative facts” in what is increasingly coming to be regarded as a “post-truth world.” Easy, derisive labels that allow critics to dismiss outright information they disagree with, or news reports they regard as substandard, seem to me to be dangerously reductive.  So, what is fake news? To answer that accurately, we must look to Craig Silverman the Canadian journalist who first wrote about the phenomena of fake news for BuzzFeed News in November. Silverman, who has achieved global recognition for this important work, exposed the reality of fraudulent news, deliberately created and shared, largely on Facebook, to gain advertising dollars. Much of what he discovered was pro-Trump fake news that cast his opponent, Hillary Clinton, in a negative light with clearly false information. Silverman’s reporting provided a fascinating look into the digital media universe and the ease with which wholly made-up “news” could be spread – and seemingly, believed. This “ecosystem” of fabricated information presented as serious news continues to be a significant concern in discerning the credibility of news sources. But, almost as soon as the term “fake news” became part of our lexicon it was co-opted by Trump for his own ends, casting aspersions on the credibility of legitimate news organizations committed to ethical standards of journalism. Who could forget Trump, during a televised press conference refusing to take a question from a CNN reporter, telling him, “You are fake news.” Or, his many tweets labeling the New York Times’ carefully sourced journalism as “fake news.” He was at it again this week, tweeting Thursday about “FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ‘sources.’’’ Silverman is clear about how he defines fake news: “My definition of fake news has three criteria: it has to be 100-percent false – not a news article or partisan site that gets a few facts wrong; it has to be created consciously to be false; and there has to be an economic motive,” he said this week at an event at University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics. Silverman, now media editor of BuzzFeed News, is well aware that the term has been exploited by critics of legitimate news and will likely continue to be. “I think the term fake news has almost been rendered meaningless at this point,” he said. Indeed. I have yet to see any validity in any of the “fake news” charges lobbed our way. While it should go without saying, I think it’s safe to say, the Toronto Star is not in the business of fake news.

"On the walls of the  , two floors above the Toronto Star’s newsroom, hangs a painting that provides vivid evidence of this organization’s longtime commitment to credibility. It depicts a Norman Rockwell-like idealized view of the newsroom of the “Evening Star” in 1899, when the   was at the helm as publisher and proprietor. It shows about a dozen journalists – men in waistcoats, bowties and eyeshades – sitting at wooden tables, pencils in hand, with newspapers and books strewn about. A lone woman in a long dress, her hair in a topknot, walks among them carrying a stack of papers. On the wall hangs a poster adorned with gold stars and words that proclaim the mission of “A Paper for the People”: “Brightness, Accuracy, Enterprise.” I had an opportunity to see this piece of art only recently. Given my role for the past nine years as “guarantor of accuracy” on the many platforms on which the Star publishes these days, it delighted me so to see this image that paints a picture of the importance of accuracy all those 117 years ago, when Atkinson was building his newspaper. I thought about it this week on reading  . The central finding of this report, done by the U.S.-based  , was unsurprising: Accuracy is the single most critical reason why people trust a news organization. “Accuracy is the paramount principle of trust,” the study states. “Eighty-five per cent of Americans rate it as extremely or very important that news organizations get the facts right, higher than any other general principle.” The study also found that transparency (defined as the idea that news organizations explain the way they gather and report the news) is very important to building trust. So to is “balance,” defined as “reporting that provides different views.” Readers also highly value timeliness (that a news report provide you with the latest news and information), and clarity (that a report be concise and gets to the point.) Indeed, all of that does not sound a whole lot different from the imperative that the 1899 Evening Star provide brightness, accuracy and enterprise. This study does reveal information important to today’s media business facing a revenue squeeze as advertisers spend more with digital giants such as Facebook and Google: When readers trust a news organization they “engage” with it in ways that matter to the future of the news business. “Those news consumers especially concerned with trustworthiness are also the most likely to report that they take valuable actions — such as paying for news, spreading news to friends, and following the source on social platforms. “Trust is an important differentiator for building an audience.” While the report’s central thesis seems to me to be old news, there is much interesting research in the report about how audiences gauge the trustworthiness of news on new digital platforms, including websites, apps and social media. It tells us that the rise of social media, in particular, has contributed to public distrust in media. “When it comes to trust, many people who receive news from these social media platforms consume it with skepticism,” it says. “Social media news consumers do not generally trust the news they see there.” I have been following media credibility studies since 1985 when I was a reporter for the Star sent to API for a professional development seminar. On our agenda that week was a then brand-new research report done by the American Society of Newspaper Editors titled, “Newspaper Credibility: Building Reader Trust: A National Study.” I have never forgotten what I took away from that illuminating session: the reality that if journalists mess up such basics as spelling names correctly readers really do wonder what else we got wrong. A multitude of studies have since made clear that the media has a deepening credibility problem. This report again finds low levels of confidence in all media. As with many previous studies, it also points to a time-honored means of building trust: publishing corrections when we are wrong. “Several people said that owning up to mistakes and drawing attention to errors or mistakes can show consumers that a source is accountable and dedicated to getting it right in the long term,” it states. As “Kimberly,” one of the women interviewed for this report, stated, “We all make mistakes. If an outlet is wrong and is transparent about it and they screwed up, if they say I messed up and take ownership that makes me trust you more.” Indeed, trust matters. Always has, and always will.

"A reader’s good question about the Toronto Star’s reporting of the race of suspects wanted by police raised relevant points demanding further inquiry. “I am curious about the application of the Toronto Star’s policy on naming the race of suspects,” the reader, who works in the field of human rights law, told me last week. “The description of yesterday’s sexual assault suspect does not mention his race (he appears to be white), in contrast with an earlier story identifying a suspect as black. “Admittedly, I am more than curious – the ways in which race and suspects are reported can feed into stereotypes about race, propensity and crime,” said the woman, who preferred not to be named in this column. She is right of course. The media’s depiction of race can have a significant impact on the perception of race in our community. Particularly when it comes to depictions of race and crime. The Star has long decreed that “no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story.” Our   makes some exception in the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large. In such cases, the policy states, “there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose.” This reader pointed out two descriptions of suspects published recently in the Star. As she indicated, a Sept  made no reference to race in stating that, “The suspect, shown in a security camera picture, is described as about 25 to 35, 5-foot-9 to six feet tall, with medium build and brown hair. He was wearing a red gold shirt, navy blue shorts and brown thong sandals.” On   that did include the race of a suspect wanted in connection with a shooting in Christie Pits Park that left several people injured. “Police have released a photo of a suspect, who was participating in the fitness class, police say. He is described as a black man, 25 to 30-years-old, five-foot-eight to five-foot-nine with short cornrows that were visible from beneath his baseball cap.” The Star did not publish the full description of the man’s clothing, as provided by police, nor did it include the fact that police considered the suspect to be “armed and dangerous.”  The first article in the Star was accompanied by a photo of the suspect — clearly a white man. The second article did not include publication of the suspect photo released by police – likely because it was a blurry, poor quality image. As I told this reader, generally, the descriptions of suspects published in the Star come directly from police news releases. Still, I told her, there is a strong need for the Star to be consistent about how it reports these sensitive matters, regardless of what information police provide to reporters. The Toronto police force has its own policies on when it might include the race of suspects in its news releases. “Our policy is clear: where we have a picture in which a suspect’s face is clearly visible we will not attach a racial descriptor to it,” spokesman   told me. “We want to go with the best possible evidence and a good clear photo is always best. “If there is no clear picture, we will go with the description given to police by witnesses or victims,” Pugash said, adding that the security camera images of the suspect sought in the July 30 article did not provide a clear image of the suspect. In such cases when photos are not available or of poor quality, police news releases may well state that a suspect is white, black, brown or use other racialized descriptors that could aid in a member of the public identifying the suspect. Indeed in looking through the archive of police news releases, you can find all such descriptions. Like the Star, police policy calls for avoiding vague descriptions of suspects. “The information we put out has to enable someone to recognize someone,” Pugash said. Of course, much of this is subjective. What police regard as a full description may not rise to the level required by the Star. The Star’s newsroom must always be aware of our own policy and values in determining whether there is justification in reporting the race of suspects and not automatically include such information simply because police have put it in a news release. Certainly, as a news organization committed to equal dignity for all, the Star bears considerable responsibility to guard against reinforcing unfair racial stereotypes.

"The Toronto Star has been more than a newspaper for some time, having evolved in the past 20 years from providing news on paper to become a multi-platform digital news and information organization. The Star now publishes its content in the paper, on its website, thestar.com; on its new tablet app, Star Touch; and also on its mobile app. While not all content is always published on all these “platforms,” all content can potentially be published in any of these ways. That fact applies to articles written by staff and also to content submitted for publication by readers. Given this reality of multi-platform publishing, I was quite surprised to receive three requests in recent weeks from readers seeking to have their published letters to the editor removed from the Star’s website. One of the letters was published in 2010, another in 2011 and the third, last month. All expressed views on matters of public concern. Two of these readers contend that they did not know the letters they submitted for publication would not only be published in the Star’s print editions but also online. Now, they tell me, they do not want these letters — and their names — coming up in Google searches. One letter writer suggests that online publication of her letter violates her privacy rights. While hardly a week goes by that someone does not ask the Star to make information about them that was published previously on our website disappear from the Internet, these recent requests to delete letters to the editor are a new twist. The Star generally does not delete what it publishes online — what is known as “unpublishing.” Our policy is clear and firm: “The Star does not unpublish content from our websites or archives, except in some rare circumstances.” Those “rare circumstances” are generally legal reasons and always demand consultation with the Star’s editor, managing editor and newsroom lawyer. Unpublishing for rare reasons is indeed rare: In nearly nine years in this role, I can count on one hand the number of times when we have removed published information. Like most other news organizations, the Star’s unpublishing policy is rooted in the view that the website — our digital archive of what’s been published — is a matter of public record and that it is unethical to make content simply disappear because someone does not want to see an article in which they are named turn up in a Google search. It is worth knowing also that in this time when news and information is shared widely on social media, commented on, and cached on the web, it is virtually impossible to make words or images disappear entirely from the digital realm. Clearly the long lifespan and easy accessibility of digital news and information has created new issues for news organizations and sources. The Star has given this issue serious consideration. It does take steps to update online articles and correct any inaccuracies in a transparent way. If we report on people charged with crimes and those charges are later dropped or those named were acquitted, we will note the outcome of the charges in bold type at the top of the article, understanding that a report of a criminal charge is a grave concern to the person involved.  So what about these unusual requests to unpublish letters to the editor that were submitted – and signed — by readers eager to see their views expressed in the Star. Indeed, given that the Star publishes about 12 to 15 of more than 100 letters submitted each day, most readers see it as somewhat of a coup to have their letter selected for publication. I have spoken about this with the Star’s letters editor and the editorial page editor who is responsible for the Letters page. We all agree we cannot see any valid grounds for unpublishing published letters.  While these people seeking to have their letters taken down may well have since altered their views as expressed in those letters, or, as one of them told us, faced some professional repercussions for having expressed political views, I don’t think the Star can simply make those letters disappear as if they were never published. Nor can I accept the argument that those letters were submitted for publication in the newspaper and the Star did not make clear that they could be published online as well — or that this is some sort of privacy issue because explicit permission to publish online was not sought and given. Given that the Star has been publishing readers’ letters online for many years now and this news organization is publicly transparent that it publishes on many platforms, I cannot see the need to state this explicitly or obtain explicit approval. Indeed, we operate in a multi-platform digital age in which publishing has long since moved beyond printing words on paper. ",0,Publishing and ‘unpublishing’ in the digital age: Public Editor
"In the days before a badly written book about a guy named Grey became a global bestseller, I would often refer to the “shades of grey” in journalistic ethics. While one can’t go there these days without evoking smirks about the sexually explicit  , the fact remains that many aspects of journalistic ethics are not a black and white matter. And certainly the most intriguing and challenging ethical dilemmas of journalism often involve those many shades of grey. My job, indeed that of all journalists, would be so much easier if journalistic standards and ethics were always a clear-cut matter of “Thou shalt do this, Thou shalt not do that.” It is rarely that simple. The reality of the complexity of journalism ethics in our ever-evolving digital era is the guiding principle of an important new ethics initiative presented last week at the annual Online News Association conference held in Los Angeles and attended by more than 2,000 journalists from across North America. The “Build Your Own Ethics Code” project, led by veteran journalist Thomas Kent, standards editor of The Associated Press, involved more than 20 journalists working together for more than two years and soliciting input from many more journalists throughout North America. The initiative is rooted in the premise that beyond a few fundamental and unassailable principles, journalistic ethics cannot be cast in stone and that policy and practice can — and does — vary across news organizations and among individual journalists. That doesn’t mean anything goes. Or, that journalists should just make their own rules as they go along. After establishing four fixed points of journalistic values, the “BYO” ethics project provides a digital tool that guides journalists to customize their own codes of conduct based on a range of “building blocks” to consider in ethical decision-making. First, the important fixed points of journalistic ethics. These are non-negotiable – indeed “black and white” fundamentals of all journalism, the core of every one of the dozens and dozens of journalistic standards code I have looked at in recent years. These are:  Beyond those basics, the project encourages thought and discussion to determine where we stand as news organizations and as individual journalists on more than 40 specific issues including confidential sources, covering children and how we handle information gathered on social media. “We started with the recognition that the journalism profession encompasses ever more people, philosophies and technologies,” Kent says. “There are many definitions these days of a ‘journalist,’ making it more important than ever for journalists to be clear about who they are and what they stand for. “We believe the best hope for convincing all journalists to adopt and live by an ethics code is to give them ownership and flexibility in creating one.” Steve Buttry, a Louisiana State University journalism professor and a well-travelled newsroom journalism trainer who was involved in the project from the outset, says the BYO code recognizes that journalists are rarely unanimous in our views on ethics policies and practice. He sees great value in the debate and discussion this new tool enables. “As I’ve said many times, good ethical decisions don’t come from good rules but from many good conversations about ethics,” Buttry wrote in a recent blog post about the online ethics project. While this initiative is geared to journalists, I think it is instructive for our audiences as well. It is well worth checking out to learn more about the many shades of grey of journalism ethics.

"Writing recently about the unfairness of tax havens for the rich, freelance Op-Ed columnist  Linda McQuaig cited an estimated $8-billion annual revenue loss to Canadians from tax havens. McQuaig told you the number came from  . What she didn’t tell you is that she is a member of that group’s advisory board. Is that information that should be disclosed to readers? Is this a conflict of interest, as a reader who brought this to my attention suggested? I don’t see a conflict issue here. McQuaig is a monthly opinion columnist for the Star, not a reporter. As such, she has wide latitude to express views informed by her own extensive expertise, interests and involvements. Unlike news reporters who, according to the  , must be seen to be “fair-minded fact-finders” and should not be “both actors and critics” on public issues, columnists — especially freelancers — have more leeway for involvement in public issues. Still, there is a need for columnists and other Op-Ed writers to be transparent and make clear to readers any personal involvement in issues they write about. Certainly McQuaig’s longtime interest in economic justice is no secret.   she’s written nine books on politics and economics, including six national bestsellers. As her column credit note states, her most recent book, co-authored with Neil Brooks, is called  Nor, I am assured, was the writer attempting to hide her role with the tax fairness group. She simply overlooked mentioning her connection to the group that she is loosely affiliated with and in which she has no financial interest. And online the article linked to the organization’s website where McQuaig is listed as a member of the national advisory council. Still, Editorial Page Editor Andrew Phillips decided the column should include some acknowledgement of McQuaig’s involvement with the group. To that end, the credit note at the end of the column has been amended to make that fact clear. “Full disclosure is always best,” said Phillips, who like me does not regard this as a conflict issue. “If anything, adding a note here is an excess of caution.” I think that was the right call. As was a similar call Phillips made this week for fuller disclosure on an online Op-Ed article exploring the Toronto casino debate written by  , director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.  was critical of a University of Toronto, Martin Prosperity Institute study of the economic impact of a downtown casino in Toronto. Following a reader complaint that the article did not make clear Barrow’s past involvement with the casino industry, and upon further questioning of the author to determine the extent of any such involvement, the credit line on the article was amended to tell you: “He has conducted market feasibility studies for companies considering building casinos in New England.” Op-Ed writers are not meant to be unbiased bystanders. They write to express informed views rooted in their own expertise and experience. They express their own views, not those of the news organization.  It is up to you to assess the positions put forth in Op-Ed pieces. But to do so, you must be given any relevant information that might help you gauge the credentials and biases of those given space to provide their perspectives on newsworthy public issues. The Star can’t know all the affiliations of all Op-Ed writers and expects them to disclose any interests they have in a subject. “Op-ed writers aren’t supposed to be objective or to have no stake in the subjects they’re writing about,”  , said last fall in an interview with  , a media monitoring website.“When a writer does have a particular relationship to his subject that is not immediately apparent to the reader, it is important to disclose that so that the reader can evaluate the argument intelligently.”  after reporting that the Wall Street Journal had failed to disclose that 10 Op-Eds it published during the U.S. election campaign were written by advisers to presidential candidate Mitt Romney without any disclosure of that vital information. A former New York Times editor called such an egregious failure to disclose “shameless.”  , said: “Not disclosing is inexcusable. “We are pretty careful here to disclose any affiliation,” he added. Clearly, in this digital age of radical transparency, great care must be taken to assure the fullest disclosure possible.  ",0,Disclosure and conflict of interest in opinion columns: Public Editor
"“What’s fair” may well be journalism’s eternal question, long the subject of academic conferences, scholarly articles and noble journalistic navel-gazing. In the literature, “ ” is generally an abstract notion, difficult to define; it is considered “complex,” “illusive,” “paradoxical,” “subjective.” In the Star’s newsroom, what’s fair is neither abstract nor subjective. The core standard of fairness here is clear and concrete: any subject of potentially harmful factual allegations must be given opportunity to respond. As Bert Bruser, the Star’s lawyer, tells some journalist in the newsroom almost every day, getting the other side is “the essence of fairness” in line with the legal requirements of responsible journalism as they have evolved in recent decades. In last week’s column I told you about an   of accuracy and fairness that resulted in the Star publishing false allegations about MPP Margarett Best. Proper due diligence was not done here. While the reporter had attempted to reach Best, at no time did he state explicitly that he was working on a story that would report she was vacationing in Mexico while on medical leave from Queen’s Park. Had he done so, it’s quite likely he would have learned that was flat-out wrong and the Star would not have published the story. In light of this serious lapse, the newsroom is taking steps to ensure that everyone fully understand due diligence and fairness. In coming weeks, Bruser, along with  , will lead mandatory training sessions for all reporters. Donovan and his “I-team” are standard-bearers for the degree of due diligence fairness demands. Having talked extensively about this with him and Bruser, I expect many reporters have much to learn from them about the extent they must go to ensure they meet the standards of fairness laid down by the law and the Star’s policies. I-team exposés of wrongdoing most often put their subjects in a negative light. But it is standard operating procedure for I-team reporters to make certain those subjects are given every opportunity to respond to harmful allegations before publication, These reporters routinely make contact with the subjects of their investigations early in their reporting, often sending emails that lay out the explicit details of what they are looking into and what they hope to learn. “Everyone is entitled to give their side of the story. I preach that on a daily basis,” Donovan told me this week. “Telling a person or organization about an allegation gives them the opportunity at the start to tell you that you have it wrong, partly wrong, or mostly right. “Calling last minute doesn’t cut it. I often inform people or organizations on Day 1 of my investigation,” Donovan said. “People need to be told precisely what it is you are calling about. “It is the fair and responsible thing to do.” It is also the degree of diligence required to meet legal standards of fairness. Canada’s 2009 Supreme Court ruling on “ ” stipulates that “it is inherently unfair to publish defamatory allegations of fact without giving the target an opportunity to respond.” That’s a clear definition of fairness, but not really new. As Bruser reminded me, this standard was expressed forcefully in law some three decades ago when the Toronto Sun lost a libel suit brought by then cabinet minister John Munro after the Sun reported wrongly that Munro had been involved in illegal stock trading. Ontario Supreme Court Justice Mr. John Holland stated then that when “the paper has the goods on the person targeted in the story, it is basic and necessary that the person be confronted with the story so that his reaction be obtained.” Justice Holland aptly pointed out that getting the other side could indeed cause a story to be “discarded,” preventing publication of an incorrect story. Certainly that would have happened with the Best story. Through the years, Donovan, working closely with Bruser on many Star investigations, has come to understand the value of reaching out early to those he is investigating and being explicit about the allegations he is pursuing. Doing so makes for “a better, more responsible, more solid story,” Donovan said. In my books, that’s fairness in journalism. ",0,What’s fair is clearly defined at Star: Public Editor
"In journalism, the truth of images matters every bit as much as the truth of words. Just as fabrication is the cardinal sin of those who write the news, manipulating pictures is the zero-tolerance transgression of those who photograph the news. As a reader, you must know with all certainty that what you see published in the newspaper and online is indeed what the journalist’s camera saw. This core ethic of photojournalism has been the subject of much discussion in newsrooms around the globe this week after The Associated Press announced it “severed ties” with a Pulitzer Prize-winning freelance photographer who digitally altered an image he captured in Syria last year. As  , the AP said photographer Narciso Contreras told editors he manipulated a digital picture of a Syrian rebel fighter taken last September, using software to remove a colleague’s video camera from the lower left corner of the image. While the Star is an AP client and uses its photos daily, it did not publish this photo. Contreras was part of the   last year for powerful news images of the war in Syria. All of his photos have now been removed from AP’s publicly available archive. While some judge the news service’s reaction to be overly harsh, arguing that the photo altering did not alter the meaning of the image, it was a clear violation of the AP’s ethics code regarding the truth and accuracy of images. And while I imagine it wasn’t easy to reveal this ethical breach to the world, the AP’s transparency and accountability here is commendable — a model for media organizations on owning up to journalistic lapses. , the Star’s visuals editor, agreed totally with the AP’s call on this ethical transgression: “The Star would never do that to a news photo,” he told me. “The integrity of photos has to be there. If you cross that ethical line and alter what’s real in an image you lose credibility.”  holds our visual journalists (those who shoot still photos and video) to the same standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency as all other Star journalists. While the code says that digital manipulation is permissible to improve technical quality (colour, contrast and basic sharpening), it makes clear that “any alteration or enhancement that renders a photo inaccurate or misleading is forbidden.” While news photos in the Star “document reality,” sometimes feature stories are accompanied by “photo illustrations” that take creative liberties with images. The Star’s policy stipulates these must be labelled as such so readers clearly understand the image has been constructed. I have no doubt all of the Star’s staff photographers understand and hold true to this professional ethic. So too do the Star’s photo editors know that electronic manipulation of news photos is verboten. But, given that the Star and news organizations everywhere increasingly publish photos obtained from many outside sources, including social media, “citizen journalists” and “handout photos” from sources, there’s greater need to ensure the authenticity of photos before publishing them.  “There is always a chance that a submitted photo is not truthful. We must take steps to verify and ask ‘is this image real, is it truthful?’” Slawnych said, noting that today’s electronic tools make altering images easier than ever. So how do these standards square with the   published recently in the Star? As  , the Star’s real estate reporter, wrote last week, the “show-stopping photo” was taken with a wide-angle lens that appears to double the length of the home’s cobblestone driveway. The photographer hired by the real estate agent also acknowledged to Pigg that the photo is a “blending” of a few different exposures to capture the home in its best light. While such electronic manipulation is common practice in advertising and marketing, and also some magazines, it is not in line with the Star’s photo standards, Slawnych told me. Still, like Slawnych, I don’t have concerns of a significant lapse on the Star’s part here.  I think most readers will understand that handout MLS listing photos are advertising and marketing tools — not photojournalism — and what you see is rarely exactly what you get. As Pigg so aptly put it in her story about the photo controversy: “those glitzy real estate photos are meant to sell a dream, and a home.” But, given that this photo was published in the Star’s news pages to illustrate a story about the auction of the monster home, I am concerned that there was no photo credit included to indicate it was a handout marketing photo. While this was an unintended omission, readers needed that to clearly understand this glossy image was a realtor’s photo intended to enhance reality. For the Star, the reality is that both words and images must document truth, however unvarnished.  ",0,News photography documents unvarnished truths: Public Editor 
"By now, I would expect that all journalists invested in their future in journalism have let go of any silly notions that Twitter is merely a medium for sharing the trivial and the titillating. That attitude is so 2010. Back then, when I wrote about “the Twitter transformation,” I told you that some news veterans were disdainful of the then relatively new digital tool that allows real-time sharing of information in 140 characters or less. Certainly within the “twitterverse” you can still find the trivial (yes, some do still share what they ate for breakfast) and the titillating. And too much that is mean-spirited. But hasn’t that always been the case for any medium of communication? For journalists and news organizations, Twitter is now a vital tool, especially when news breaks. It allows journalists to tell you almost instantaneously what we learn, whether on the scene or by connecting directly to participants and witnesses. Yes, instant news does bring real risks of getting it wrong. I’ll get to that. But I do so believing Twitter is an important medium for journalism. What’s at issue is figuring out how to use it in a way that’s aligned with journalistic values of verification, accuracy and transparency.  These questions will be explored in Toronto next week in a “J-Talks” session, sponsored by the  . Headlining the panel is   and author of the recently released  . As the Star’s   writes in today’s World Weekly section, Carvin became known as “the man who tweets revolutions” when he tweeted thousands of daily, first-hand, live reports from citizens at the heart of the Arab Spring. The J-Talks session also features two other veteran journalists: digital pioneer  , senior media writer for GigaOM, and  , the recently appointed ombudsman for CBC English services. I am moderating the session. Entitled “The Twitter Effect: Is Journalism Still Able to Get it Right?” this panel came about in the aftermath of the   when much false information circulated within mainstream news websites and social media. Most egregious: many reported the wrong shooter, naming Ryan Lanza when it was actually his brother Adam. (Happily, due to the newsroom’s diligence, the Star did not report this erroneous information.) Then, as was the case in just about any major breaking news story in recent years, many journalists and news organizations gave readers false information in the rush to report at Twitter speed. Sometimes that wrong stuff was reported on Twitter first, other times by mainstream means first. In all cases, it was amplified in the echo chambers of Twitter. And each time, Twitter took the blame for the downfall of journalistic standards.  I think blaming this new medium is too simplistic.  Certainly journalists must figure out how to reconcile the conflict of reporting breaking stories in real time with the essential journalistic value of verification, which means  But, as the J-Talks panellists tell me, we need to do that within the reality that getting what happened down right when news breaks has always been somewhat messy. Even when journalists reported for a daily news cycle, we understood the truth of the now clichéd statement that “news is the best available version of the truth.” In the chaos of reporting breaking news on deadline, that meant we sometimes didn’t have everything right when it came time to publish. We updated in next-day stories and published corrections. Now that the news cycle never ends and Twitter can mean reporting on minute-to-minute deadlines, what should verification in journalism entail? Does it mean telling you only what we know with absolute certainty? Or can it mean being transparent with you about what we are unsure about but trying to verify? Do we need a more effective corrections process for real-time news? These are critical questions as journalism evolves and embraces new tools, particularly for legacy news organizations such as the Star where credibility matters much. Long-held standards of verification have served readers well here. Those standards boil down to a simple dictum, still well worth a tweet for thought: “When in doubt, don’t report.” ",0,Too simplistic to blame Twitter for journalistic lapses: Public Editor

"In journalism schools across Canada this week, many a freshman student will learn one of the foremost lessons of the J-school classroom: Get someone’s name wrong and you get a failing grade. In the decade I taught at   my students understood that no matter how brilliant their reporting and writing, if they messed up a name, they got an automatic F on that assignment. That’s a common policy of most journalism schools. In the Star’s newsroom, we don’t hand out failing grades for misspelled, mixed-up names. But we do publish corrections. If the Star gets a given or surname wrong, whether in the newspaper or online, we always correct. That is a fundamental undertaking of the Star’s corrections practice.  Getting names right has long been considered “the bedrock measure of accuracy” in journalism. Correcting when we make mistakes matters greatly both to those whose names we get wrong and to readers. Every media credibility study I’ve looked at indicates that readers link credibility with basic accuracy and believe that getting names right is a significant indication of the overall accuracy of the journalist and the news organization. We well know it’s a fact that if we get your name wrong you’ll wonder what else we got wrong. That’s why double-checking names must be the most basic of fact-checking for journalists. But even the most careful journalists can make mistakes with names. Of 198 corrections published in the Star in the first half of this year, 58 were for wrong names. That’s 29 per cent of all corrections and tracking upward from last year when 100 of 415 newspaper corrections (just under 25 per cent) were for incorrect names. We also made 316 online-only corrections in those six months, a great many for incorrect names. I can’t imagine anyone here would disagree that’s too many incorrect names making it into the Star. Clearly, the Star could enhance its accuracy record considerably by making even more concerted efforts across the newsroom to ensure all first and last names are stated and spelled correctly. I can assure you no journalist sets out to mangle someone’s name. A recent Canadian research study, “ ” found that the newspaper journalists interviewed about their methods of verifying information before publication all reported that they always took steps to ensure their subjects’ names were correct. “An almost universal practice among participants is asking sources to spell their own name to ensure correct spelling, either at the beginning or the end of the interview,” stated the study published in February’s  As the study states, these journalists said they regarded an mistake in someone’s name as “a very visible error that can have implications for professional credibility.” The Star’s error-tracking data leads me to two conclusions about how and why journalists get names wrong: Some do indeed fail in the basic requirement to verify the name and its spelling with the source. More often, they make mistakes when inputting names to their computers — your basic “typo” that’s subsequently not caught in their self-editing and the overall newsroom editing process. Most mistakes in the Star start with writers. Our error data indicates that of the 198 corrections overall from January through June, 139 errors are classified as writing errors by reporters (100), columnists (19), freelance writers (16), editorial writers (2) and letter writers (2). With newsroom restructuring resulting in fewer copy editors in the newsroom (and indeed in every newsroom throughout North America) there’s a strong case to be made that every writer must learn techniques to become their own best editor. In coming weeks, I’ll be working with the newsroom to put together training sessions to help writers better catch their own errors and ensure that all writers have access to  . Such checklists have been proven to make a considerable difference in minimizing errors in names and other such basic facts. Simply reading our work back to ourselves doesn’t work in catching many errors — especially typos — because as Joseph T. Hallinan writes in  , “By and large, we see what we expect to see.”  Whatever steps the newsroom and individual journalists take to minimize mistakes, some errors are inevitable given journalism’s deadline driven realities. That’s why I make this pledge to you: If the Star gets your name wrong, we will publish a correction. ",0,"If Star misspells your name, we will correct: Public Editor"
"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced Canada’s first gender-parity cabinet and declared it a no-brainer — “Because it’s 2015” — women across the country understandably hoped it was the beginning of a new era. But it’s taken three long years for even this feminist-leaning government to get around to introducing  aimed at closing the stubborn wage gap between men and women. Women in Canada continue to earn 31 per cent less than men annually, a gap that has remained despite human rights laws and decades of efforts to eliminate it. As a result, women on average would have to work until they’re 79 years old to retire with the same earnings men accumulate by 65.  Part of that wage gap persists because women are still concentrated in lower-paying sectors, forced to accept part-time hours when they want full-time work, less likely to be promoted to senior positions, take time off to have children, and still bear the brunt of the responsibility for raising them. And some of the gap comes from persistent discrimination against “women’s work,” which results in women being paid less for work of equal value.  That’s the gap the new legislation aims to tackle.  It requires federally regulated employers to identify job classes, evaluate work, compare compensation associated with jobs dominated by men and women respectively and examine their compensation practices to ensure women and men in the workplaces receive equal pay for work of equal value. The legislation applies to federal public servants and political staff, as well as federally regulated sectors such as banking, shipping and telecommunications. That means it will only cover 1.2 million people, about 6 per cent of the workforce.  In its last budget, the government estimated pay equity could close the gender wage gap, based on full-time hourly wages, from 91.4 cents to 94.1 cents for federal employees and from 88.1 cents to 90.7 cents in the regulated private sector. That’s not all that’s needed but at least it’s moving the bar in the right direction. But even those improvements won’t come quickly. The government is giving affected employers three years to establish pay-equity plans   the legislation comes into force — which won’t be for a year after it receives Royal Assent. Even then, employers will have more years to actually close the identified gaps.  The Liberals promised pay equity years ago and renewed that promise in their last budget. But the timeline they rolled out with this week’s legislation means it won’t make a difference in women’s lives until well after the next election. There’s no need for such a go-slow approach since this isn’t a groundbreaking idea. Ontario introduced similar pay equity legislation as far back as  . Thirty years under pay equity hasn’t eliminated the wage gap for women in Ontario, so the Trudeau government is being careful not to oversell the effect its legislation will have. The truth is pay equity isn’t a panacea for ending the wage gap; much more still needs to be done. The impact the wage gap has on the economy — and in turn on government coffers from lost taxes — is huge and Ottawa has long known that. As far back as 2005, the Royal Bank estimated that if Canadian women had the same labour market opportunities as men, personal incomes would be $168 billion higher each year. Closing the gap and encouraging the full participation of women in the workforce requires a multifaceted approach. The priority should be introducing a national child-care plan similar to the one Quebec introduced decades ago. Studies around the world, including those from government panels and royal commissions in Canada, show that accessible, affordable child care is the No. 1 way to shrink the wage gap, not to mention get women back into the workforce, boost family incomes, improve early childhood skills for poor kids, and reduce child poverty. Pay transparency, which the Trudeau government touched on in its last budget, helps, too. When the was forced to publish the pay bands of its highest earners in the summer of 2017, for example, it showed that high-profile women were earning far less than men doing the same jobs.  That’s why the Ontario government’s   to delay — and possibly change — pay transparency legislation, which was supposed to come into effect in January, is a step in the wrong direction. The legislation was passed under the previous Liberal government, and would require employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings and track wages by gender and diversity. But instead of seeing that as a boon for women and the economy, the Ford government sees it as a “challenge” for businesses. That’s backward thinking.  Governments have long known that closing the wage gap benefits women, families and the economy as a whole. Trudeau’s self-described feminist government, of all governments, should be doing more to close it. They should have taken steps in that direction because it’s 2015. But 2018 is not too late.

"Do you have a clear understanding of what is news and what is opinion in the Star? Perhaps this distinction is not totally evident to you. Based on many  , it is clear to me that one of the key sources of misunderstanding about the Star and its journalism is a considerable measure of confusion about how to distinguish between news and opinion. As a Star reader you have a right to know if what you are reading in the Star is news – verified information based in the impartial reporting of facts – or opinion – a column or editorial based on the personal interpretation and judgments of facts. The   has long expressed this core value, stating that, “Sound practice demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion. “All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate.” While the Star has long strived to make this distinction clear in the newspaper through the use of various design elements (such as a columnist’s “logo”) intended to denote a piece of opinion journalism, my communications with readers over the past decade tell me these devices are often inadequate for those who don’t understand our design shorthand. Further muddying these waters is the fact that “opinion” logos, which include a journalist’s photo, are sometimes used on news stories too. How is a reader supposed to distinguish news from opinion? Discerning news from opinion within the Star’s digital world — on the website, mobile apps and social media postings – is even more of a challenge for readers. Here the Star too often falls short of its own principle. Many days, opinion columns expressing strong views about controversial issues are presented in a similar manner as news stories, within news sections of those digital platforms, with no signposts to indicate that what you are reading is not the news but in fact someone’s opinion about the news. The clearest way to tell readers that an article represents a writer’s views is to label it as opinion. The Star is now taking steps to do a better job of this on all its platforms.  The  , launched in May to look into how the Star can foster greater reader trust and develop journalistic and technological tools to bridge the trust and media literacy gap, identified the need to differentiate news from opinion as a priority issue. This group spent much of the summer looking at how to more clearly and consistently signal to readers on all platforms — including the Star’s social media feeds — when articles are analysis or opinion. I expect the Star will soon move forward on recommendations to provide stronger signposts to readers about whether they are reading news, analysis or opinion and also give readers clarity about the definitions of various sorts of content.  This is vital at this time of diminishing trust in journalism when the sheer volume of opinions and conjecture about the news can overwhelm the real reporting of verified information. Indeed, as news organizations around the world grapple with a crisis of trust in journalism, the need to guide audiences to a clear understanding of how to distinguish news from opinion has emerged as a significant indicator of journalistic trust. Several ongoing global trust projects have fixed on the need to do a better job of this. “One of the most common themes from users is that they are tired of blurred lines between fact and opinion,”   wrote recently in an article reporting on the project’s research into reader feedback on the credibility and trustworthiness of news. The   has identified the need for labels on content to identify news from opinion as a trust indicator. That project aims to create tools for readers to recognize trustworthy reporting and for platforms such as Google to identify and feature high quality journalism. A working group of the California-based project has set out clear definitions for various types of content and recommends that news organizations be transparent in sharing those definitions with readers. Both its definitions and recommendation for transparency are aligned with the recommendations of the Star’s trust committee. That group defines news as articles, “based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources…News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author.” Opinion articles “advocate for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author/producer’s interpretation of fact and data. Opinion pieces may include reported facts or quotes, but emphasize the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions,” it states. My opinion: these are smart recommendations critical for enhancing trust in journalism.  ",0,Readers need to distinguish news from opinion: Public Editor

"Among the more comical mistakes published in the  recently was a typo that transposed two letters in a word to turn the “marital bed” into the “martial bed.” Many readers wondered if there was some sort of Freudian slip in misspelling “marital” as “martial” in the first paragraph of a Jan 18 article about the perils of adultery in the marriage bed. “The bed they practised their martial arts in? Bed for a court martial? I can't believe an editor let THAT one slip by!” commented W.J.R. Halyn. Why do journalists make such silly mistakes? How indeed does an error that jumps out at readers slip through the  ’s editing process?  In search of greater insight and understanding into these persistent reader questions, I turned to two recently published books that delve deeply into the psychology and philosophy of our innate fallibility:  , by  , a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, and  , by  , also an award-winning journalist. Though neither of these journalists writes specifically about media errors, their compelling insights into the nature of human error help explain how mistakes are made and why being wrong is inevitable in any endeavour in which mere mortals are involved. Journalists are well aware that typos, grammar gaffes, misspellings and inaccuracies mar a news organization’s credibility and annoy its readers. I know that most writers take great care to double-check their work and editors aim to catch errors before they are published.  But, who among us — journalist or reader — has not had the experience of checking our work and missing our mistakes? Hallinan, a former writer for the   tells us this is the human condition. His cites research indicating that even the most careful readers do not read every single letter, in every single word, in every single sentence.  That reality helps explains an error in his former newspaper that referred to a competition of British jesters who would be riding on unicorns. In fact, as the  ’s subsequent correction noted, the clowns were to ride unicycles.  “For anyone interested in mistakes, the corrections columns of newspapers often make delicious reading,” he notes. Unicorn, unicycle, marital, martial. All too often, it is all the same to the human eye.  “It’s tempting to attribute mistakes like this to simple carelessness,” Hallinan writes. The reality is more complex however. Most people skim and miss some details.  And, he adds, “the more skilled we are, the more likely we are to skim.” That explains why even highly skilled editors miss mistakes.  “We see only what we expect to see,” Hallinan says. “Overlooked mistakes are so common that researchers have given them their own designation: they are called ‘proofreader’s errors’ “These humdrum errors reveal some interesting quirks about the way human perception works. Perception, above all, is economical. We notice some things and not others.” As well, as something becomes more familiar we tend to notice less, not more and “we come to see things not as they are but as (we assume) they ought to be. “We are blinded by the effects of habit and hubris and hobbled by a poor understanding of our own limitations. We don’t see all that we observe, and yet we sometimes ‘see’ things we don’t know we’ve seen.” Schulz expresses a similar idea about how we look but do not see in  , an engaging philosophical examination of the inevitability of human error. “To be blind without realizing our blindness is, figuratively the situation all of us are in when we are in error,” she writes. If this is so, should we simply give up and accept the inevitability of what readers perceive to be journalistic carelessness?  Of course not. While typos rooted in human error may indeed be somewhat inevitable in any publication, we can aim to minimize them. Both of these writers contend we must understand our innate fallibility to devise better methods to see clearly and catch our mistakes. “It helps to second-guess, to play devil’s advocate with yourself,” Hallinan writes. “We all think we are above average. In this conceit lies the seeds of many mistakes.” Hallinan points to professions such a pilots and anesthesiologists that have minimized life-threatening “human error” by devising checklists that acknowledge the possibility of mistakes and enhance awareness of what can go wrong. Similar measures in newsrooms include accuracy checklists and production systems that assure all copy is read over by fresh eyes before publication. The reality is that such measures are often skipped in the rush to deadline and mistakes make it into print. To minimize human error, Schulz suggests we need to be humble and know that what can go wrong often will go wrong: “If we want to try to eradicate error, we have to start by assuming that it is inevitable.” Indeed, mistakes happen.

"The news from the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, headlined in the top spot of the breaking news lineup on thestar.com’s home page Tuesday morning, declared: “Town council votes itself 43 per cent raise.” Almost immediately, online commenters began to weigh in on news about the controversial pay hike debated for months throughout the town: “They have got to be kidding, a 43% raise,” said one. Echoed another, “What were they thinking, taking 43%.” Not long after, reporter Kate Allen, who had filed this news to the web in haste, realized she had erred and misunderstood the actual numbers councillors had voted on. In fact, it was an 18.6 per cent raise for councillors and 16 per cent for the mayor. Allen informed her editor, Dave Beer, and the online story was changed. So too was the “updated” home page headline, which now told a different story altogether: “Whitchurch-Stouffville councillors back down on massive pay raise.” If incorrect information is published online and subsequently changed, did a mistake actually occur? Should readers be told what was initially wrong? Or, in the digital news universe, do updates replace corrections? Reader Val Dodge, who read the two online versions of the  ’s report — and sent me screen shots of both — told me he was “disturbed” the   had not acknowledged the original error. “I think it is incumbent upon the   to openly acknowledge online errors, especially ones as egregious as this one,” Dodge said. “It may be acceptable to silently fix a misspelled word or misplaced punctuation, but silently changing a headline so that it means the exact opposite of its original wording is far beyond what I would consider acceptable.” This reader is correct. What happened here was not acceptable. The  ’s accuracy and corrections policy applies to all content on all platforms. It says that errors, in print or online, must be corrected clearly, promptly and prominently. It also states, “Building trust in the digital world demands that the   is seen to be transparent.” In this case, readers needed to be clearly informed in an online correction that the first report was wrong. As David Cash, CAO and town manager of Whitchurch-Stouffville, said in an email: “The town is very concerned about this error as it immediately generated a number of comments on the website that left people with incorrect information, which further perpetuated the error.” I knew nothing of this until I received Dodge’s email. The original story had been changed in the newsroom and the public editor’s office was not informed — as we should have been. For almost 40 years now, since the creation of its “Bureau of Accuracy” the  ’s public editor (long titled the ombudsman) has had responsibility for determining and publishing daily corrections. Like much else that is necessarily changing as newspapers evolve to become fully digital, the  ’s centralized print-centric corrections process must also evolve to reflect the reality of 24/7 publishing in which every journalist in the newsroom can easily amend/fix/update/correct/publish online content. Digital content is published, updated and amended (necessarily) around the clock. That means everyone in the newsroom must take responsibility for ensuring that the  is as vigorous about correcting and acknowledging online errors as we have long been in print.   Editor Michael Cooke sent a note to the newsroom this week to make this clear to all.  In recent months, I’ve grown increasingly concerned about the  ’s level of transparency about online errors, having come across far too many examples of the newsroom “fixing” stories without acknowledging mistakes. I know no one likes making mistakes. And certainly, some journalists are reluctant to own up to errors. But we owe it to our readers to be clear about what we’ve corrected online, lest we create confusion about what is accurate. Not all journalists agree. Some contend that mistakes online are rectified when a story is republished with corrected information. They suggest that the very ease of online publishing means there is little more need for actual corrections that tell readers what was first wrong. That’s not the view of reputable news organizations that understand the vital importance of credibility. I’ve spent considerable time learning about online corrections policies of various newsrooms around the world including the  , the  , the  ,  , NPR and the BBC.  The   strives to correct and acknowledge online errors regardless of how little time the inaccurate information was online. “The policy is to correct and be transparent about what was corrected when an error is made regardless of whether it’s been online for five seconds, five minutes or five hours,” public editor Arthur Brisbane told an ombudsman conference last spring. All the organizations I consulted share the conviction that transparency demands we should not “scrub” digital content, that is, just fix it and hope no one notices.  Because, of course, someone always notices. ",0,Public editor: Online corrections essential for credibility
"“How did Céline Dion’s backyard merit a front-page photo,” reader Michelle Guilmette asked this week. “Is there nothing else newsworthy out there?” The day before, reader Bill Archibald emailed to inquire why the  had devoted time and space to the story of Ludwig the cat who went missing at Pearson airport. Why, he asked, is a lost cat news? In any given week, readers of the   are apt to ask some variation of the essential questions at the heart of those emails: What is news? Who decides what the   pays attention to — and what it ignores. What runs on Page 1 and on the home page of thestar.com? Readers are quick to weigh in on what the   covers as well as what it doesn’t cover. I often hear from those of you who are disappointed that the  did not cover an event in which you have a particular interest. For example, this week a reader wondered why he could not find news about the   anniversary celebrations in the  . Another longtime reader, a 70-year-old man who told me he was sexually abused in his childhood, wrote an impassioned letter imploring the  to provide more coverage of the serious questions raised in the final report (released last December) of Ontario’s public inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Cornwall. The   defines news as “information about important or interesting recent events.” There’s broad scope in that for judgment about what is “important” — information you need to know — and what is “interesting” — stuff you might want to know. Deciding what’s news is the core work of the media. As the renowned journalist and media critic   once said: “All the reporters in the world, working all the hours of the day, could not witness all the happenings in the world.” Journalism is, by necessity, the art of selection, of deciding what matters and how to present that to audiences. While the Internet and the emergence of “citizen journalism” and social media have made it easier to connect and communicate within our global village, leading some to argue that journalism’s role as a “gatekeeper” is not necessary, there’s a case to be made that the barrage of accessible information makes the editor’s job of selection more vital. The  ’s senior editors strive to provide a mix of what they believe readers need to know and what you might want to know. Clearly, on any given day, their news judgment won’t be in accord with that of all readers — or even all   journalists. “Why is that news?” is a sentiment as apt to be expressed in the newsroom as in the public editor’s email box. Indeed, such was the case with Thursday’s Page 1 play of Céline Dion’s $20 million new estate. For my part, I’m with reader Keung Lui who wrote: “I am happy for Céline and her 8-year-old son that they could afford a $20 million play house. But is this so-called news worth the front page of the  ? Don’t you have some real and more important news to report?” How do journalists decide what is news? Is news simply determined by an editor’s whim, as expressed by the oft-cited cliché of the powerful editor who declares, “News is what I say it is.” Textbook definitions of news that aim to teach aspiring journalists how to develop “news judgment” are of little practical use in the daily, and increasingly online, hourly, fray of deciding what’s news. For example, few editors ever consciously consider what one text tells us: “News is information about a break from the normal flow of events, an interruption in the unexpected” (practical translation: Dog bites man: not news. Man bites dog: news). , the famous editor of the now-defunct     defined news as the three W’s — “women, wampum and wrongdoing” (practical translation: sex, money and crime). That’s sexist, to be sure. How far off is it, though? Consider how those universal elements figure in many important and interesting news stories. Journalism textbooks define the factors of newsworthiness as the impact of information on citizens, whether conflict and controversy are involved, timeliness, the prominence of those involved and proximity to the audience. Novelty and oddity also factor in. Many successful editors, striving to appeal to readers, have long defined news as that which makes a reader say, “Gee whiz!” For most journalists, deciding what’s news is instinctive, rooted in experience and their perceptions of what readers want. Practical factors such as space, reporting resources, the mix of hard news and softer features, the number of events competing for attention, as well as the availability of compelling photos to illustrate the news, are also at play. All these theories aside, there is one overriding consideration that helps explain the daily puzzle of what is news: What’s newsworthy on a “slow news day” is far different than what you’ll read when a natural disaster happens or a parliamentary scandal breaks. It’s a safe bet that Céline Dion’s water-park would not have made such a splash on the day a tsunami struck or there was a tidal wave of earth-shaking news. ",0,English: Who decides what’s news

"olumnists occupy a privileged perch in journalism, having the freedom to express their opinions on issues that matter to them. The considerable distinction between news reporting and columnists' opinions in the  is often not clear to readers, however. That's sometimes because the   doesn't clearly indicate when an article is an opinion column. But there's also much misunderstanding about the scope of   columnists. Simply put, news is the unbiased, fair reporting of facts, gathered and verified by reporters. Columns are expressions of opinions about facts. Among the most frequent subjects of complaint to the public editor's office is that some columnist or another at the   is ""biased,"" ""unobjective"" or ""unfair."" The reality is that opinion columnists can indeed be biased, unobjective and yes, sometimes, unfair.  That's the nature of opinion journalism. Opinion columns are a columnist's arguments for a particular point of view. And vigorous argument is not necessarily fair and balanced, as you should expect the news to be.  As Clark Hoyt, public editor of  , told me in an email discussion about whether public editors should weigh in on the fairness of opinion columns: ""I think it is virtually impossible to judge the `fairness' of arguments made by a newspaper or those it licenses to offer their own opinions.  ""Argument is almost by definition unfair, in the sense that one marshalls facts to support a conclusion, emphasizing some and de-emphasizing or ignoring others. Someone who disagrees with the conclusion almost always thinks that has been done unfairly.""  Columnists at the   have wide latitude in articulating their opinions and the manner in which they express their views – however outrageous those views may seem to some. If I had a loonie for every time a reader told me he or she considered an opinion column in the   to be ""unfair"" or ""offensive,"" I could escape dreary November and be sunning on the Mediterranean right now. Instead, I'm in Montreal today, attending the annual conference of the Canadian Media Lawyers Association, also called Ad IDEM – Advocates in Defence of Expression in the Media. I tell you this because the core mission of this organization – standing up for the Charter right of freedom of expression given to all Canadians – is at the heart of a newspaper columnist's right to express opinions that some may find offensive. As Justice Ian Binnie said in last year's Supreme Court ruling on fair comment: ""We live in a free country where people have as much right to express outrageous and ridiculous opinions as moderate ones. ... Public controversy can be a rough trade and the law needs to accommodate its requirements.""    columnists are guided by these legal freedoms, which include the obligation that opinions expressed in columns be based on fact. Like all journalists, opinion columnists must also abide by laws regarding libel and hate speech.  Columnists speak for themselves, not the newspaper (the views of the   are expressed on the editorial page). That doesn't mean ""anything goes.""  The  s columnists are subject to editorial oversight and this news organization's ethical standards. It's not unusual for columnists to alter what they have to say, or the manner in which they say it, at the behest of astute editors offering wise second thought.  Still, I'm often asked: ""Why did the editor let  in the paper?""  My answer: Generally, editors give columnists wide latitude in expressing their personal opinions in recognition both of the right to freedom of expression and journalistic traditions of what makes for a compelling column. As  , a collection of newspaper columns, tells us, columnizing is a ""self-indulgent"" occupation, and columnists have licence to be ""rude, reckless, silly and prejudiced."" That same view was expressed by the recently deceased William Safire in a note to the   A.M. Rosenthal when Rosenthal became a columnist: ""As you cultivate the garden of controversy, burn the bridges of objectivity. Show me an even-handed columnist and I'll show you an odds-on favourite soporific.""  It's the right and the role – arguably, even the responsibility – of columnists to poke and provoke, enrage and offend. In doing so, the best columnists can make us think and reach our own conclusions about issues that matter to us. Readers often ask me to weigh in on the ""fairness"" of opinion columns. I don't think it's fair to offer my opinion on a columnist's opinion. I do tell these readers that they have the right to express dissenting opinions through letters to the editor or online comments.  Certainly, I don't always agree with the opinions published in the  .  But, as a defender of the right to free expression, I must defend the right to offend.

"Canadians are tough enough and confident enough in our own values to listen to the likes of Steve Bannon. We need not fear that our intellectual integrity or our social fabric are so fragile as to be threatened by having him voice his views on our soil. For that reason, if for no other, there’s no good reason to cancel  , where Bannon will face off against conservative commentator David Frum on the issue of populism. Organizers of the debate have been under pressure to scrap the event, on the grounds that giving Bannon a podium will give him an opportunity to spread his views on why economic nationalism and right-wing populism are on the rise around the world. Bannon is, after all, a former senior counsellor to Donald Trump. He was a key architect of Trump’s rise to the White House and a theorist of the new populism, which is on the march from Europe to the Philippines to (most recently) Brazil. More darkly, he’s accused of being a straight-out white nationalist — something he himself denies. So it’s no surprise in these nervous times that various groups have called on debate organizers to cancel. Their argument is that Bannon’s views are so noxious that they should not be “normalized” by a respectable organization. The Ontario and federal New Democrats have joined that call, although NDP MP Nathan Cullen rather undermined his own argument by saying he trusts that Canadians will reject Bannonism. On that point he’s quite right. There’s no debate that Bannon’s views are antithetical to those of most Canadians, and simply retrograde on their face. We’ve spoken out countless times against the destructive economic nationalism of the Trump administration, the faux populism that goes along with it, and the divisive rhetoric that has done so much to create a climate in which hate can take root. All this can be laid at the feet of Bannon. But is banning Bannon the right thing to do? In deciding that, it’s important to be clear on what’s involved. To begin with, this is not, strictly speaking, an issue of free speech as such. No one is seriously suggesting that the government forbid Bannon from entering the country, or that authorities should intervene to prevent the debate from going ahead. The Munk Debates are free to invite him and Bannon is free to speak; likewise, those who oppose him are free to denounce his views and demonstrate against his presence. Free speech does not mean speech without consequences or push-back. Nor does free speech imply a right to an audience. It was clearly a choice by the Munk organizers to invite Bannon, and one can question the wisdom of that. Is this the best way to encourage debate on populism at this time? They could not help but know that Bannon is a lightning rod, and the decision to feature him can only be seen as a kind of intellectual clickbait, a way of courting attention for what is generally a tame exchange staged for the benefit of an audience well-heeled enough to pony up $200 a ticket. In that, at least, they have obviously succeeded. But now that Bannon has been invited, disinviting him would be both wrong and counter-productive.  It would be wrong because we need to hear directly from people like Bannon in a context where their views can be subjected to rigorous examination. He isn’t coming to be honoured or celebrated. He’s coming to be challenged, and that should be welcomed, not feared. The Economist magazine faced criticism very similar to that being directed at the Munk organizers when it included Bannon in a recent forum. Its editor, Zanny Minton Beddoes,  : “The future of open societies will not be secured by like-minded people speaking to each other in an echo chamber, but by subjecting ideas and individuals from all sides to rigorous questioning and debate.” That puts it well. It would also be wrong to exclude Bannon for the very reason that, like it or not, his way of thinking is becoming more influential. Attempting to quarantine him intellectually, or lump him in with discredited racist fringe elements like the KKK, is pointless. We have to understand the rise of the new populism, if only to better combat it. Why not hear from one of its principal exponents? At the same time, attempting to “deplatform” Bannon would only play out in his favour. For one thing, it’s clearly impossible to deny anyone a way to spread his ideas in the age of the internet. For another, it would simply reinforce the populist narrative that supposed intellectual “outsiders” like Bannon are being excluded and silenced by “elites” who refuse even to hear them out. Far better to deny Bannon the satisfaction of being able to claim he’s being “censored” by a bunch of Canadians too nervous or too fearful to let him speak. Far better to encourage the widest possible exchange of ideas, all the while making sure we expose bad and dangerous ideas for what they are. Protecting free speech comes with a responsibility to counter its abuses. Above all, let’s have the confidence to believe in ourselves and our values. They are certainly strong enough to withstand a visit from Steve Bannon. ",0,Steve Bannon is no threat to Canadian values
"Is the Trudeau government short-changing democratic rights for partisan advantage? That certainly appears to be the case after  — where it just so happens NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for a seat in the House of Commons. Indeed, no other explanation stands up to scrutiny.  After all, can the Liberals really expect Canadians to believe they are holding off on the byelection out of respect for voters in the riding who also have to mail in their vote on B.C.’s electoral reform referendum by Nov. 30? If that were the case, Trudeau could have called the Burnaby South byelection for Dec. 3, the date he set for the Ontario riding of Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes on Sunday.  Yes, Singh could have run in other byelections during his first year as leader, as the Liberals point out. But he has a right to choose one he thinks is winnable, just as other leaders from other parties have done before him.  And, of course, the prime minister has the right to wait 180 days after a vacancy occurs to call a byelection, which gives him until mid-March to set a date for this one. But just because he can, doesn’t mean he should.  In this case, he should not wait. For while the Liberals stand to gain by delaying the byelection for as long as possible — they keep Singh out of the political spotlight if he wins and make it more difficult for the NDP to replace him before next fall’s election if he doesn’t — voters have much to lose.  First, 112,000 people in Burnaby South currently have no representative in Ottawa. That should be rectified sooner rather than later. Second, voters across the country are best served by having all opposition leaders in the Commons doing their job of holding the government’s feet to the fire. Trudeau should stop gaming the system and call the vote in Burnaby South as quickly as possible. That may not be best for his party, but it would be good for democracy.

"Duz acurit spelling mattur 2 U? In this digital age of texting, tweeting and time-stressed journalism, has proper spelling gone the way of hot type? As language evolves, should spelling too? Should the language of texting become common parlance? Are u ok with “1” for “won,” “L8r” for “later,” “UR” instead of “you’re”? A heart for “love?” In a provocative essay published in this month’s   magazine, entitled   writer and professor   argues against the “outdated dogma” of standardized spelling. She contends it’s time to “loosen our idea of correct spelling.” Language evolves, she said, “and spelling evolves, too, as we create new words, styles and guidelines. “Consistent spelling was a great way to ensure clarity in the print era,” she said. “But with new technologies, the way that we write and read (and search and data-mine) is changing, and so must spelling.” While Trubek presents a compelling argument for the “terrible mess” of the English language and its many inconsistencies in spellings, and tells us that the notion of consistent spelling is a “fairly recent invention” (albeit, an invention dating back at least to the 1770s), I can’t imagine the conventions of proper spelling disappearing from journalism any time soon. Certainly, spelling does matter at the  . Our readers remind us constantly that spelling matters. Misspellings and typos in the newspaper and online can provoke more passionate reader indignation than just about any other journalistic transgression. Sometimes disproportionately so. “You subject your readers to multiple spelling mistakes,” a reader recently told me in an email criticizing the   for misspelling “anesthesiologist.” “Your newspaper is supposed to be a model, not a source of mistakes which are careless and avoidable,” he wrote. “Journalism is not only about what you write but how you present it to the reader. “This is totally unacceptable for any type of publication, spell checker or no spell checker.” This week, a reader who identified himself as “a retired professor living in Portugal” emailed me about a  sports blog in which the possessive “its” was misspelled as the contraction “it’s” three out of four times in the piece. Another reader wrote this week to point out that a reporter wrote “sighting” when she meant “citing.” In recent weeks, readers have pointed out that the   wrote about a movie “premier” instead of a “premiere” and referred to the “forward” of a book instead of the “foreword.” Clearly homonyms — those words that sound the same, but have different meanings and spellings — are a challenge. To sometimes hilarious effect (not affect!), the   has confused stationary and stationery, fazed and phased, principal and principle, aide and aid, pored and poured. These commonly misspelled words always need double-checking. Is this just niggling nitpicking? Trubek believes the reason we have rules or rather, “arbitrary contrivances” governing spelling is simply “snobbery.” She argues that new technologies, such as smart phones and tablets, are “speeding the adoption of more casual forms of communication.” But certainly people expect more from journalists than the casual newspeak of texts and 140-character tweets. As my son, 19, chided me in a message he texted in response to my hastily typed, error-ridden text message: “Nice grammar. I thought U were an editor.” Media credibility studies consistently tell us that spelling errors erode journalism’s credibility. We know public trust depends on journalists getting the details right. I don’t see how any journalist can buy into Trubek’s argument that correct spelling no longer matters. As   of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies aptly concluded in an online report about Trubek’s essay, “journalists value accuracy.” “We want to get our facts straight and spell words right — not just to avoid corrections but to offer as much clarity as possible to the reader,” she wrote.” Once you start using misspelled words — even if they’re commonly accepted in the world of text messages and instant messages — you lose a segment of your audience that may not be as familiar with these words. “ Even   published a   to Trubek’s piece written by one of its own copy editors. “What exactly is it about digital media that demands the abolition of spelling rules?” Lee Simmons wrote. “Are we saying that professional news sites should spell words in any way that strikes their mood or fancy?” In her essay, Trubek asks: “Who shud tell us how to spel?” answering with, “Let’s make our own rules.”  But she also seems to undermine her own thesis: “Standardized spelling enables readers to understand writing, to aid communication and ensure clarity. Period.” Indeed. That’s why accurate spelling matters. . ",0,Does correct spelling matter to journalists?
"In the wake of  , considerable attention was paid to the fact that the shooter openly advertised his murderous intentions on a recently founded media platform called Gab, favoured by the extreme right. Gab and similar platforms may be new, but the hard truth is that the attack was just a horrific example of an ancient evil — anti-Semitic hatred. The man who gunned down worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue may have used 21st-century tools to carry out his mission, but his hatred of Jews has echoes that go back many centuries. Tragically, there is ample evidence that hate crimes against Jews are on the rise in the United States, in Canada, and in Europe as well. The Pittsburgh attack was the deadliest single incident targeting Jews in American history, according to the Anti-Defamation League, but it’s part of a deeply disturbing trend. The numbers speak for themselves. The ADL says the number of anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. is up by a shocking 57 per cent just since 2017, including the infamous neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., when marchers chanted “Jews will not replace us.” Here in Canada, B’Nai Brith says similar incidents are up by more than a quarter since 2015. In Europe, far-right parties are on the rise and anti-Jewish rhetoric is sneaking back into the mainstream. Jews there also feel targeted by Islamist groups, and sometimes by those who take opposition to Israeli government policies to the point of calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. This is tragic, coming after decades when it seemed that, in North America at least, anti-Semitism had been banished to the far fringes of society and Jews had become more accepted and successful than ever before.  Now we see that anti-Semitism, along with hate crimes directed at other vulnerable groups, is becoming more, not less, common. Even worse, some mainstream politicians in the U.S. are fanning those flames, playing on old tropes that portray Jews as rootless “globalists” conspiring behind the scenes against ordinary Americans. These are stereotypes that should long ago have been erased, but are spreading faster and further than before with the connivance or at least the quiet compliance of too many in authority who should know better. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump himself. It can be no coincidence that his rise to the White House coincided with a marked uptick in hate crimes of all sorts, including anti-Semitic acts. The president has played his well-documented part in giving oxygen to those on the extreme right, as when he notoriously blamed “both sides” for violence around the Charlottesville riot. And as the political atmosphere in the U.S. becomes more heated a week from mid-term elections, Trump has done nothing to calm the waters. Instead, he has gone out of his way to stir up fear and hatred, evidently calculating that will rouse his so-called “base” to get out and vote next Tuesday. He has, for example, demonized the “caravan” of Central Americans attempting to reach the U.S. border, portraying a group of desperate migrants hundreds of kilometres from American territory as an imminent threat to national security. Is it possible to draw a line between that kind of rhetoric and what happened in Pittsburgh? No. But neither is it possible to deny that the political leader with the loudest public voice of all can escape responsibility for creating a climate of intolerance and hatred in which the worst types of extremists feel emboldened and empowered. It is too much to hope at this point that Trump will reverse course and truly act like a leader. He has chosen his path. And given that, it becomes more important than ever for American voters to demonstrate their decency next week and check his power. The stakes could hardly be greater.

"During election campaigns we’ve come to expect over-the-top partisan rhetoric and exaggerations of all kinds — some so big they really are better classified as lies. But once elected, we expect leaders to switch gears and govern, as Doug Ford likes to say, for the people. But Ontario’s premier has never left the hustings, and by his own admission he doesn’t want to.  “I have a rule,” Ford said this week. “As soon as I finish one campaign, I start campaigning right way, the next day.” That’s what had him standing in front of business leaders last week, urging them to “keep fighting with me” against what he referred to as the “forces” supposedly out to thwart him. And this week, he was out lashing the prime minister, just as he would a political opponent on the campaign trail, accusing Justin Trudeau of making promises he can’t keep and “trying to hoodwink us” with his government’s plan to fight climate change. Who knows what enemy, corporeal or not, Ford will find to focus on next week? None of this is good for Ontario.  It perpetuates a sense of crisis rather than opening space for debate on important issues. It seeks to divide people when a leader’s job is to unite them. And, as a method of governing, it’s completely unnecessary since Ford has a majority government. Ford’s actual political opponents — the opposition New Democrats, the rump of the Ontario Liberals and the Green Party’s single determined MPP — all combined cannot stop him from doing much of anything. They simply don’t have the legislative tools to prevent his government from doing pretty much what it wants.  They can delay things a bit with legislative stunts, as the NDP did with rounds of “name that lake” that came with their bill on zebra mussels.  They can try to poke holes in Ford’s most misguided ideas in the hope that his own people will see sense and moderate his views, as seems to have been the case with Health Minister Christine Elliott’s decision to keep safe injection sites open.  But they can’t stop him. As premier, Ford is clearly in a position to make decisions and move forward with his own agenda. And yet, four months after taking the reins of power, he persists with the narrative that he must still fight against sinister “forces” and other people’s ideas. “There are forces in Ontario who had it good under the stagnant Liberal economy, who were happy seeing businesses close and freezing workers out of better jobs,” Ford told a corporate audience in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Friday. It’s ludicrous, as campaign-style rhetoric so often is. No one can fit that description for the simple reason that Ontario’s economy wasn’t “stagnant” under the Wynne government. It was expanding. Indeed, the province’s unemployment rate is among the nation’s lowest, and stands at its lowest level in almost a generation.  Ford is also on the wrong track with his high-profile, high-decibel campaign against Trudeau’s plan to impose a carbon tax on provinces that don’t adopt climate change measures of their own. Ford isn’t opposing the federal plan because he has a better idea; he clearly doesn’t.  He says he’s fighting it because businesses can’t afford it and Trudeau is lying about his plan to rebate the tax to families. “It’s nothing more than a complete scam,” Ford said on Monday. His evidence for that? None. And in his perpetual campaign mode he evidently doesn’t see that as a problem.  It’s high time Ford realized he wasn’t elected castigator-in-chief on June 7. He was elected premier and his job is to govern Ontario for the next four years. To do that, he should stop searching out people, policies and forces to oppose and spend his time explaining how he plans to run the province. As things stand, Ontarians know far too little about that. Ford’s government was elected on the flimsiest of platforms, with no explanation of how it proposes to find $6 billion in “efficiencies” without slashing programs or jobs, while reducing taxes and hydro bills and balancing the books.  The grab-bag of legislation and policies Ford has introduced so far has focused mainly on rolling back everything associated with the Liberal government. That included, right off the bat, ending the province’s cap-and-trade program and, most recently, junking important labour reforms designed to help the lowest-paid workers in the province. We now know that when Ford says “I’m here to fight for the little guy,” he means business owners, not low-wage workers. We have found little positive to say about what Ford has done so far, and given his government’s rhetoric and record so far we doubt we’ll be more pleased with what’s to come. But Ontarians have a right to know a lot more about what this government plans to do — not just what it plans to oppose. It’s time for Ford to declare the campaign over; it’s time for him to govern.

"Donald Trump stood at a podium on Friday and read lines off a teleprompter. Americans, he said, “must never allow political violence to take root... And I am committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it.” Coming from any other president this would be spectacularly unremarkable. It’s the kind of boilerplate language any leader would be expected to utter in the wake of a serious act of political terrorism. Coming from Trump, however, even those banal words were a lie. Far from doing “everything in his power as president” to stop political violence, he was busy feeding the very atmosphere in which it grows. Seeing a puddle of gasoline spreading on the floor, he lights a match and casually tosses it in. Trump has become the United States’ chief political arsonist. The events of the past week, when  and a major media organization, sadly provided yet more evidence. It was bad enough that Trump could not help himself from going on the offence against one of the targets of the attacks, CNN, and the media in general. Far from offering sympathy or support, he chose to tweet out one of his signature slaps at the news media: “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News... Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!” This is all of a piece with Trump’s attacks on the media as “enemies of the people,” his praise for a Republican congressman who body-slammed a reporter, and his happy grin as supporters at his rallies chant “CNN sucks!” even as the network’s headquarters are targeted. None of this is new or even surprising. No one has demonized his political opponents more than Trump. No one has done more to create a climate of hatred, fear and mistrust. And no one has taken so little responsibility for his own actions.  Yet Trump has gone even further in the past week. Before a suspect in the bombing was arrested, his van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, the president gave credence to the bizarre theory that the bombs might actually be the work of Trump’s opponents themselves. The idea was they might be a so-called “false flag” operation designed to discredit Trump and Republicans in advance of the mid-term elections. It began on the fringes of the far right and quickly gained speed with the help of Trump-friendly commentators. Then the president himself weighed in with a tweet about “this ‘Bomb’ stuff” — the quote marks around “bomb” oozing doubt that it was all anything more than a political trick. This is worse than merely vilifying the news media, which has become background noise for Trump. He is now using the power of his office to legitimize the most poisonous types of conspiracy theories that have long lurked in the recesses of American political life.  This, too, isn’t really new. The political scientist Richard Hofstadter laid it all out more than half a century ago in a landmark book called The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Trump has played that tune throughout his rise to power.  As Hofstadter noted decades ago, the danger doesn’t come from the few truly paranoid people who are always isolated on the fringes of society, what he called “men with profoundly disturbed minds.” It is, he wrote, “the use of paranoid modes of expression by more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significant.” One can debate whether Trump is “more or less normal.” What is unquestionably true after the past week is that he and his allies are consciously using “paranoid modes of expression” to give credence to any twisted narrative they believe may serve their political interests. To do that, Trump showed he is perfectly willing to downplay the danger of bringing the threat of violence into the political arena, and just as prepared to countenance the most outlandish conspiracy theories if he thinks that will bring him political advantage. Far from using his power as president to stop violence from taking root, he is cultivating the soil in which it grows. ",0,Donald Trump is feeding the ‘paranoid style’ in American political life
"Having made it through the mess that Premier Doug Ford made of Toronto’s election with his midstream decision to cut city council in half, it’s now time to move the city forward. The newly elected council, along with city staff and residents, needs to figure out how a mayor and 25 councillors can effectively and fairly govern nearly 3 million people. And while Monday’s election left Toronto with new problems it made no dent in one of the most persistent and troubling issues: a city council that looks nothing like the people it’s supposed to represent. Across the city’s 25 wards, only eight women were elected. Toronto’s population is incredibly diverse (some 51 per cent identify as a visible minority), and yet there are just four faces on council that aren’t white. And only four councillors are new; all the others are holdovers from last time and some have been around for decades.  Can anything be done? Mayor John Tory has spoken in general terms about including citizens on community councils as one way to maintain responsive local government now that councillors’ geography and responsibilities have roughly doubled in size. It’s a good idea, one he should pursue. If it’s done well, it could also help to deliver more of the gender balance and diversity so sorely missing on council now. At the moment, Toronto has four community councils made up exclusively of councillors from the city’s four geographic areas. They listen to deputations, arbitrate neighbourhood disputes, deal with local planning matters and have the final authority on a very small number of local issues. Long before Ford slashed the size of city council there were calls to strengthen the role of the community councils. They are most accessible to residents and giving them more power would free up the full council to focus on city-wide issues. A report by the Institute of Municipal Finance and Governance last year recommended broadening the range of issues the local councils deal with and their authority to make decisions — and allowing residents to serve directly on them. It was a good idea then and it’s even more important now. With the reduced size of council these local bodies will have just six or seven councillors apiece. Throw in an absent councillor or two and they’ll struggle to maintain quorum just to hold a meeting, let alone retain the legitimacy to make decisions. The issues before community council are the ones that have the greatest impact in the neighbourhoods people live in, and it’s vital they have a healthy airing where multiple views can be expressed. Some worry that including non-elected citizens may undermine democracy. But there’s no real reason for that concern. True citizen engagement will only strengthen it and the full elected council retains the final say in almost everything (that is, when the premier doesn’t intervene). Citizen members already sit on dozens of city agencies, boards and commissions. That gives them a say in everything from how the TTC operates to the priorities of the board of health, so including them on community councils would not be a big break with current practice. Indeed, even more engaged citizens will be needed for those city bodies since 25 councillors can’t fill all the positions that the old 44-member council did and still have time to do anything else. In both cases, ensuring a better gender balance and broad diversity of voices at those decision-making tables must be a key priority of any selection process. The revamped community councils could help not just in running a better city today but in giving a broader range of people the opportunity to build the experience and public profile they need to run for elected office in the future. There’s nothing revolutionary about all this. Citizens participate on similar local councils all over the world, and all do it differently. Toronto doesn’t have to follow any one model. It would be wise to come up with one best-suited to the political realities the city currently faces, which means not creating a costly new system that the premier would almost certainly veto. To be sure, some councillors will struggle with this. Some won’t want to share power or make it easier for potential future rivals to emerge. Others will only want to encourage voices that echo their own. But Tory — who has spoken strongly about the need to better knit the city together and provide opportunities for disadvantaged groups to participate fully — should take this on as a priority for his new term. Toronto’s community councils came into being with amalgamation, the last time the province forced an unwanted change on the city, claiming it would be more efficient and save money. It didn’t then and there’s no evidence it will now. This latest provincial interference in municipal government might as well be the impetus to make them work better for the city and its residents. This is the best chance for Toronto to salvage something from Ford’s mess and move toward a better future. ",0,Stronger community councils can help to get the diverse voices Toronto needs
"Canadians are just now learning that Statistics Canada has plans to call up the nation’s banks and collect the detailed financial transaction data of 500,000 randomly selected people. At a time when concerns about how personal data is collected and used by public agencies and private corporations grow by the day, it comes as no surprise that many weren’t pleased about this. Nor could they have been happier to have heard about it — just two months before it was to begin — through a Global News report and the subsequent uproar in the House of Commons. Canada’s privacy commissioner, who had been making recommendations to the government agency about how to ensure privacy protections,   As well he should. StatsCan has spent the past few years coming out from under the shadow of the Harper government, which was only to happy to play wedge politics with the agency and went so far as to kill the long-form census. Now, under Justin Trudeau’s government, which rightly supports freeing scientists and promoting accurate data collection to inform public policy decisions, Statistics Canada is clearly flexing its muscles. The data it collects from a host of sources provides vital information that helps determine everything from where health-care funding is directed and new schools are built to understanding how anti-poverty measures and employment programs are working. And, to be sure, collecting accurate data is getting harder as fewer people are willing to participate in surveys or even have a home phone, let alone answer it.  Canada’s chief statistician, Anil Arora, argues the agency is simply adapting to the times — lives (and finances) now happen online — and seeking new sources to get the best data to measure the economy and changes in society. Perhaps this is the best way to gather accurate data, but StatsCan and the government should have to make that case. They should not have let this plan proceed as though it were a proposal for a telephone survey on commuting patterns. If they want the data, they need to show why it’s needed, what will be collected, how it will be used and what safeguards will be in place to ensure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. And if that case   made, more can certainly be done to protect privacy than currently envisioned. Statistics Canada planned to collect the data from the banks and remove all personal identifiers before using the anonymized data for statistical purposes. The better way — as was already recommended by Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien — is to remove personal identifiers   the data is disclosed to the agency. That greatly reduces the chance that any data breach down the line will expose highly sensitive personal information. That StatsCan apparently has the right to get this data from banks — without consent or even requiring that people be told about it — also raises significant concerns about the state of privacy laws. From a purely data point of view, it’s possible to see how that’s desirable. The long-form census, rightly reintroduced by the Trudeau government, is random and mandatory. By asking for consent for banking information it’s no longer random — since some people will say no — and the data skewed. But informed consent is the direction that updated privacy legislation is taking around the world. Statistics Canada itself makes a point of saying that when it shares any information it has with other organizations for statistical purposes it does so “only with your consent.” If the agency feels it needs to skip that step when it comes to something as personal as banking information it should be willing to stand up and convince the public of the need for it.

"“No democracy is safe.”  Sadly, those alarming words from a spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron don’t seem hyperbolic in the wake of the victory of yet another right-wing strongman. Indeed,  , Jair Bolsonaro joins a growing list of leaders that now includes the likes of Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Vladimir Putin of Russia and — of course — President Donald Trump.  His election charts a dangerous course for Brazil and adds to a disturbing trend across several continents. Exaggeration? Sadly not. Consider some of Bolsonaro’s more controversial views:  He has called refugees the “scum of the earth” and disparaged Black people. He has said he would rather his son died in an accident than came out as homosexual; that women don’t deserve equal work opportunities; that he wouldn’t “rape” a fellow lawmaker because she was “not worthy of it”; that he favours torture; and that the solution to violence is more guns. He says democracy doesn’t work but dictatorships do; that protected Indigenous lands should be developed and environmental protections watered down; that he is in favour of torture; that Brazil’s Supreme Court should be stacked in his favour; and that his political opponents should be shot.  It’s understandable that Brazilians would vote for change. After all, nearly 13 million people there are unemployed and the homicide rate is among the highest in the world (nearly 64,000 people were murdered last year). But it’s hard to believe they voted to give up their rights and protections.

"Here’s some good news you might have missed: The Progressive Conservative government is finally doing the right thing — not so much the right-wing thing — on job-creation. Not by cancelling next year’s scheduled increase in the minimum wage —  . Nor by revoking the two paid sick days guaranteed in a new law —  . No, lost in the deservedly negative news coverage of those wrongheaded moves was the fact that the Tories are finally opting for the practical over the ideological in another area entirely. And merit credit for it. After years of delay, dithering and diversion by previous Liberal governments, the PCs have announced they are rolling back one of the biggest obstacles to job training and employment in the province: They are finally putting the   out of its misery — by dismantling the house the Liberals built a decade ago. Perhaps you hadn’t heard of this little-known nest of bloated bureaucracy. Its public profile is minimal, but its obscurity is matched only by its opacity and notoriety among workers, employers and educators. Established by the Liberals, at arm’s length from accountability, the so-called college emerged as the designated regulator of major trades and crafts across the province. It held the keys to training and hiring — and used them to lock down workplaces, lock out workers, and freeze out Ontario’s community colleges from training and placing their students in  . The rogue regulator transplanted a traditional model of self-regulation that has worked (more or less) for professional groups such as doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists. But it was an awkward fit for an unwieldy array of 23 compulsory trades and 133 voluntary trades that are often in opposition to employers — and in competition with rival unions. Trying to get everyone to get along was a recipe for conflict and chaos, paralysis and suffocation. Much of the credit for exposing the bogus college of trades goes to former PC leader Tim Hudak, who pointed out the absurdities in the 2014 election campaign (as I  ): Lopsided hiring ratios that required construction companies to have five journeymen bricklayers on staff for every apprentice they employed; restrictive 4:1 ratios in other trades. Ontario’s system was unique in North America, with no other province imposing such unwieldy hiring restrictions. Ratios of apprentices to veterans tended to be 1:1 in other jurisdictions. Under pressure, then-premier Kathleen Wynne promised to look again at the unwieldy overseer she had inherited from her Liberal predecessor, Dalton McGuinty. A 2015 review led to a revamp, but not the full reset the province required. Many of those ratios were later reduced, but the college’s reputation for rigidity was beyond redemption. A  earlier this year described the plight of an immigrant who couldn’t pass the required 120-question test to become a certified hairstylist, despite his Toronto employer boasting about his skill at cutting hair after 15 years of experience as a barber in his native Iraq. Ontario’s community colleges publicly complained that the province’s severe shortage in the skilled trades would only get worse because of the convoluted process for enrolling apprentices and keeping their numbers down. Employers echoed the demand for reform, noting that jobs were going begging as the economy was booming. Many (but not all) unions remained loyal to the regulator — not least my own newsroom union, Unifor (we are allowed to disagree now and then), for fear that private firms would hire cheaper apprentices over skilled journeymen. But unions have long had a historical blind spot over staffing levels in order to protect wages and benefits — the best example being their resistance to automated newspaper presses when they insisted on bloated “manning” levels. Ontario continued to face a “gap between employers needing apprentices, and apprentices needing employers,” Merrilee Fullerton, the minister of training, colleges and universities, said in an interview. “  heard from apprentices, from employers, business, industry — even my mother’s hairstylist.” Fullerton wants to wind down the college of trades and reduce apprentice ratios. She will phase out regulation of trades that don’t require such intense scrutiny (saddlery and swine herdsperson come to mind). Paradoxically, it’s not an especially ideologically conservative plan — for the Tories may wind up ratcheting up government regulation to replace the self-regulation that went awry under the old system. Another irony is that it wasn’t a repository of partisan patronage — a former PC cabinet minister, David Tsubouchi, was appointed by the Liberals to run the old college of trades, and long defended its ossified structures. But dismantling the old system is the right thing for Fullerton to do. Even if if turns out not to be as right-wing a plan as many Tories might imagine.

"After spending three long months conducting an “evidence-based review” of whether overdose prevention and supervised injection sites actually save lives, Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott has concluded they do that — and much more.  They also reduce the incidence of needle-transmitted diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C and lower rates of public drug use, she acknowledged. And they improve the health of those who use drugs, are cost-effective and reduce the strain on the health care system. None of this is any surprise. Study after study around the world has shown it to be so.  What   something of a surprise is that the minister could actually acknowledge all that in the face of Premier Doug Ford’s campaign promise to close down all these life-saving sites. Who can forget Ford’s unequivocal declaration last April that he was “dead against” what he called “safe injection areas”? Nonetheless, Elliott announced that the government will allow 21 sites to operate in the province under a new name: Consumption and Treatment Services. That is no small victory in a government whose ministers have repeatedly ignored evidence-based decisions to please the premier. Elliott deserves credit for not caving in to Ford’s campaign trail pronouncements. But, sadly, what she spelled out is not enough.  The fact is that even as the minister acknowledged the importance of the facilities, she then   she is putting the brakes on opening any new sites. The 21 sites she said the government will allow just happens to include the 18 currently operating and three more that have already been approved in Toronto, St. Catharines and Thunder Bay.  This is a dangerous limitation. It will leave entire cities, never mind communities, without the life-saving facilities that addicts need in the middle of an opioid overdose crisis that killed 1,100 in this province last year. That’s an alarming increase of 50 per cent over the year before. Further, the decision to limit the number of sites was made even as she admitted in a   that the current levels of addiction treatment, mental health services and supportive housing options available for addicts in Ontario are “inadequate.” It gets worse. Elliott also announced there will be no new funding for existing sites. This, too, is a dangerous decision. Many of the facilities have only enough funding now to operate for limited hours, leaving addicts with no recourse but to inject on streets and in alleyways without supervision when the sites are closed. And she has outright banned any pop-up sites run by volunteer harm reduction workers from opening.  This is a setback in the fight against overdoses, where quick and nimble saves the day. In fact, Toronto’s first overdose prevention site in downtown Moss Park was opened in a tent in August 2017 by volunteers in the absence of any official sites. In just nine months of operation they overturned 200 overdoses.  The sad fact is that all these restrictions ignore the fact that this is a growing crisis, one that Canada’s chief public health officer blamed this week for a recent drop in Canadian’s life expectancy. More resources, not less, are required to reverse course.  To her credit, Elliott has averted the disaster that would have ensued if the existing sites were closed and hundreds more addicts died as a result. But there’s a real risk that other lives won’t be saved by new overdose prevention sites and additional funding for existing facilities.  That trade-off is not acceptable. The minister should act on the evidence she has gathered and fight to open more sites. The battle against opioid overdoses is far from won.

"The Ford government is right to crack down on teachers found guilty of sexually abusing students in any way. Up until now, the law in Ontario has mandated that a teacher lose his or her licence only for committing the most serious types of sexual acts. Anything short of that and the law doesn’t require the Ontario College of Teachers to revoke the offender’s licence. The result has been that some teachers have gotten away with groping or kissing students, or sending sexually charged messages. They’ve been given a slap on the wrist and gone back to the classroom. Some have then reoffended. The Wynne government promised to fix the situation, but it didn’t go far enough. Now  that will replace the existing list of banned sexual acts with broader wording. It will require that teachers be kicked out of the profession if they’re found to have engaged in “any and all forms of sexual abuse” involving students. We haven’t seen the fine print, but this provision of the government’s Safe and Supportive Classrooms Act appears to be the right fix for a persistent and troubling problem. It’s unacceptable that teachers implicated in abuse be allowed to keep on teaching. Thompson’s bill also tackles another ongoing issue — the worrisome decline in math scores. That’s a complicated problem and the government has chosen to start by requiring new teachers to pass a basic math test before getting their teaching licence. Many experts have identified inadequate math training among teachers as one of the factors contributing to falling math scores. And some universities have added courses on math basics for student teachers to help fill the gap. It’s a sensible move. The government is going a bit further by requiring new teachers to pass a math test, and it may get push-back on that from some educators. But declining math scores spell trouble ahead for students and Ontario’s economy as whole. Teachers should be prepared to do their part in turning that around.

"More than a decade after Ashley Smith’s death in solitary confinement,  inspired by her tragic case to overhaul the rules governing inmates in segregation.  Bill C-83 takes positive steps to ensure prisoners held in isolation are treated far more humanely than she was, but the legislation falls short in addressing several outstanding concerns. After all this time, the government should get it right.  Readers may recall that Smith was just 15 years old when she was jailed simply for throwing crab apples at a postal worker, and how her four-month sentence grew to four years for assault and vandalism — charges racked up for acting out in prison. In the final year of her life in federal custody, she was locked up for as much as 23 hours a day without any meaningful human contact. If that wasn’t torture enough she was forcibly restrained and injected with drugs against her will. In the end, Smith choked herself to death at the age of 19 with a strip of cloth, while guards looked on and did nothing. A coroner’s jury ultimately ruled her death a homicide.  Under the new legislation inmates who pose risks to themselves or others — as Smith was labelled — would be moved to new “structured intervention units.” They will be allowed to spend four hours a day outside their cell and at least two of those hours interacting with other people. Prisoners in these units would also be visited daily by a health-care professional and provided with access to patient advocates — all things that could have saved Smith. But the bill does not spell the end of solitary confinement, as the government claims. It just provides for a better version of it, and one that conveniently falls just outside the United Nations technical definition of it. As correctional ombudsman Ivan Zinger says: “If I lock you up in a bathroom and only allow you out for four hours instead of two hours, it’s still a very restrictive environment.”  So it’s particularly troubling that the government did not include in its legislation a cap on how long prisoners can be held in these special units. That would have provided the necessary impetus to ensure authorities look for solutions for these inmates, many of whom suffer from serious mental health issues that are only made worse by their time in solitary. The negative effects of long-term solitary confinement are well documented and can include psychosis, hallucinations, insomnia and confusion. Reports from special investigators, ombudsmen, human rights organizations and the United Nations all say that extended stays in solitary confinement often preclude rehabilitation. In fact, the UN describes durations in solitary beyond 15 days as a form of torture. But the legislation that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is calling “world-leading” only goes so far as to say an inmate’s confinement in the special units should end “as soon as possible.”  That’s not good enough. And there’s no way to know if the prison system is following even that vague encouragement since the government didn’t include any independent oversight and monitoring of solitary confinement cases. Independent oversight of segregation decisions is something human rights advocates have long called for, and something the government should revisit. To its credit, the Trudeau government has already taken major steps to reduce the number of prisoners who are held in solitary. There are currently 341 inmates in segregation, a big drop from the daily averages of 800 three years ago.  That’s a positive trend that must continue. The numbers cannot be allowed to creep up with these proposed segregation-lite units, as critics fear will happen. The government should improve its bill to ensure that such fears don’t come to pass.

"Over the past few days, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for the defeat of the prime minister, while members of Trudeau’s cabinet have called out the Ontario government for peddling false facts and the “politics of cruelty.”  Trudeau and Ford must really be looking forward to the first ministers’ conference due to be held in the coming weeks — most likely in the first week of December. The awkward photos will be priceless.  While it’s more the rule than the exception to have opposing parties in power at Queen’s Park and on Parliament Hill, relations between the Ford and Trudeau governments appear to be particularly raw, and especially so this week.  On Tuesday, federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer visited Queen’s Park and was warmly greeted by the premier as the “next prime minister of Canada” — a development that would come, Ford said at a photo op in his office, after voters “get rid” of Trudeau in next year’s election.  It’s not the first time we’ve heard leaders talk like this. Former prime minister Stephen Harper was no big fan of Liberal premiers Dalton McGuinty or Kathleen Wynne and also  — but those suggestions generally came at fundraisers or in off-hand remarks, not at official government podiums.  Meanwhile, federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen was accused once again this week of giving the back of the hand to his Ontario counterpart, Lisa MacLeod.  In an interview on Thursday night with CBC’s Power and Politics, Hussen said MacLeod was “engaged in fear mongering and using this issue to demonize people.” As for MacLeod’s   that 40 per cent of Toronto shelter occupants are refugees, Hussen said: “The figures that are being thrown around are not based on facts.”  MacLeod responded on Twitter that Hussen was a “ .” That charge also isn’t new — the two ministers have been   almost since the Ford government came to office last summer.  Trudeau’s labour minister, Patty Hajdu, was also plunging into the fray this week, announcing a wave of new worker protections very similar to the ones that have recently been  by the Ford government.  Hajdu spoke out against what she called the “politics of cruelty” and the “devastating” spectacle of governments rolling back worker benefits.  Now, it should be noted that this wasn’t exactly Ottawa rushing in to serve as a backstop to Ford’s cuts — the measures announced by Hajdu apply only to federally regulated workers and most workers in Ontario are governed by provincial laws. As well, federal Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told me last month that Ottawa could not as a “court of appeal” on provincial matters, even if it does disagree with them.  But Hajdu’s announcement was clearly intended to draw some sharp, political distinctions between the two governments and help frame the Liberals’ platform for next year’s federal election. So was Trudeau’s announcement of the carbon tax rebate — right in Ford’s backyard of Etobicoke — a couple of weeks ago.  This harsh state of relations between Ontario and Ottawa tells us a lot about the larger picture of politics in Canada as we head into a federal election year. It’s the story of big global forces — Canada picking up on the polarized tone of debate south of the border, for sure — but also the small world of Canadian politics.  There is plenty of cross-pollination between partisans in Queen’s Park and Ottawa at present. Trudeau’s government has been built around strong connections to Ontario Liberals. His two chief advisers, Gerald Butts and Katie Telford, are veterans of the old McGuinty government. Ford’s new government, similarly, has been drawing on a raft of staff connections to the old Harper regime, including  , who served as Harper’s campaign manager and deputy chief of staff, and is now installed in the premier’s office.  All politics is personal, as they say, but this migrating network of Liberals and Conservatives, who all know each other and who have fought campaigns against one another, make things ultra-personal in the Ontario-Ottawa relationship at present.  For politics-watchers, though, these federal-provincial skirmishes are like the trailer for the election movie coming next year. Want a sneak peek at the fall of 2019? Look no further than the battles we saw between the Ford and Trudeau governments this week — and the ones we’ll be seeing over the coming weeks too.

"With the Toronto election over and new councillors soon to take their place in the chamber at city hall, preparations for the next stage of the ongoing fight over the number of wards in the city are just beginning. The province filed fresh evidence last week in an appeal of a   that Premier Doug Ford’s council-cutting legislation,  , was unconstitutional. That appeal will be heard starting June 10. Though Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba ruled Sept. 10 that the legislation tabled by the rookie premier and former city councillor without any prior notice should be stuck down, the province was successful in convincing a higher court to   — essentially putting the court ruling on hold until the appeal could be heard. That set the stage for the   to go ahead with a smaller,   instead of the planned 47 wards approved by council years earlier. What’s next in the court fight is the June hearing at the Court of Appeal. In a new motion filed with the court, Crown lawyers representing the province are asking that they be allowed to submit new evidence — which is typically not permitted at the appeal stage. They argue that Belobaba did not give the province enough time to bring experts, conduct cross-examinations or prepare materials in defence of Bill 5. “The result was a failure of procedural fairness to Ontario,” the motion says, also noting several experts declined their requests to participate because of the time frame for the earlier August hearing. The new evidence the province wants to submit includes that of two experts. The first expert is political scientist and University of Chicago professor Anthony Fowler, who specializes in elections and representation. He provided analysis of the most recent and previous elections. By looking at the makeup of the newly-elected council and that of previous elections, Fowler concluded that “the representation of historically under-represented groups — as a proportion of the overall council — did not decrease.” He noted that 16 per cent of newly elected council members are visible minorities, compared to 9 to 11 per cent in the previous four elections. As well, the number of women elected was maintained at 32 per cent of council. There is still only one openly LGBTQ member on council. Fowler also argued that under a 47-ward system there was unlikely to be a greater proportion of minority representatives elected, largely because the distribution of minority residents across wards is similar in each of the different ward systems.  Though Fowler determined incumbency advantage — the likelihood a sitting councillor will be re-elected — was significantly reduced in the most recent election, he noted there were a number of head-to-head incumbent battles and likely looser ties between incumbents and their constituents given the expanded wards. The expert evidence comes as a response to arguments made earlier from the opposite side of the courtroom —   represented by teams of lawyers who opposed Bill 5, saying it infringed their charter rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and equality. A second expert who provided evidence for the province was political science professor emeritus, Andrew Sancton, who taught at the University of Western Ontario. Sancton, who also provided evidence during an   at a provincial tribunal over ward boundaries brought by two city councillors, argued in his affidavit that among other issues he sees with more wards is that having 47 councillors “is a recipe for exceptionally long meetings . . . general disorganization, and a focus on parochialism rather than the best interest of the city as a whole.” In the coming months, those who fought Bill 5 will respond with materials and the province’s written arguments will be filed in court. The June appeal will be heard by a rare five-member panel of the Court of Appeal after the request for a stay was heard by a three-member panel of judges. If the court overrules Belobaba and Bill 5 remains intact, the other parties could appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. First that court would have to agree to hear the case, before a hearing would take place in Ottawa — often a years-long process. If Belobaba’s earlier ruling that Bill 5 is unconstitutional is upheld, it’s not clear what remedy the court would allow. The province has indicated it would want time to craft new legislation or an alternative solution in place of Bill 5.

"Former B.C. premier Gordon Campbell says he still supports a carbon tax — as long as it’s revenue-neutral. The right-of-centre politician was at the helm of the first government in North America to introduce a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2008. Now, as Conservative politicians across Canada mount a loud opposition to carbon pricing at the federal and provincial levels, Campbell told a committee of the Ontario legislature last week he would keep his in place, if he were still in power. The former premier was appointed to chair Premier Doug Ford’s commission of inquiry into Ontario’s finances in July. He commented on the carbon tax while speaking to the legislature’s Select Committee on Financial Transparency about the  . A   of his testimony to the committee was posted to the legislature’s website on Thursday. In the final report, he and the two other commissioners listed climate change as one of six risks that could hurt Ontario’s economic growth — and impact the province’s fiscal position — in the near- or long-term. The findings come as the Ford government cancels legislated emissions targets and the province’s cap-and-trade system, and launches a legal fight against Ottawa’s imposition of a federal carbon tax. The NDP on the committee used the comments in the report to try to get Campbell’s thoughts on a carbon tax. While the Progressive Conservative committee chair, Prabmeet Sarkaria, shut down some of those questions, he did allow others. Asked by NDP MPP John Vanthof if he would cancel the carbon tax he brought in while in government, Campbell replied: “No.” He added that the point of the comments in the report was to highlight “a whole number of things that we may have to deal with as we go forward.” “Climate change could be reflected in (longer) forest-fire seasons, increased flooding, (and) unusual weather events,” he said. “There is a whole series of things outside of Ontario’s ambit that are going to have an impact on Ontario, and climate change is potentially one of them.” Speaking to iPolitics after the committee, Campbell said his message to Conservative politicians who are against the carbon tax is that “the key is to make it revenue-neutral.” “I think there should be a revenue-neutral carbon tax, yes,” Campbell said. “Our tax was a carbon-emission tax. Effectively, we’re saying carbon emissions are bad; hard work and income is good. We’ll reduce your income taxes and we’ll cover that off with your carbon tax.” He added that he’s “disappointed” that B.C.’s carbon tax is no longer revenue-neutral. When asked what he thinks of the carbon-tax plan released by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week, Campbell did not answer. ",0,Former B.C. premier Gordon Campbell still supports a carbon tax
"The Progressive Conservatives “crossed a line” by having Ontario’s chief medical officer — a senior civil servant — appear in a TV news-style video by the governing party’s partisan publicity arm, critics charge.  Dr. David Williams was in an item about the importance of getting a flu shot  by the taxpayer-funded PC caucus   social media operation that follows Premier Doug Ford and cabinet ministers to events. While Government House Leader Todd Smith argued the content amounted to a harmless public service announcement and accused rival parties of playing “political games,” opposition MPPs said Thursday the doctor’s appearance sets a potentially dangerous precedent jeopardizing the neutrality of the civil service.  “They crossed a line when they asked a public servant to appear on partisan advertising,” said interim Liberal leader John Fraser, echoing concerns from the NDP.  “What’s next? ‘We want you to say this?’, Fraser added. “When they ask a public servant (to appear), does the public servant feel obligated to do that because they have new masters? It puts them in a very awkward position.” Williams did not reply to a request for comment from the Star but the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying “the government is committed to using every communications tool available” to promote flu shots. The statement did not address queries about a senior public servant appearing on a partisan political publicity vehicle.  New Democrat MPP Sara Singh said government public service announcements should be made through official channels, not through the PC party’s publicity wing in a way that is “blurring the lines” between partisan politics and the civil service. “Ontario News Now is being used by this government as a quote-unquote media outlet and we all know that’s false,” she told reporters. “Ontario News Now is an outlet that was created by the Ford administration and is extremely partisan … it’s confusing to people that are watching that thinking it’s real news and really it is not.” Speaking for the government, Smith characterized Ontario News Now as “a modern-day newsletter” and maintained the importance of flu shots “is not a partisan issue.” Smith added the PC caucus is entitled to decide how to spend its budget, supplied from taxpayers by the Legislative Assembly. The New Democrats, as the official opposition, also have a caucus budget.  “We have made a decision that instead of spending … hundreds of thousands of dollars, probably, out in newsletters, that this is a more effective way. More people will be engaged. I know that people are tired of getting those old newsletters in the mail. Most of them end up in the garbage,” Smith said.  He replied “I don’t know” when asked if other civil servants would be asked to appear on Ontario News Now, in which former broadcast journalist and current Ford staffer Lyndsey Vanstone plays the role of “reporter” doing breezy, flattering and uncritical items about government initiatives. The videos are then posted on the Ontario News Now page on   and other social media. Ontario News Now gets details of Ford’s itinerary that Queen’s Park television, radio and newspaper reporters are not given, allowing Vanstone to follow the premier to more announcements.  Vanstone’s crew has also run afoul of security officials at the Legislature, repeatedly filming interviews and “stand ups” in hallways where only accredited media outlets are allowed to do so. In one recent case, the crew was told by a special constable to stop filming on the main floor and promptly walked upstairs to try on the second floor, where they were intercepted by another security officer. Opposition parties have called on Ontario auditor general Bonnie Lysyk to investigate the TV-style reports, which Fraser of the Liberals has dubbed “fake news.” ",0,PCs criticized for using chief medical officer in video
"The federal government has introduced new legislation to protect vulnerable workers including three paid emergency leave days, scheduling rights, equal pay for temps and casual workers, and measures to prevent contract flipping — as Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives move to repeal similar protections in Ontario. Making the announcement at George Brown College to a room of union leaders and young workers Thursday, federal employment minister Patty Hajdu blasted the provincial changes as the “politics of cruelty,” and called it “devastating to watch really fundamental protections be rolled back.” “This country is so much better off when everyone has a fair chance at success,” she said.  “One thing we heard over and over and over is that those most vulnerable workers are not protected,” she added. “They’re being asked to work incredibly hard for very low wages with very little predictability and with no protections for when life happens.” The newly announced updates to the Canada Labour Code would impact workers in federally-regulated sectors like airlines, telecommunications, trucking, and banks, which employ around 900,000 people across the country.  The vast majority of employees in Ontario rely on provincial employment laws for their rights on the job, but the federal measures are of particular significance for workers at Pearson International Airport — who have long demanded protection against  and called for a federally mandated minimum wage. The Star has previously reported on the practice known as  , which refers to when employers award contracts to different service providers every few years, forcing workers to reapply for their jobs — often losing any wage increases and benefits earned under their previous employer. The new federal measures apply to airports and airlines, and mean that workers will keep their salary rates when contracts change hands. Dan Janssen, a baggage handler at  and the vice-president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 2323, which represents airport workers, said he welcomed the changes. “It became a race to the bottom (at Pearson) so we’re glad to see that is finally going to be addressed,” he told the Star. He said he would be watching to ensure the new language had “real value” in practise, but said he believed that “raising the floor is always a good thing to do.” “Whether it’s unions doing that or unions fighting for better protections, it’s important that we raise the floor in terms of minimum standards. We all benefit when that happens, unionized or not.” The new legislation, introduced on Parliament Hill on Monday, will provide employees in federally regulated industries with five days of personal leave, three of which will be paid. It will allow workers to refuse last-minute shifts without fear of reprisal. It will also make it illegal to pay part-time, temporary, and casual workers less than their permanent counterparts. In 2006, an extensive report to the federal government by labour law expert  noted “workers in the federal jurisdiction tend to be higher paid and enjoy better overall working conditions.” But it also warned of the rise of part-time and temporary work in some sectors, and its impact on groups like women and new Canadians in particular. The report made numerous proposals to better protect such workers. Hajdu cited the Arthurs report and Bill 148, the labour reforms enacted last year under Ontario’s previous Liberal government, as the template for the federal changes. Last week, the province introduced new legislation,  , to repeal many of those reforms — including two paid sick days, equal pay for equal work, scheduling protections, and a $15 minimum wage that had been due to kick in in January. “It’s a real step in the wrong direction,” Janssen said of Bill 47. “It’s almost like yin and yang with what’s happening with the federal government and provincial government.” Currently, federal sector employees are entitled to the minimum wage rates set by their respective provinces. Hajdu said Thursday the federal government will establish a task force to examine that issue, after the results of a 10-month consultation found strong support for a minimum wage of $15 or more in federally regulated industries. The new federal legislation also bolsters the Wage Earner Protection Program, which provides financial support to workers who are owed wages after their employer files for bankruptcy. The government also introduced gender-based pay equity legislation earlier this week requiring employers with 10 or more workers to examine their pay practices and ensure men and women are compensated equally for work of equal value.  “We believe that this will set the stage for good quality jobs which is profitable,” said Hajdu. “Smart employers already know this.” ",0,"Ottawa rolls out new worker protections, blasts Ontario’s ‘politics of cruelty’"
"Stakeholders say there is still hope for a Ryerson University campus in Brampton despite the Ontario government’s announcement last week it was pulling provincial funding for the project. According to Brampton West MPP, Amarjot Sandhu, his PC government is still willing to work with the city and university as long as it doesn’t involve capital funding. “I’d like to first remark that of course I, like many parents and prospective students in Brampton, would love to have a university campus in our city,” he told the Brampton Guardian in an emailed statement. “I would like to reiterate that we are not against a university in Brampton. Our government would be willing to consider a business case for the Ryerson proposal in the absence of capital funding,” he added. The Ford government announced on Oct. 23, that  , including $90 million promised by the previous provincial Liberal government for a downtown Brampton Ryerson University satellite campus. Funding for a York University/Seneca College expansion in Markham, as well as monies for a Wilfrid Laurier University/Conestoga College expansion in Milton also got the axe. Sandhu said the reason for the government’s decision was a larger than expected budgetary deficit. “Thanks to the Independent Commission of Inquiry, we found out that the Liberals were running a $15-billion deficit and lying to the taxpayers about it. Our government is now given the task of cleaning up the fiscal mess they left behind. Unfortunately, that involves some hard choices on the part of our government,” he said.

"Finance Minister Vic Fedeli will reveal the state of Ontario’s books in the fall economic statement on Nov. 15. It will be a “mini-budget” meaning there are expected to be some tax changes and further spending cuts. “The days of phoney numbers in Ontario are over,” Fedeli told reporters on Thursday. “We will present to the people of Ontario for the first time in a long time a true and current state of finances in the province,” he said. Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives, who toppled former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals in the June 7 election, have been claiming Ontario has a $15-billion deficit. But that inflated number includes $5.7 billion in Liberal election promises that the Tories do not plan to keep. As well, it is based on auditor general Bonnie Lysyk’s disputed accounting treatment that does not count $11 billion in government-sponsored public pension plans, which are worth $5 billion on the annual bottom line. Lysyk and her predecessors booked the holdings as an asset starting in 2002, but she changed her mind two years ago after a tiff with the Liberal government. A panel of independent experts hired by Liberals — and led by the chair of the Canadian Actuarial Standards Oversight Council — concluded last year she was wrong. Fedeli, however, noted the Tories will continue to use Lysyk’s accounting for the time being.  In the Liberals’ March 28 budget, Wynne’s government forecast a $6.7-billion deficit for 2018-19. Using the different accounting method, the auditor general estimated in her in pre-election report that the shortfall is $11.7 billion. But Ford’s independent “financial commission of inquiry,” headed by former B.C. Liberal premier Gordon Campbell, warned the new government should only adopt Lysyk’s accounting method on a “provisional basis” while negotiating with her. “It would seem reasonable that the government should be able to recognize a portion of an asset it jointly controls with another party,” Campbell’s report concluded on the joint-sponsored Ontario Public Service Employees’ Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. “Given the risks and uncertainties involved, they may not feel it appropriate for the government to recognize its full 50 per cent share of the surplus. By the same token, however, it seems unlikely they would conclude the value to be zero.” Interim Liberal leader John Fraser said he expects Fedeli’s fall economic statement to reflect the government’s bent for axing measures brought in by the Grits. “That’s going to continue. The car’s in reverse and it doesn’t look like they’re taking their foot off the gas,” said Fraser, predicting the Nov. 15 deficit will be billions lower than the Tories’ $15-billion tally because they’re cancelling Liberal initiatives. “I suspect you might see a lower number they will take credit for.” During the spring campaign, the Tories warned they would make the equivalent of $6 billion in cuts to an annual provincial budget that exceeds $150 billion.

"Never mind Doug Ford’s economic roadmap. Seen his new road signs? “Welcome to Ontario — Open for Business.” The promised new slogan is coming soon to our border crossings, pointing the way to provincial prosperity. It began with bumper sticker politics, when   boldly declared himself leader of Ontario’s first-ever “Government for the People.” Now, it culminates with road signs that shall be our shortcut to economic success. “Open for Business” will surely make American visitors feel at home, for it has a familiar ring: Economic titans such as Arizona, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin adopted that entrepreneurial (if unoriginal credo) years ago. For better or for worse. A year after deploying “Open for Business” signage to jumpstart West Virginia’s economy, then-governor Joe Manchin conceded the slogan had sputtered. “Criticism has been rampant ever since,” noted the West Virginian Times in a cutting article about the “highly unpopular slogan.” Voters dumped the phrase in a subsequent government-organized poll. Maryland didn’t much love it either. A columnist in the Baltimore Sun derided the slogan as simply “cheesy,” asking readers what message the state was sending to visitors: “Further reduce industrial regulation? Hand out massive tax breaks? Is that what we’re all about? And if we’re open for business now, does that mean we were closed before?” Good questions for Ontarians, too. In our premier’s defence, he never made a secret of the slogan. And in fairness to Ford, the signage isn’t empty symbolism. The broad outlines of his roadmap were visible to voters when he won the last election, promising to freeze the minimum wage, erect those road signs, and tear down labour laws. While many economists and the occasional columnist might have criticized it as a race to the bottom — where bottom-feeding states such as Maine, West Virginia and Wisconsin long ago proclaimed themselves “Open for Business” — Ford won fair and square. And many are cheering his progress, not least the business sector. Ford’s friends in the Ontario Chamber of Commerce gave him a standing ovation last week for a speech sprinkled with partisan attacks against his political enemies, and laden with offerings for small business: Cutting red tape, cutting taxes, cutting unions down to size, cutting out workplace reforms enacted by the defeated Liberal government a year ago. And clawing back a scheduled increase in the minimum wage to $15 next year. As the Tories like to say, “Promise made, promise kept.” But here’s one promise Ford never made, because he didn’t have to — because the Liberals did it for him: Last year, with an election looming, then-premier Kathleen Wynne tried to calm small business critics by offering a quid pro quo for her labour reforms. To take the edge of the minimum wage hike, the Liberal government handed a handsome  to small business, along with hiring subsidies for young workers. In their November economic statement a year ago, they reduced the small business tax rate from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent (that’s a 22-per-cent decrease) on the first $500,000 in corporate income — compared to 8 per cent in Quebec. They also announced a $1,000 rebate for smaller employers hiring young people, with another $1,000 payoff after six months. The rationale for those giveaways was always more electoral than economical. Liberals, like their NDP and PC counterparts, can’t resist wooing small businesses and “family businesses” as the human face of good-guy capitalism, the poster child of entrepreneurialism. Nothing against the little guy — small can be beautiful — but economists will tell you what politicians won’t: Small business subsidies don’t make sense if they merely incentivize firms to remain small rather than scale up to capture market share and boost overall economic growth. Now, the dubious rationale behind those tax breaks is dated. With the Ford government dismantling many of those labour reforms — two days of paid sick leave, scheduling protections, equal pay for temporary workers — why are they sticking with those compensating tax cuts and subsidies? If we are back to the status quo ante, the quid pro quo no longer adds up. Next year’s $15 minimum wage increase has been declawed, but don’t expect the Progressive Conservatives to claw back those old Liberal tax cuts, or scale back those compensating subsidies. In Ford’s Ontario, the road signs only point in one direction: Open for Business. Just like all those U.S. states racing to the bottom.

"OTTAWA—A new poll suggests Canadians warmed to the federal government’s carbon price plan after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced most people hit by Ottawa’s fuel levy would get rebates that outweigh the cost of the tax. The Angus Reid Institute conducted an   of 1,500 Canadian adults from Oct. 24 to 29, the six days after Trudeau unveiled details of the Liberal government’s plan to deter greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change with a price on carbon. A slim majority of respondents — 54 per cent — said they support the carbon price plan, while 46 per cent said they oppose it.  That’s a nine-point uptick from an Angus Reid poll in July, when 45 per cent supported the federal carbon price and 55 per cent opposed it.  The latest survey also found support for the carbon price in Ontario — where Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford is campaigning against the new levy on fuel — jumped by 11 points from 43 per cent in July to 54 per cent last week. A randomized poll with this sample size carries a margin of error of plus/minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  Angus Reid executive director Shachi Kurl said that, while there appears to be a bump in support for Trudeau’s carbon price, her data shows Canadians remain starkly divided on the issue. She pointed to how her poll shows 80 per cent of respondents who voted Conservative in 2015 oppose the carbon price plan, while 71 per cent of Liberal voters and 69 per cent of NDP voters support the plan. “It is very much a tale of two countries, and a tale of two views on this issue,” Kurl said.  “I think we have to wait and see whether that slight uptick in support holds.” A separate survey published Tuesday also suggests support for the carbon price plan has gone up recently. Almost half (47 per cent) of respondents to an   conducted Oct. 26 to 28 by Innovative Research Group said they “strongly” or “somewhat” support the federal carbon price plan — up from 35 per cent in July. Innovative Research Group President Greg Lyle said he expected the policy to be more divisive in provinces like Ontario, where 45 per cent of respondents backed the plan.  The weighted representative sample of 1,200 Canadian adults were from the same panel Innovative Research uses for monthly public affairs research, Lyle said.  “We actually found pretty broad initial acceptance,” he said, pointing to how even some Conservative supporters — those who don’t include themselves in the anti-elite Conservative camp — also seemed to be split on the carbon price. “That’s why, initially, it’s not having the political effect that you think it would.”  In 2016, Ottawa ordered provinces and territories to come up with their own carbon pricing schemes that meet federal standards, or risk having the federal plan imposed in their jurisdictions. Trudeau announced last week that the federal plan would be imposed in four provinces that refused to devise their own pricing systems that Ottawa deemed adequate: Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick.  Trudeau also said all revenues from the carbon levy will be returned directly to residents of those provinces through new “climate action incentive” rebates that will outweigh the extra costs to gasoline, home heating and other purchases.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with premiers in Ontario and Saskatchewan, attacked the plan as a tax grab in disguise, and cast doubt on Trudeau’s claim that most people wouldn’t lose money to the carbon levy. Those provinces are also challenging Ottawa in court over whether it has the authority to impose the levy in their jurisdictions.

"Premier Doug Ford launched his $106,700 “open for business” border-crossing signs in Sarnia as Statistics Canada revealed Ontario unemployment continues to hover near its lowest rate in a generation. “Doesn’t that sign look beautiful?” Ford said Friday morning of the “Welcome to Ontario: Open For Business” signage near the Blue Water Bridge to Michigan. “You’ve been hearing for months that we’re going to put signs right across every single border in Ontario to tell the world, especially our great neighbours to the south, that Ontario is open for business,” said the premier. There will eventually be 25 such signs placed at all 18 of the province’s land crossings with American states. After a week of opposition and media questions about the price tag of the Tory campaign promise, Ford’s office said later Friday that the new and replacement signage would cost taxpayers an estimated $106,700.  The blue metal highway signs, designed in-house and produced by the Ministry of Transportation, range from $3,300 to $8,000, including manufacturing, shipping, and installation.  “Of the 18 locations where signs will be upgraded, three locations are missing four signs and must be replaced. The cost of replacing the four missing signs is estimated to be $32,000, and the estimated cost of upgrading 21 existing signs is $74,700,” Ford’s office said. NDP MPP Catherine Fife said that’s a waste of public money, a point underscored by the fact the economy continues to perform well. “We’ve seen this government stumbling along,” Fife (Waterloo) told reporters at Queen’s Park. Ford’s announcement came the same morning as Statistics Canada’s monthly jobs survey revealed last month’s unemployment rate dropped to 5.6 per cent, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points since September. “While employment was little changed in Ontario, there were fewer people looking for work, lowering the unemployment rate … On a year-over-year basis, employment in the province rose by 83,000 due to more full-time work,” said Statistics Canada. That’s a 1.2 per cent increase in employment since this time last year. Still, the premier touted his repeal of the previous Liberal government’s labour reforms, which would have increased the $14-an-hour   to $15 in January and given employees two paid sick days and other workplace protections. “That was just hurdle after hurdle for  , medium businesses, large businesses,” said Ford, a wealthy businessman who previously ran his family’s label-printing company. “We’re getting rid of as many regulations as possible,” he said. But Fife warned that his cuts will force workers to “make tough choices.” “Without paid sick days, they’ll have to choose between taking their kid to the doctor when she’s sick, or keeping the day’s pay she needs to care for her family,” she said. “Ontarians who work hard deserve more respect than that.”  Liberal MPP Michael Coteau said Statistics Canada’s numbers suggest “this Conservative government is disconnected from reality when it comes to the economy.” “Ontario has always been business-friendly, with or without a bumper-sticker slogan,” said Coteau (Don Valley East), lambasting the signs. “This is a distraction and cold comfort to workers who just had their benefits slashed and their wage increase cancelled. The is not a ‘government for the people.’ It is a government that thinks social programs and job benefits are red tape that should be steamrolled to make businesses more profitable.” ",0,Premier unveils ‘open for business’ signs as Ontario’s unemployment rate remains low
"Doug Ford has turned a page on his relationship with his predecessor Kathleen Wynne. The current premier initially rejected a gift of two books from the former premier — books by author, Toronto Star reporter and  — as he is “very cautious when it comes to accepting gifts,” said Ford spokesperson Simon Jefferies. “He didn’t know the cost of the books at the time,” Jefferies said Wednesday afternoon. “The premier has since accepted the books.” Earlier in the day in the legislature, Wynne said she had attended the Massey lecture Tuesday night in Toronto, given by Talaga, “an Indigenous woman who has shone a light on past and current abuses that have created the urgent crisis of youth suicide in Indigenous communities. “I’ve sat in many seats in this legislature, starting up in the visitors’ gallery in the 1990s, and in every seat that I’ve sat in, I’ve been able to see the increasing harshness of the debate in this house,” Wynne said.  “It occurred to me again last night that one of the serious casualties of partisan political polarization is the possibility of any collaborative move towards reconciliation.” Wynne spent about $40 on the tomes —  , and  but when she sent them over to Ford during question period, the premier said “I can’t receive gifts” and passed them to his seat-mate, Finance Minister Vic Fedeli. Wynne replied: “You can’t receive gifts?” later saying “I believe that the premier will find that the gift of the two books falls well within the ability of the premier to accept the level of gift.” The limit for members of provincial parliament is $200. “I was surprised,” by the rejection, Wynne said. “I wanted to do it in public so I understand that there’s an element of public display about that, but I wanted to do it in public because I’m very proud of the work that Tanya Talaga has done — she’s worked really, really hard, and I thought it would be an opportunity for him to just say thank you … It wasn’t received in the way that I had intended it.” She said the government “can’t afford to hit the pause button” on Indigenous issues, and is looking to harness the expertise of MPPs from all parties to work with Indigenous elders and youth to deal with pressing issues. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said he thought the books were “a moving gesture … I didn’t see it as a stunt, to be honest.” He said he has concerns about the government “pausing and cancelling the course (rewriting) around Indigenous issues” as it did in the summer, as well as the decision not to have a stand-alone ministry. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said many items cross the floor, and “the fact that it was rejected could be seen as small-minded.” ",0,"Doug Ford rejects, then accepts, books from Kathleen Wynne on Indigenous issues"
"It is no secret that Patrick Brown and the ruling Ontario Progressive Conservative Party aren’t BFFs. Brown,  , was the party’s leader before stepping down at the end of January amid sexual misconduct allegations from a pair of women. He has denied those allegations and is suing CTV News for defamation over its initial reporting on the story. He was later booted from the PC caucus, essentially ending all affiliations with the party he led only weeks before, and replaced by Doug Ford, who is now premier. “I never got along with the hard-right in my own party. I took positions that you didn’t expect from Progressive Conservatives,” Brown told the Brampton Guardian, listing his participation in Toronto’s Gay Pride Parade, support for climate change action and stance against Islamophobia as driving factors in the falling out. “That certainly made some enemies within the party, but I felt that I was doing what was right for Canada and for Ontario,” he added. Since then, Brown first attempted a political comeback in the race to become the first elected Peel Region chair. That attempt was squashed by the Ford government at the end of July after it cancelled the planned regional chair elections in Peel, York and Muskoka regions just a day before municipal election nominations were set to close. The next day, Brown registered in the Brampton mayor’s race. Rumours of a rift between him and his former party gained traction on the campaign trail after Ford’s campaign manager, Michael Diamond, and two former PC Party presidents endorsed and held a fundraiser for incumbent mayor Linda Jeffrey at the uber-conservative Toronto Albany Club in September. Jeffrey was a longtime political opponent of the PC Party while serving as a Brampton MPP in Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal governments. Brown ended up   to become the city’s next mayor. Social media blew up and continued to fuel speculation Ford and the Ontario government had it out for Brown just a day after election, after the PCs announced they were  , including $90 million for a downtown Ryerson campus in Brampton. While Brown conceded that he has made enemies in the party, he doesn’t believe the decision to scrap the funding was directed at him personally. “I was always a Bill Davis conservative, a red Tory. That might not be the current incarnation of the party. Although, I don’t think (the) announcement with Ryerson had anything to do with personal animosity,” he said. The premier and PC Party also denied any animosity or efforts directed at Brown personally. “Premier Doug Ford is looking forward to working with all newly-elected municipal politicians, including Patrick Brown,” said Simon Jeffries, a spokesperson for the premier’s office “The Ontario PC caucus has an excellent team of MPPs from Brampton and Peel Region who are strong representatives for their constituents, and Premier Doug Ford is proud to fight day-in and day-out for the people of Brampton and the people of Ontario at Queen’s Park,” he added. Brown identified crime and economic development as the two areas he intends to focus on after he officially takes the reins in December. Looking a little further down the road, Brown listed other campaign initiatives such as free transit for seniors and expanding the low-income dental plan for seniors as other files he hopes to tackle during his four-year term.

"Progressive Conservatives have had second thoughts about posting thousands of documents online in their examination of the deficit, fearing commercially sensitive information about Ontario’s energy industry could give some companies an unfair advantage. The reversal took place 24 hours after thousands of pages of  — which is dominated by Progressive Conservative MPPs and is examining Ontario’s deficit — were posted. The documents came from Ontario Power Generation, which is in charge of power production, the Ontario Energy Board, which sets pricing, and the Independent Electricity System Operator, (IESO) which manages the province’s day-to-day power needs. “The damage is done,” said New Democrat MPP Catherine Fife, who was among three NDP members of the committee established by  to warn Monday that some information was commercially sensitive.  Conservative MPP Ross Romano, who had argued on the government’s behalf that all documents supplied by the three bodies should be public, changed course Tuesday with a motion to give them one week to flag which documents should not be made public. His action followed a stern letter from IESO President Peter Gregg expressing “significant concern” at the release, noting the agency did not screen its submissions for confidentiality because there was “no indication” they would be made public. “It is not up to the select committee on financial transparency to determine confidentiality or privilege. It is up to the people who disclose those documents to us. We’re not going to take on their responsibility,” Romano told reporters Tuesday. In the meantime, only MPPs on the committee will be able to access the papers marked “confidential” online but the information is fair game to any corporate spies who downloaded it already, said New Democratic MPP John Vanthof. “Joe Blow might not be interested in those documents but people in the energy sector are extremely interested and they’re watching. As soon as those documents became public, if I was in that sector, I would have jumped on them.” Fife warned the release of information could result in lawsuits against the province, with financial consequences for taxpayers.

"OTTAWA—The chief budget adviser to Ontario’s anti-carbon tax premier once told Canadian senators that putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions is “the single most important thing that any government can do to transition to a low-carbon economy.”  Benjamin Dachis, now Premier Doug Ford’s director of policy, budget and fiscal planning, was supportive of a carbon price when he testified at a Senate committee on Parliament Hill in November 2016. At the time, Dachis was associate director of research at the C.D. Howe Institute, a Toronto-based think tank. “The reason I’m advocating a carbon price is that we, as a society, have made it a clear priority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Dachis   the standing committee on energy, the environment and natural resources. “Once your goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by far the most efficient way to do so is through a price on carbon,” he said. Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party was also in favour of carbon pricing before Patrick Brown resigned as leader and Ford led the party to victory in June’s provincial election. Ford campaigned to cut the cost of gasoline by axing the   introduced by the previous Liberal government in 2016, a promise he kept when he moved to scrap the system in early July.  But unlike Brown, Ford also vowed to fight the federal government’s carbon price plan, which includes a tax on fuel and a   for large industrial emitters. Intent on ensuring each province and territory has a carbon price system in place by 2019, Ottawa   that it will impose its own pricing plan in Ontario over Ford’s resistance. Starting in April, the $20-per-tonne levy will also apply in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick. It will go up $10 each year until it hits $50 per tonne in 2022, when it is expected to increase gasoline costs by 11 cents per litre.  The Trudeau Liberals say carbon pricing is central to their plan to cut emissions that cause climate change, and that all revenue will be returned directly to residents of the provinces where it is being imposed. More than 70 per cent will get more money back than they pay in extra tax, the government says.  Dachis, who now serves as Ford’s budget policy director, did not respond to an interview request Tuesday.  Ford’s spokesperson, Simon Jefferies, said Dachis — who does not advise Ford on environmental issues and is among more than more than three dozen staffers in the premier’s office — was representing the views of the C.D. Howe Institute when he spoke to senators in Ottawa. “He no longer works for or represents the C.D. Howe Institute,” Jefferies said.  Alongside federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and like-minded Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, Ford is now   to Ottawa’s carbon tax. Ford and Scheer have cast doubt on the government’s projection that most people’s rebates will outweigh the cost of the tax, while Ontario and Saskatchewan have gone to court to challenge the federal government’s authority to impose the tax.  “Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax will punish hard-working Ontario families who depend on cars to drive to- and-from work, seniors who depend on affordable natural gas to heat their homes in cold winters, and small businesses who create jobs up and down Main Street Ontario,” said Jefferies.  “If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is insistent on ramming a carbon tax down the throats of Ontario families and job-creators, then Premier Doug Ford and the Ontario Government for the People will use every tool at our disposal to fight this carbon tax in court.” Back in 2016, Dachis told the Senate committee that he believed a carbon price would encourage companies to adopt technologies to lower emissions. He also said a price to discourage emissions would lead to economic benefits of innovation more readily than policies that rely mostly on subsidies to develop new technology, and that such a carbon price wouldn’t destroy the country’s oil and gas industry.  “The bottom line is that Canada can have emissions reductions and jobs in the oil and gas sector, thanks to pipelines and LNG export facilities, as long as we are going to have in place some form of carbon price,” Dachis said.  He’s not the only member of Ford’s team to have previously supported carbon pricing. Attorney General Caroline Mulroney started her failed bid for the PC leadership last winter by supporting Brown’s centrist “People’s Guarantee” platform. That plan, announced in November 2017, would have accepted the federal government’s carbon price and given the province control over its projected revenue in the province, which Ottawa has pegged at about $1.7 billion next year from the fuel charge alone. Brown’s plan would have used that revenue to cut taxes.  The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  on Thanksgiving weekend that called for “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society,” if the world is to avoid the worst extremes of global warming. The report said global emissions will need to drop by 45 per cent below 2010 levels in 2030, and then hit “net zero” by 2050.  Canada’s current target, which government projections say the country is on track to miss, is to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Ottawa’s carbon price plan is expected to cut annual emissions by 50 to 60 megatonnes in 2022, according to federal officials. Canada   in 2016.

"There’s been a political climate change — and Ontario has now officially ended its cap-and-trade alliance with Quebec and California. The Progressive Conservatives on Wednesday made good on their campaign pledge to exit the climate-change pact with the passage of cancellation legislation. “Ontario’s cap-and-trade carbon tax era is officially over,” Environment Minister Rod Phillips told reporters at Queen’s Park after the Tories scrapped the previous Liberal government’s accord. Phillips noted that the province has already lowered gas prices and took aim at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s forthcoming  plan. Because Ontario no longer has its own carbon-pricing scheme, it will be forced into the federal “backstop,” though the province is spending up to $30 million to challenge the constitutionality of that in court. “When the prime minister talks about punishing polluters … he’s really talking about punishing people who drive to work every day. He’s not talking about polluters, he’s talking about commuters,” the minister said. “Clearly, the federal government’s out of touch with the day-to-day reality of Ontarians’ lives. Many of them need their vehicles and pretending they don’t, and pretending everybody can take the subway, is just not going to wash.” The Tories will unveil their own plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions next month.  In the meantime, about $1 billion in cap-and-trade proceeds collected under the Liberal program will go toward winding down energy-conservation programs and other environmental initiatives. Liberal MPP Nathalie Des Rosiers said it was a “sad day for Ontario” that the government voted against Green Leader Mike Schreiner’s motion for an emergency climate-change debate, but voted for a motion from PC MPP Jeremy Roberts — who sported Dracula fangs — to wear costumes in the legislature. “We get a unanimous consent motion to dress up for Halloween, but we can’t get a unanimous consent motion to discuss climate change. To me, that tells it all,” said Des Rosiers (Ottawa-Vanier). “This is the most serious issue of our generation and we have no idea what their plan is and they don’t even want to discuss it,” she said. Schreiner said the Tories just don’t get it. “I call B.S. on the government’s comments that pricing pollution doesn’t work,” the Green leader said. “It’s wrong for this government to play wedge politics with the climate crisis. Our children and grandchildren deserve better.”  NDP MPP Peter Tabuns (Toronto Danforth) said “it’s reckless, it’s immoral” to end initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s going to damage this province and the minister should be embarrassed by what he’s done,” said Tabuns. Under the market-based  , businesses had emission limits — or caps — and those who polluted less could sell — or trade — credits for these to those who emit pollution contributing to climate change. Over time, an industry’s cap is lowered to cut pollution, creating an economic incentive to curb emissions. The program brought in $1.9 billion annually to the treasury with all proceeds going toward environmental initiatives such as retrofitting homes and schools and subsidizing electric cars.

"One of the more despicable themes of Donald Trump’s disgraceful presidency is the constant attack the former reality TV host launches against the mainstream media. Day after day Trump goes after journalists, accusing them of spreading “fake news,” of being “the enemy of the people” and “crooked media.” He has praised a Montana politician who body-slammed a reporter, made fun of a disabled journalist and cheered on supporters who at one rally chanted “Kill them, kill them.” It’s a deliberate strategy to fire up his hard-core supporters, who thrive on hatred, mistrust and bigotry. It’s a tactic that appears to be working, given the resiliency of his base, which hates the mainstream media — except for Fox News — with a passion.    It’s the same strategy Trump uses with his dog-whistle appeals to the far-right and lunatic fringes of America, who hate immigrants, minorities, liberals and Democrats — too often with deadly results. That fury against the media has manifested itself to extremes when a suspected pipe bomb was sent to CNN’s offices in New York City and with the physical and verbal assaults on journalists covering Trump’s rallies. Sadly, the two most powerful Conservative leaders in Canada have decided to mimic the U.S. president by bashing the media, bringing the worst of Trump to this country.  Both Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are suddenly best buddies in their hatred of Justin Trudeau, Liberals and journalists.  Clearly it’s a strategy that plays to their core voters and helps with fundraising, but it ultimately works to undermine our democracy and creates an opening for hatred that too often can spill out into the open, as we have seen happen tragically in recent weeks in the U.S.  Ford has long despised most journalists, except for fawning columnists and editorial writers at the Toronto Sun and National Post. Throughout his political career he has attacked journalists, suggesting many of them are liars, “downtown elitists” or Liberal hacks.  Now Scheer has joined the anti-media gang, telling party loyalists at a recent rally in Ottawa that he will stand up to “the media” and claimed — falsely — that the Tories don’t get same treatment from mainstream media as do the Liberals and Trudeau. At the same time, Tory politicians have been branding some journalists as “Liberal reporters.” It’s nothing new for politicians of all stripes to complain about their press coverage. What is new is the ferocity of today’s attacks and how they feed into the populist rage that has emerged in Canada as well as the U.S.  As we see in the U.S., that rage is aimed at discrediting the media and other institutions that have long been key elements in our democracy.  In a new book released earlier this week, veteran journalist and former   editor Bob Lewis argues that in the age of the tweet and social media, political reporting is more important today than ever.  Lewis says in his book,  , that our democracy depends on the mainstream media presenting context, background and the truth. Despite Trump’s chants of “fake news” and growing criticism here about biased and dishonest journalism, Lewis maintains that the news and media are more honest today than ever before because of the intense scrutiny on everything that is written or broadcast. As Scheer and Ford ratchet up their hate-filled rhetoric against the media, they would be well advised to listen to the words of Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in last weekend’s anti-Semitic shooting spree. Myers urged all politicians to speak responsibly and to end hate-filled speech. Americans “get their instructions from you,” he said on CNN. “When you speak words of hate, you say to them, ‘This is OK, you can do it as well.’” Myers warned of a vicious circle. “Hate promulgating more hate promulgating more hate,” he said. “We need to be better than this, we can be better than this.” Scheer and Ford can indeed be better than this. Hopefully they will be.  ",0,Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford are copying Trump’s playbook
"Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford is urging Canadian voters to topple Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in next year’s federal election. Introducing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer at Queen’s Park as “the next prime minister of Canada,” Ford stepped up his attacks on Trudeau over the Liberals’ plan to put a price on carbon to tackle climate change. “The carbon tax (is) the worst tax ever,” the premier said Tuesday. “There’s only one way — one way — we’re going to get rid of the carbon tax and that is by getting rid of Justin Trudeau,” said Ford, who will spend up to $30 million on a legal challenge of the federal measure. Ontario’s premier is still   from Trudeau’s decision to unveil the Liberal climate plan last week in Ford’s home riding of Etobicoke North, held federally by Science Minister Kirsty Duncan since 2008. “Get rid of Justin Trudeau, you’re going to have more money in your pocket. Businesses are going to be able to thrive,” he said. Ford’s shot at the prime minister echoes the fractious relationship his predecessor, former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne, had with former Tory prime minister Stephen Harper. Wynne campaigned against Harper in her successful 2014 provincial election and again in Trudeau’s 2015 federal victory. Scheer, who said he has “always believed climate change is real” and is affected by human behaviour, welcomed Ford into the fray as the two Tory chiefs do battle against Trudeau’s scheme. “It’s wonderful all the new voices that are coming out to fight this carbon tax,” said the federal leader, who has yet to unveil his party’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Asked if he felt in any way threatened by Ford’s apparent national political ambitions, Scheer said: “Not at all.” “There’s great co-operation between provincial and federal parties when we have interests and common ground,” he said. In Ottawa, Intergovernmental Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Scheer was “at Queen’s Park today getting his marching orders from Doug Ford on Stephen Harper’s failed plan to deal with climate change.” “Canadians expect their governments to take action to combat climate change and that is exactly what we are doing,” said LeBlanc. “Putting a price on pollution is good for the economy and good for the environment, which means that it’s good for the middle class.” ",0,Ford says voters should ‘get rid of Justin Trudeau’ next year
"Premier Doug Ford maintains Ontario has a $15 billion provincial deficit and darkly warns that his Progressive Conservatives inherited a fiscal mess from the previous Liberal government. But a closer look at the books suggests the shortfall should be significantly lower when Finance Minister Vic Fedeli releases the fall economic statement next month. Under questioning about the Tories’ accounting on Tuesday from interim Liberal leader John Fraser, Ford blew a gasket. “It pretty rich that this member was part of the $15-billion deficit that has been put on the backs of businesses and put on the backs of the people here in Ontario,” the premier thundered. “The member from Ottawa South was personally responsible for destroying the financial books of this province. He destroyed 300,000 families that lost their jobs under the Liberal government,” he said. According to Statistics Canada, Ontario unemployment hovers at the lowest rate it’s been in a generation and employment has increased by 1.1 per cent, or 79,000 jobs, since August 2017. “There was no oversight for 15 years for the taxpayers. We have an inquiry going on. We have a select committee going on to find out who got rich off … the Liberal government,” added Ford. In fact, there is considerable scrutiny of the province’s books — both the  and the financial accountability   released pre-election reports prior to the  . Former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne’s government forecast a $6.7 billion deficit for 2018-19. Wynne’s tally included $5.7 billion in new Liberal election spending announced in the  . While the Tories are not bound by those promises — and have already begun cancelling them, including $307.3 million for new satellite university campuses in Brampton, Markham, and Milton — they include them in their $15-billion deficit figure. Further complicating matters, Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk, who was involved in an accounting dispute with the previous Liberal regime, said this year’s shortfall is $11.7 billion. That’s $5 billion higher than the Liberal deficit — and $3.3 billion lower than the Tories’ $15 billion tally. The disagreement stems from whether $11 billion of the government’s share of co-sponsored Ontario Public Service Employees’ Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan can be counted toward the bottom line. Even though Lysyk and her predecessors booked the holdings as an asset starting in 2002, she changed her mind two years ago.  A panel of independent experts hired by the previous government and led by the chair of the Canadian Actuarial Standards Oversight Council concluded last year she was wrong. Even Ford’s independent “financial commission of inquiry,” headed by former B.C. Liberal premier Gordon Campbell, said the government should only adopt Lysyk’s accounting method on a “provisional basis” while negotiating with her. “It would seem reasonable that the government should be able to recognize a portion of an asset it jointly controls with another party,” Campbell’s report concluded. “Given the risks and uncertainties involved, they may not feel it appropriate for the government to recognize its full 50 per cent share of the surplus. By the same token, however, it seems unlikely they would conclude the value to be zero.” Fraser noted the Tories are “cutting the programs and not reflecting that in the public accounts.” “They’re also not reflecting that they’re going to negotiate the pension treatment in the public accounts.”  Treasury Board President Peter Bethlenfalvy and the PC MPP for Pickering — Uxbridge, said regardless of the accounting treatment there are challenges ahead for the new government as it strives to “repair the damage to both the public finances and the public trust caused by Liberal mismanagement.” “We will be cutting red tape, we will be cutting inefficiencies and we will be cutting the deficit,” said Bethlenfalvy.

"A Liberal MPP is hoping the new Progressive Conservative government will act where her Liberals fell short by amending the Juries Act to allow greater participation by Indigenous people. Nathalie Des Rosiers on Thursday tabled private member’s legislation that would enact a key recommendation of former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci 2013 report on the lack of First Nations representation in jury trials and inquests. While the previous Liberal government commissioned the Iacabucci review in 2011 and acted upon some of his 17 recommendations, a key one remains unfulfilled. Des Rosiers wants to change Juries Act provisions that prevent those who have been convicted of minor criminal offences from serving as jurors. The Ottawa-Vanier MPP, a law school dean and former minister in the previous Liberal government until June, said it’s time to “eliminate criteria that would systematically, sometimes unwittingly, exclude” people from participating. “The impartiality and the representativeness of a jury is essential for it to perform the task that it does play in our justice system,” said Des Rosiers. “It is not because potential jurors have been convicted of anything that they are necessarily unable to carefully listen to the evidence, assess facts, and be impartial,” she said. “We should know that 25 per cent of Canadians have a criminal record — not all of them for an indictable offence — but nonetheless ... the restrictions that we have now eliminate too many people from too many groups from the list of juries.” Her bill is modelled on Saskatchewan legislation that states only residents who are “legally confined to an institution” are ineligible for jury duty. “This Saskatchewan model is a better and fairer solution.” Attorney General Caroline Mulroney dodged reporters and was not available to comment on whether the new government would consider Des Rosiers’ proposal.  In 2013, Iacobucci found “systemic racism” in the courts, prison, and jury process. He urged the provincial government of the day to implement all his recommendations, warning the problem “warrants urgent response.” His probe was sparked after an inquest into the 2007 drowning of high school student Reggie Bushie in 2007 came to a halt in 2011. Bushie’s death — and similar tragedies involving six other students who had left remote northern reserves attend high school in Thunder Bay — was the subject of Star reporter Tanya Talaga’s bestseller,  .

"FREDERICTON—Five weeks after taking second place in the provincial election, New Brunswick’s Liberal government has fallen after losing a confidence vote on its throne speech. Premier Brian Gallant told the legislature Friday he would be going to see Lt.-Gov. Jocelyne Roy Vienneau to resign as premier. “And I will humbly suggest to her honour to allow the leader of the Conservative party to attempt to form a government and gain the confidence of the house,” he said He wished the Tories luck, saying: “Their success will be New Brunswick’s success.” The Liberals won just 21 seats in the September election — one fewer than the Tories — while the Greens and People’s Alliance each won three seats. Gallant sought to survive with a minority government by adding many of the opposition’s campaign promises to his party’s throne speech earlier this week, but his party’s fate was sealed Thursday when both the Tories and People’s Alliance said they’d vote to defeat it. Progressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs said he wants the transition to occur as quickly as possible and will present a throne speech before the end of the month. “The throne speech won’t be a shopping list. It will be a priority list and it will be focused on some big items we can agree on,” he said after the vote. “We will set lofty goals and achieve them. We don’t need more taxes, we need results.” Higgs — who was to make his own visit to the lieutenant-governor Friday afternoon — said he believes his minority government can survive four years by producing results. Its success will depend on support from the opposition parties. People’s Alliance Leader Kris Austin said his party has agreed to support the Tories during confidence votes for at least 18 months to provide some stability to the legislature. “We are in nobody’s back pocket, but in a minority government you do have to work together and we’ve agreed to do that with Mr. Higgs,” Austin said. However, he said his members will be free to vote their conscience on bills. Austin said his first priority is to get the new Tory government to address a shortage of paramedics responsible for a reduction in ambulance services. Green Leader David Coon and his two members voted to support the Liberal throne speech, which included many of his party’s campaign promises. “Our message to the Conservatives is that it’s important that they include those things in their throne speech, and we’ll be working hard to make sure that happens,” Coon said. Prior to the vote, Gallant made a final pitch for support with an address closing debate on the throne speech. He said New Brunswickers voted for change in how political parties govern and he takes full responsibility for the election results. Gallant acknowledged the weeks since the deadlocked election had been “challenging,” but said voters called for a change on how parties govern. He called for an “agenda of collaboration” no matter which party governed, and admitted he had sometimes fallen into the old partisan ways as premier. He said it appeared the election results — which saw the Liberals dominate the largely francophone north and the Tories and right-of-centre People’s Alliance do better in the mostly anglophone south — suggested the province is divided along regional and linguistic lines. But he said people should not be taken in by those apparent divisions. “What binds us together is greater than what drives us apart ... We’re all New Brunswickers.” ",0,New Brunswick’s Tories poised for power after Liberal government falls
"OTTAWA—Statistics Canada has asked the federal privacy watchdog to review a new research project that would analyze the private banking information of 500,000 Canadians. Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien’s office said Wednesday that Statistics Canada asked them to perform a “deep dive” on the project, first revealed by  . Therrien’s office said it had   about the project after media reports began to surface. “The commissioner’s office will be seeking details regarding the information requests the agency has made to various industry sectors,” a statement posted by the privacy watchdog read. “The commissioner’s office has a legal obligation to investigate complaints fairly and impartially under the law … Therefore, no additional details can be provided at this time.” StatsCan was seeking “individual-level financial transaction data” of 500,000 Canadians from banks for a pilot research project. The agency told Global News that the data would be anonymized once obtained from banks — meaning StatsCan staffers couldn’t look up where individual Canadians spend their money. It’s not clear how the Canadians would be chosen. Canada’s chief statistician, Anil Arora, said the agency needs the data to measure Canada’s economy and Canadians’ financial habits. Traditional research methods, the agency argued, aren’t keeping up with societal change. The agency’s explanations haven’t flown in the House of Commons, where the opposition Conservatives have been demanding answers on why StatsCan needs the personal banking information of thousands of Canadians. “(This) is about the fundamental right for Canadians to have their personal financial information protected,” said Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer during question period Wednesday. “It’s about whether or not this government thinks it has a right to peer into individuals’ bank accounts to access line-by-line transactions. Will (Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) do the right thing, and tell his government department to stop accessing Canadians private information?” For a second day, Trudeau defended the StatsCan project, saying they’re ensuring Canadians privacy rights will be respected. “Statistics Canada will use anonymized data for statistical purposes only,” Trudeau told the Commons. “No personal information will be made public. Statistics Canada is engaged with the privacy commissioner’s office on this project, and is working with them to ensure Canadians’ banking information remains protected and private.” ",0,"Privacy watchdog to investigate StatsCan research into the banking habits of 500,000 Canadians"
"Welfare reforms coming soon from Premier Doug Ford’s government will put more emphasis on helping recipients find jobs, Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod says. But she ruled out a return to “workfare” programs like the ones implemented by the former Progressive Conservative government under premier Mike Harris in the late 1990s, saying that is “not at all” on the agenda. The cost to taxpayers of providing social assistance is getting too high and will keep rising unless a new approach is taken, MacLeod signalled Wednesday. “The program is almost $10 billion and it’s set to continue. It’s not working. It’s been disjointed. It’s been patchwork,” she told reporters after a  suggested food bank use is up 14 per cent since 2008, with heavier use in inner suburbs like Etobicoke. MacLeod said people on Ontario Works and the Ontario Disability Support Program should not be afraid of the overhaul to the welfare system. “They have to understand my motivation is very clear on this, that we want to lift people up and give them the best possible outcomes…if they can work, we want to make sure we have front-line staff supporting them in that endeavour. If they can’t work we want to make sure they have broader supports in place to protect them.” Under workfare, able-bodied recipients of welfare had to participate in either training or job placements. MacLeod did not provide details of the new program, which has been developed as the government prepares to cut a promised $6 billion in annual spending by finding what Ford calls “efficiencies.” “It’s really important that we look at the whole person and really help them and support them getting back on track.” Opposition parties expressed skepticism, saying a government that has frozen the minimum wage at $14 hourly — blocking a rise to $15 in January — is clawing back two paid sick days from workers,  is not likely to be a friend of people on welfare. “It’s hard to be hopeful,” said interim Liberal leader John Fraser, who was part of Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government that raised the minimum wage and welfare rates. “Where are the $6 billion in savings coming from?” Fraser asked. “It’s an easy target…the people who are the most vulnerable.” MacLeod promised an overhaul of the welfare system during the summer, saying the government needs to make it more “sustainable” and branding the basic income pilot program a “disincentive” for people to find jobs. “When you’re encouraging people to accept money without strings attached, it really doesn’t send a message that our ministry and our government want to send,” she told reporters in early August. Ontario’s pilot project provided 4,000 low-income residents in Hamilton-Brantford, Thunder Bay and Lindsay with a steady income of $16,989, and up to $24,027 for couples, while researchers looked at how it affected their lives.

"PITTSBURGH—Hockey players know they’re playing a game. And they know they’re playing for their community. The Maple Leafs and Pittsburgh Penguins know sometimes, unfortunately, the game needs to take a back seat when tragedy strikes the community. Toronto experienced it last April during the Leafs-Bruins playoffs, when a man drove a van   in North York, killing 10 people and injuring 16 others; and experienced further tragedy this summer when a gunman   killed two and injured 13. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, experienced it this week, when a gunman   at the Tree of Life Synagogue. In both cities, the major sports organizations did their best to help their communities heal. “Tragedies, like what happened in Pittsburgh and what happened in Toronto, nothing is going to make it better,” said Leafs forward Zach Hyman. “Sports gets intertwined with the community. It’s important to show our support. “When things like that happen to the city, you’re affected, the team is affected. It’s important to be together.” It’s probably never enough, but sports teams can help contribute to the recovery of the shaken citizenry. “If you spend enough time here, and you know Pittsburgh, you’ll know people have a lot of pride here. They’re great people,” said Penguins captain Sidney Crosby. “They care about one another. When something like that happens, it’s natural for people to want to help and come together. “It’s a pretty close-knit community.” The Penguins jumped into action this week. “It’s our home, too. We all live here, too. Nobody wants to see that stuff happen, especially in a place you call home,” said Penguins defenceman Jack Johnson. “It was a sad day for everyone. Human nature is to bond together. “There’s nothing you can do to rectify the situation, but you’re doing all you can to help heal.” The tragedies struck close to home for Hyman. He saw his hometown attacked twice, and his religion targeted in Pittsburgh. “Things like this need to stop,” said Hyman. “It’s disturbing, for sure. It hits hard. It’s terrible. But the community is strong and banding together. There was a rally in Toronto in Mel Lastman Square, where thousands came out to show their support.” Moments of silence were held in Pittsburgh and around the league following the Tree of Life tragedy. These pauses have become all too common, with tragedies striking with alarming regularity in places like Las Vegas and Boston as well in recent years. When tragedy strikes, the best organizations adapt. The Penguins cancelled their team Hallowe’en party. Two officers wounded in the synagogue shooting did a ceremonial faceoff against the Islanders on Tuesday. Three representatives of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh were invited as well, and were able to talk to Crosby and owner Mario Lemieux for 45 minutes after the game. The Vegas Golden Knights cancelled their opening-night celebrations last season when a gunman killed 58 and injured more than 800 before the puck dropped on the team’s first home game. The Knights’ response endeared the expansion team to the community and some credit the Knights for helping Las Vegas heal; the team’s handling of the tragedy helped it forge an identity and bond with the city. But the games still need to be played, even if a pall is cast over a city. “It’s tough, but you provide an outlet for people to maybe get away from the tragedy for a few hours, and enjoy a hockey game,” said Hyman. “Obviously, there are bigger things in life.” Besides condolences and memorializing the victims of the Toronto van attack, the Leafs and Raptors have beefed up security in and around Scotiabank Arena in an attempt to make gathering crowds feel more secure. The Leafs and Raptors contributed to the #TorontoStrong foundation that aided victims and their families, and encouraged fans to do the same. “The Leafs are a huge part of Toronto, the Penguins are huge in Pittsburgh,” said Leafs coach Mike Babcock. “It’s a way to feel good. That’s what sports are for. Those of us blessed to be part of it have an obligation to do things right and help uplift the city.” ",0,Penguins rally around Pittsburgh in wake of synagogue shooting
"Jason Spezza didn’t get to 1,000 NHL games simply based on skill. Ron Hainsey didn’t get there simply based on grit. And as 26-year-old Justin Holl got into his third career NHL game — the defenceman’s first of the season — the lesson to longevity is adaptability. “There’s no real secret, you just have to put the work in,” said the Dallas Stars’ Spezza as he prepared to play career game 1,001 on Thursday night against the   at Scotiabank Arena.  “There are going to be good times and bad times in your career. You just have to find a way to work your way through it.” Spezza was an elite offensive talent when the Ottawa Senators drafted him second overall in the 2001 draft and was a point-a-game player for most of his time in Ottawa. As he’s aged — he’s 35 now — his roles have changed, at times used as a checking centre in Dallas, and now back to some power play time under new coach Jim Montgomery. “You change your game, you just have to figure out where the game is going, to what is in-trend, to what coaches are looking for, and adapt,” said Spezza. “There have definitely been different periods of adapting for me. “I work on my skating and work on my puck possession time more than I ever have. Handling pucks in corners. I think if was this good at it as when I was in my prime, I would have been real dangerous. I wish somebody would have told me to work on these things.” Spezza played half a season in the minors before making the NHL more or less for good, though he spent another full season in the minors due to the 2004-05 lockout. Hainsey, whose 1,000th game was Thursday night, had a tougher career path. A first-round pick by the Montreal Canadiens in 2000, Hainsey spent the better part of five seasons in the minors until making it for good in 2005-06 with Columbus. “Five years in the minors and 15 years in the NHL — we all get in a big hurry to get there, the idea is to get there when you’re ready and play as long as you can,” said Leafs coach Mike Babcock. “Ron is a great example to our young guys who are dying for an opportunity.” Hainsey is an example for Holl, who at 26 made an NHL team out of training camp for the first time. Thursday’s game against Dallas was his first of the season, having sat the first 12 games as a healthy scratch. Given he started out in the ECHL five years ago — after four years of college — his stretch in the press box was a breeze by comparison. “I’ve got through way more difficult things,” said Holl. “I played (in the ECHL) for a year. You know what they say about that, easy to come, hard to leave. That’s the league. Getting to this level, making it to the NHL is a big hurdle. “I’m not comfortable just being here. But being here was a step. Then the next step is finding a way to play every day.” Spezza says he has some wonderful memories over his career, perhaps capped by the Senators’ 2007 Stanley Cup final appearance. “Those teams we had in Ottawa in the mid-2000s, where we were winning every night, went to the finals,” said Spezza. “We had some teams every night we went into building expecting to thump someone. It’s kind of nice being the team that had that feeling all the time. That was the most fun I’ve had over a couple-of-years period.” Last year was probably his lowest point, with just eight goals and 18 assists in 78 games; he was in then-coach Ken Hitchcock’s doghouse. “I’ve been able to maintain good numbers my whole career, and that’s because I’ve been able to adapt. Last year I had a s—ty year, but this year I’m in a role I’m more comfortable with. But you have to work at it. You have to figure out ways to contribute, figure out what your role on the team is, and then get good at it.” ",0,Dallas Stars’ Jason Spezza prime example of adaptability

"Like every game, there were a lot of scouts and executives from other teams at the   Thursday night. At a break, they were talking about depth and how no team has any anymore at least — as one said -- “once the big names get their money.” The   strength was supposed to be their depth. But really, they don’t have any. And – outside of John Tavares – the big names haven’t got their money. Without Auston Matthews (left shoulder injury) and William Nylander (contract impasse), the Leafs are not the scary offensive force they were imagined to be. Mitch Marner is always dangerous. Tavares is always a threat. Nazem Kadri can play top six on any team. And then? Well, the balance just isn’t there. Kasperi Kapanen is inconsistent. The rest of the forwards have been largely no-shows offensively. A healthy Matthews changes everything, as does a signed Nylander. With them, yes, the Leafs are better. But right now, neither are playing. Are the Leafs at risk of losing or wasting this season? A year in which they could make some noise with so many young stars on entry level deals. If the Leafs don’t have depth now, they’ll arguably have less once Nylander, Matthews and Marner get their big contracts. Matthews will be back. Presumably Nylander as well. The risk without them at the moment is the Leafs will be squandering the next month, maybe falling back. Instead of challenging for first place in the Atlantic – getting much-needed home-ice advantage — they’ll be in with the pack. Who thought the Montreal Canadiens and Buffalo Sabres would be in the mix like they are? Just shows you there are sure things in the NHL. November is a telling month.

Going to keep this question fun. If you were at a camp fire and could hang out and have a couple of beers with one current Leaf player, one retired player that is alive today and was a Leaf, and one deceased player that was a Leaf, who would they be and why? Justin P ANSWER: Interesting take. Well, I’d want good storytellers. Ron Hainsey doesn’t love talking to the media, but he’s an interesting guy with an interesting take who’s been around and seen a lot. So him from the current team. Maybe he’d tell a few Atlanta Thrashers stories. Wendel Clark can also chat things up pretty good, so he’s my retired Leaf. Some farm stories. And let’s go with the late-great Johnny Bower, just so he can tell stories about playing for the Rhode Island Reds and babysitting Lou Lamoriello.  Hi Kevin. Is Josh Leivo a bust? How much longer do we have to wait for this guy to break through? He really has shown very little since becoming a regular. Your comments, please. Dan W. ANSWER: It’s a little early to give up on Josh Leivo. There are a lot of guys in the bottom-six not producing. Hello Andreas Johnsson. Hello Tyler Ennis. Hello Connor Brown. Hello Frederik Gauthier. Hello Par Lindholm. Four goals among them. I suspect once one begins to roll, so will others. I expect Johnsson and Brown to lead their lines with the energy both have. I know Dan your question was asked prior to the Leafs-Stars game. I thought Leivo had a good effort Thursday night.    Hey Uncle Kev, No Nylander question from me this week……we all know there are no answers to that yet… Question is though, after seeing another trap team, the Flames, stifle the vaunted Leaf offensive juggernaut on Monday….What exactly is the best way to beat the trap…? Stretch pass to get it into the opposing end and break up the trap before it can get set? You can’t likely carry it in and not sure that you could given the forecheck that is part of the trap … Obviously, key is to get the first goal so the opposing team can’t get into the trap and wait mode. Just wonder what the Leafs can do, that they do well, to counter the dreaded trap … I know they do the stretch well, but can they do it well enough and often enough to get that all important first goal? As always, can’t wait to see your answer…look forward to your mailbag every Friday…. As one reader noted already, the only reason I’m a subscriber to the Star…. John L in Kingston ANSWER: Thank you for the subscription and that’s high praise about this Mailbag. You guys — readers and contributors — are the best. It makes my week. The stretch pass is the Leafs go-to move that other teams have figured out. The Leafs need to adapt. One way is by carrying the puck. Unfortunately, two of their best zone-entry and exit guys are out: Auston Matthews and William Nylander. Funny how questions that have nothing to do with Nylander sometimes ending up being about Nylander. Without him, they are less dangerous. Nylander is elite at controlling the puck and entering the offensive zone. Dump-and-chase hockey is not effective anymore. Sometimes, that’s what the Leafs are left with.  Hey Kevin, what’s your thoughts on this scenario: Given that it’ll take $13M, conservatively, to keep both Nylander and Gardiner past this year, what could we get if they were packaged in a trade? I don’t want to trade either; I am definitely not in the “trade Gardiner” crowd because I watch the games closely enough to notice all the times he nonchalantly skates the puck out of trouble from the Leafs’ zone, and not only his occasional glaring giveaways. But with the current holdout situation and upcoming cap crunch, even getting a Drew Doughty in return (not saying he’s available or even the right choice), at $11M would represent at least a $2M savings from the above. Given the rather modest return Erik Karlsson fetched Ottawa, who do you figure we could get — could we dream of prying away, say, a PK Subban? Now that would be something. Cheers, Godwin L ANSWER: An interesting thought. Certainly Nylander and Gardiner – on talent alone — should fetch a lot. But remember, neither are under contract and Nylander now looks like trouble to some teams. The Sharks traded for one year of Karlsson. He’s unrestricted on July 1. So the number of years and average annual value of a contract factors into a trade. So would Nashville give up three-and-a-half years of Subban for a half-a-year of Gardiner and an unsigned winger who values himself more than where the league sees him? Does Nashville even want to upset their apple cart? All that said, I’m not sure Mike Babcock is the biggest fan of Subban’s style of play, so there might not be a fit there. If they’re traded, I doubt Gardiner and Nylander go the same direction. Gardiner fits on a team that wants to win now: Boston, Washington, Pittsburgh (and Nashville). Nylander would be prized by a team looking to rebuild, like Detroit or Vancouver, or one on the rise, like Edmonton or Arizona.  Hi Kevin  Really enjoy your work.  I’m wondering about the Nylander stalemate. Given the Leafs have two of the most successful corporations as owners couldn’t MLSE leverage that in the contract negotiations? Maybe sign Willy for $6M per year then have Rogers and / or Bell sign him to a personal contract for $1M each to cover the remaining gap? Try to use the large corporate backing to their advantage. Thanks.  Regards, John B ANSWER: Thanks John. I’ll give you credit for being creative, but what you’re suggesting sounds like salary-cap circumvention and in violation of Article 26 of the collective bargaining agreement. Gary Bettman would shut it down in a nanosecond. Because once one player gets it, another 700 across the league will want it the next time their contracts come due. Article 26 is as wordy and clunky as you would imagine. But here is the most direct passage I can find related to your question: “A Player or Player Actor may not receive, directly or indirectly, anything of value from a Club or Club Actor other than his Player Salary and Bonuses set forth in, and in accordance with the terms of, his SPC (standard player contract), and his share of Benefits and Government Mandates/Other Programs as set forth in this Agreement or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. ... For example, a Player is prohibited from entering into an agreement with a broadcasting company that is a Club Affiliated Entity, in which the Player agrees to host a weekly television show.” That said, players are free to pursue other sponsors. Auston Matthews and P.K. Subban have deals with Scotiabank, for example.  Hey uncle Kevin,  I have to say you know your stuff, and how you respond so politely to some of these question is beyond me.  I too really look forward to reading the Mailbag Friday, so much Leafs material I read and this is by far my fav. My question is about Freddy Gauthier aka the Goat, I don’t see how most of us hardcore Bud fans are so hard on him. Sure he could sneak a few in every now and then, but did he not put pressure on the Jets D this past Wednesday when Josh fanned on the point shot and Ennis tipped it in? He’s a big body 6 ‘5 all day long as Babs likes to say haha, but I’m down with the Goat and to me it’s one less thing to work on come trade deadline. (See Boyle and Mr. Turtleneck).  Also agree on Hyman he does look faster and could play on either of our top lines.  Just curious what you think?  Anyway die hard fan from NL looking forward to seeing the byes as we call them next year in St. John’s. I have fond memories of watching the Baby Leafs in the old memorial stadium in St. John’s with my late grandfather. Crawford coaching and the Cat in goal loves it!  Who knows maybe this is our year!! Again thanks for the time you take to chat with us die hards. Enjoy your week and please God let Nylander be signed before the next mail bag.  Thanks  Brad P ANSWER: I’ve always like Gauthier personally. To me, he is a prototypical NHLer for the mid-2000s, a big hulking shutdown centre. If he makes it in today’s game, he’ll deserve all the credit. To Babcock’s credit, he plays Gauthier to his strengths. The Leafs are not asking Gauthier to score, only not to get scored against. If he keeps his minus low, he has a chance. As of the moment, Gauthier is plus-2. He’s also plus-18 on the shot-attempts ledger — on the ice for 18 more shot attempts for than against. That’s fifth best on the team, or about 58 per cent possession/Corsi. Pretty good for a guy that hardly ever gets any offensive zone faceoffs, starting more than 60 per cent of the time in the neutral or defensive zone. That means he’s gaining the offensive zone an awful lot. Too bad he can’t score. : I wish the Leafs would get rid of Gardiner. I've asked a lot of people who watch hockey and they agree with me. In my opinion, he's not a good defenceman. Actually he is not a defenceman. When the opposition scores, I always ask myself where he is after the puck goes in, and quite often he's there not in position, but usually is behind the person or out of position. He can't/doesn't back check. He can't/doesn't finish a check. He doesn't body check. He doesn't physically clear a player anyone from the front of the net. He quite often gives the puck away. He lets the puck get by him at the opposition'blue line. He quite often passes the puck to the opposition without looking. It is true he scores goals, but his play in the Leaf end is terrible and more goals in the Leaf are the result by his play. Once the puck is dropped, He should only play in opposing end and not be allowed in the Leafs end. I see by your Star Article on Saturday, October 27, there may be a chance I get my wish. Sorry to be so drab, what do you think? Peter S. ANSWER: I think my week wouldn’t be complete without someone crapping all over Gardiner. ... You should know that hardly anybody finishes checks anymore. Coaches discourage that. It takes the checker out of the game. He gives the puck away far less than you think. He has it a lot. Way more than most. That’s a skill. Sometimes it doesn’t go the way he wants. Most of the time, it does. You’ve got blinders on. I’ll agree he’s better in the offensive zone than defensive zone. But as coach Mike Babcock says, why would he want any of his players to play in the defensive zone. Get it out and stay up the other end. Gardiner does that. : Hey Kevin, The Nylander issue got me thinking — maybe a little too much. But here goes. Has any detailed research has been done into when teams typically ""age out"" of contention (the core gets too old to win, despite supporting cast and an edge in experience), and conversely, when teams typically ""age into"" contention (core hits its prime for a period of years and acquires the necessary experience to win)? If that research has been done, I'll bet Dubas is all over it. The key would be how many true difference makers are needed to win and their respective ages. It's hard to imagine the Leafs beating the Pens, Caps, Lightning or Bruins in a playoff series today. But all of those teams have an older core, correct? What about in two, three or four years? At that point, the Leafs core group is in its prime (if you can keep it healthy and together in a cap world), while several current contenders should begin fading. Other teams like the Canes might be the new nemesis. Which brings me to Nylander. If Dubas has decided Willie is one of the team's key difference makers for years to come, I suspect he's prepared to let the Dec. 1 deadline pass rather than trade him for a non-difference maker, or sign him for a number that costs you another difference maker on your roster. It's not just about this season -- Dubas obviously has to look at a longer horizon. And he probably envisions Matthews/Nylander; Tavares/Marner; Kadri/Kapanen as a Cup winning formula ... eventually ... IF he can do something about that defence. It'll be increasingly difficult to acquire those difference makers going forward, as the Leafs will likely be drafting later. So they absolutely have to hang onto the ones they've got unless the perfect trade pops up. At the same time, Dubas will set a clear precedent in his first major negotiation. Bottom line - I hope Willie isn't sitting around expecting Dubas to cave as Dec. 1 draws near. And I hope he likes it in Toronto because that's where he'll be playing for the next several years if he's seen as a key piece of the puzzle. Your thoughts? Dave in Kelowna ANSWER: Insightful points, Dave. Guys that make a difference are hard to find. If you don’t have them, you have to trade for them, draft them or sign them as unrestricted free agents. The Leafs have chosen to draft, with the notable exception of John Tavares. Can they keep all their difference-makers? I’m starting to doubt it. : Hi Kevin. For the last (almost) three seasons my son played with Igor (and Nik Z. and Radulov and Kiselevic) on CSKA (KHL) in Moscow. Quite an organization. I think next season the hype will start for Kirill Kaprisov. He’s that good.  Actually I was talking with my son   today in Russia (Yekaterinburg ) about Igor’s play with the Leafs. We knew he was coming to the Leafs so, towards the end of last season I paid closer attention to him. So Geoff asked me how Igor was playing. Clearly the Leafs have committed to him and want a big right shot defence. I knew he would struggle because his skating is adequate not elite like Zaitzev’s. Igor is clearly a project, he was a second or even a third pairing in CSKA . I hope he gets better and the Leafs are patient. I wonder if Igor would even be in the lineup if not for injuries.  Everything Igor said about the old CSKA arena is true. Hard to believe. But they have a new one which I haven’t seen. Actually my son now plays for Jokerit in Helsinki which is a much larger and newer rink. He ran into a few Winnipeg players yesterday in Helsinki. Small world. Good article. Thought you’d like to know.  Norm Platt. RESPONSE: Response. I hope your son is having the experience he wants. I think playing hockey in Europe or Russia in your 20s (or at 33, in Geoff’s case) has to be a lot of fun, and a great way to see the world for a Canadian. : Greetings Kevin, So as I readily admit I can be slow sometimes putting the obvious together. Hockey under the Shanaplan has been different, marketed differently and it would seem that there is far less of ""this is the way we've always done it"" thinking that is being applied to the entity that is the Toronto Maple Leafs. A secondary factor into the perspective that some take involves the amount of time (years, decades) that they have been following the Buds and perhaps while also pursuing their own on-ice dreams forming opinions as to where all this is going. Being solidly north of 50 myself I have spent a lot of time in and around the game, forming my own share of opinions in that time. I, as have many, many others, have been dreaming of the day that fortune smiles on the team and perchance Lord Stanley's cup returns to Hogtown. I have always had a latent mistrust for the supremely talented among us, for no other reason than it has been my experience for those that a skill comes easily to are rarely ever put into a situation where they are tested past their attained skill level. For all the rest of us who scuffle along we have to search out every advantage to succeed and we also understand the need for perseverance, the taste of bitter defeat can be a powerful motivator, at least to those who don't give up. To get to my point, I am now of the opinion that a significant number of fans have come to associate ""old time hockey"" with passionate determination to win at any cost and this becomes their measuring stick for what we watch today. I would guess that a large number of people that have a long history with the game are suspicious that our local lads are prone to playing too cutely and will fold (again) when the games once again mean something-the playoffs. I take the Tavares signing as indication that the Leaf brain-trust still seems to value heart, to use a term, and hopefully this signing will pay dividends when the stakes are high and the going is really tough. Do you believe that the Leafs' have the necessary determination and tenacity to be successful this year, or are we still too early in a process? Thanks for what you do, Doug from B-ford ANSWER: These Leafs don’t lack for heart. You’re right about Tavares. Ditto for Marleau. But the entire leadership group: Matthews, Marner, Rielly, Kadri and Andersen all have heart. ",0,MAILBAG: What's wrong with the Maple Leafs?

"It’s amazing what a government that styles itself as being “for the people” can accomplish in a few short months to make life just a bit more miserable for so many people struggling to make it in this province.  In August the Ford government cut a planned 3 per cent increase in social assistance payments in half and scrapped the basic income pilot project launched by the Liberals.  As it turns out, that was just the warm-up.  Now, with what it calls the Ontario Open for Business Act, the government has made it clear that the “people” it speaks for do not include those at the bottom of the heap who have been struggling for a share of the province’s growing prosperity.  In reality, it will do just the opposite by clawing back planned wage increases, rights and protections contained in the former Liberal government’s Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, passed late last year. That certainly isn’t good for employees, and as many economists have argued it isn’t good for the economy as a whole either. Some of the changes come as no surprise. Labour Minister Laurie Scott, for example, had already made it clear that the minimum wage would not rise from $14 an hour to $15 in January, as it was set to do under the Liberals’ legislation. But the new law goes a bit further than just cancelling the scheduled increase, which will deprive a person on minimum wage of about $2,000 a year. It actually freezes the provincial minimum wage at $14 until October 2020, instead of planning for it to rise with inflation. Starting in 2020, the wage will start to increase gradually, but it isn’t expected to reach $15 until January 2024 — a full five years after the current plan. That leaves tens of thousands of low-wage workers further behind. And it ignores numerous studies that suggest providing workers with a decent wage puts more money into the economy, which in the long term benefits everyone. Nor did a higher minimum wage destroy jobs overall. In fact, Ontario’s unemployment rate hit an 18-year low in July, dipping to 5.4 per cent six months after the last increase. The economy was clearly strong enough to absorb a higher wage for those at the bottom. At the same time, higher minimum wages across Canada have helped to close the dangerous equality gap. A new assessment from the federal Parliamentary Budget Office this week concluded that increases in minimum wages have “contributed significantly” to narrowing the wage gap. That’s a huge social benefit. The Conservative government’s new legislation contains other stings for low-paid workers, as well. It takes away the current two paid sick days employees were eligible for under the previous law, and even reduces the number of unpaid days they can access from 10 to eight.  That will simply encourage sick people to go to work, where they’re likely to infect others, reducing productivity and adding to health care costs if they end up in hospital.  Further, the new legislation also repeals the equal pay for equal work regulations, which required that casual and part-time workers doing the same work as full-time employees receive the same hourly wage. That will encourage employers to hire more people as temporary help and reduce the incentive to hire full-time.  The Ford government is justifying all this on the grounds that it’s necessary to cut “red tape that is driving jobs and investment out of our province.”  Falling unemployment and an influx of jobs into the GTA put the lie to that. This is not about creating jobs or being “for the people.” It’s about putting the boots to those at the bottom and it goes in exactly the wrong direction.

"Funny how Progressive Conservative members of the Ontario legislature from Milton, Brampton and Markham were happy to cheer on the decision to locate satellite university campuses in their communities. But that was then — before June’s provincial election, when the Wynne government was in power and was announcing that new campuses would be funded in these three rapidly growing cities. It seemed like a great idea to all local representatives, including the PCs. But now that the Conservatives own Queen’s Park, those campuses have apparently gone from being wise investments in post-secondary education and underserved communities to being just so much needless spending. How else to interpret  because of what it calls the province’s “new fiscal restraints,” saving a total of $305 million? The Conservatives never mentioned cutting these campuses during the election campaign. On the contrary. Doug Ford made it sound as if any cuts would be painless trims to “fat” in the system. But cancelling these projects is a real blow to the future of all three communities, and a setback for educational opportunities in communities that aren’t well-served by post-secondary institutions.  Brampton, for example, has 600,000 people and is growing so fast that it’s forecast to hit a million in little more than 20 years. It’s the biggest city in the country without a university, and a satellite campus of Ryerson University and Sheridan College would have been a big step toward filling the education gap there. This is a short-sighted decision that will hurt development in the communities affected and damage attempts to make sure Ontario’s workforce is as well-trained as it could be. The Ford government should take the long view and think again. ",0,Cancelling new campuses is a short-sighted move
"It’s possible — easy, even — to pick apart  in provinces that refuse to do the job themselves. Many environmentalists will point out that it isn’t ambitious enough to go very far toward fighting the effects of climate change, and they will be right. Others will argue that the government’s plan to refund the cost of the tax to people in the four affected provinces next spring is a politically motivated move in an election year. They may be right, as well. But quibbles aside, the Liberal government is firmly on the right side of what is shaping up to be one of the main issues in next fall’s election, perhaps   defining issue. The Trudeau plan isn’t a comprehensive solution to tackling climate change; in fact, no one ever pretended it was. And no doubt political calculations are involved in softening the impact on voters by making sure the average family actually comes out ahead when it receives a rebate next spring through the income tax system. We doubt many will be shocked at the idea that politicians take the political angles into account. But if it takes some political finagling to make it work, that will be a small price to pay to see a price put on carbon right across Canada. The evidence, and simple logic, are overwhelming that putting a price on something incents people and businesses to produce less of it. Imposing a price on carbon emissions, even a relatively low one to start with, is the smartest and most efficient way to reduce emissions. Economists from both right and left agree on that. It would have been far preferable for the provinces to devise their own plans and avoid turning this issue into a federal-provincial confrontation. And when the Trudeau Liberals first brought up the idea it looked as though almost all provinces, with the exception of Saskatchewan, would go along. That changed when the Ford Conservatives were elected in Ontario and dumped the province’s cap-and-trade program. Manitoba and New Brunswick have turned against carbon pricing, too, and Alberta will join the conservative pack if its NDP government goes down to defeat next year, as is likely. But awkward as it may be, the federal government is right to persist even if it means a fight. Climate change is too important an issue to let opposition from conservative-led governments stall action entirely. The latest of many reminders on that front came just a couple of weeks ago, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a comprehensive new assessment that the world has only about a dozen more years to stop global warming from becoming a catastrophe. In the face of this, what do the conservative opponents of carbon pricing and the Trudeau government’s rebate program propose? In a word, nothing. When the Ford government axed Ontario’s cap-and-trade regime, it failed to come up with anything to replace it. Instead, Premier Doug Ford started crusading across the country against the “job-killing carbon tax.” He has a slogan, not a climate plan. Federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has nothing more to offer. He promises his party will come up with a climate plan before the next election. In the meantime, he’s content to join the conservative common front railing against taxes and Trudeau. It’s the opposite of leadership on this crucial issue. Even with the federal carbon tax, starting at $20 a tonne next year and rising to $50 by 2022, Canada risks falling short of its targets on climate change, by the government’s own admission. Carbon pricing in the way the government has chosen to do it is a timid first step. But if the government gives up even that in the face of opposition, it has no hope at all of making progress. It has chosen to stand and fight on this issue, and it is right to do so. ",0,The Trudeau government is right to impose carbon pricing
"On Toronto’s streets this past weekend,   that had stubbornly stood for 43 years. And since it was his first ever race at the marathon distance it would be easy to assume the 29-year-old from British Columbia is one of those rare athletes for whom things come easily. The reality, though, makes his record-breaking run of two hours, nine minutes and 25 seconds all the more inspiring. Levins was a standout distance runner in university and in 2012 became the first Canadian to win the Bowerman Award as the top male track and field athlete in the elite American NCAA system. The international results and Canadian records that followed suggested even bigger things were just around the corner. But that great trajectory came to a crashing halt in 2015 with a fluke foot injury. And the last thee years have been so difficult that track observers waited for a retirement announcement, and Levins himself said he often considered quitting. But he didn’t. He fought back the doubts and eventually recovered to put in the daunting training mileage needed to get back in the game. And in the crucial final kilometres of his 42.2 km effort he told himself he’d come too far to do anything but keep going — and with speed. “I’m going to take back my career and be back to the athlete I know I can be,” Levins said later. His result rewrites Canada’s men’s marathon record book, which hasn’t been updated since 1975 when Jerome Drayton ran a marathon in two hours, 10 minutes and nine seconds.  Knowing how easy it would have been for Levins to have given up during his years of struggle — but that he didn’t — is as inspiring as the record-breaking run itself.

She stood in front of a shelter near King St. and Spadina Ave. that includes a splintered bike helmet and the story of Edouard Le Blanc, a 62-year-old cyclist who was struck so hard by a Scarborough driver that his organs were unfit for donation. Briegmann-Samson told reporters she believes five such displays, along with radio, TV, print and social media ads to run until mid-December, will send motorists the message they need to keep their eyes on the road and the vulnerable people they can so easily kill. “I am hopeful that this will ... raise the conversation to the next level,” and render distracted driving socially unacceptable, she said. “The same thing had to happen with drinking and driving and that took many decades to get to the point where legislation was changed and stronger deterrents were put in place.” At least 33 pedestrians and five cyclists have died this year in Toronto after being struck by drivers, according to figures kept by the Star’s Ben Spurr.

"Ontario school boards need to have clear, consistent policies when it comes to students’ service dogs — instead of the patchwork that now exists, says Education Minister Lisa Thompson. As part of wide-ranging education legislation that passed first reading last week — the   — the government wants to “establish policies and guidelines respecting service animals in schools,” that boards must follow when creating their own rules. Right now, 39 of 72 public boards have policies covering service dogs, which typically outline the documentation required and the steps schools must take when dealing with a request to allow an animal in a classroom. “We heard first-hand from families who are frustrated” that one school board will allow a student’s service dogs that another board refused, Thompson said at Queen’s Park on Tuesday. Mindful of the rights of students or teachers who are allergic, Thompson said the government will hold consultations with advocacy and support groups, as well as families and educators. “That’s why we are opening it up to all parties,” Thompson said. “We want to make sure we get it right. That’s why we are listening to our teachers, our families, our partners.” Service dogs include those who assist students who are blind, have mobility issues or need them for emotional support.  Dena Warman, a Toronto mother of two, said some of her family members have severe allergies and she worries about schoolchildren who do too. She hopes that concern is not overlooked. “People have different opinions about animals generally, and cleanliness,” she also said, as well as worries they could be a distraction to other students. Warman said she’s not entirely opposed to dogs in classrooms, but thinks all health issues need to be taken into account. But the issue, she added, is “equity for everybody … I’m open to try to find ways to meet everybody’s needs.”  In the legislature Tuesday, MPP Amy Fee (Kitchener South-Hespeler) said “world-class education means accommodating all students, including those with unique learning needs. Research shows that service and therapy animals provide a wide range of emotional and physical support for students.” In 2017, her son was  to a service dog in his elementary school, after Ontario’s human rights tribunal said the family did not prove the boy needed him in the classroom for  . Fee told the Star that for her, “it’s very important that school boards can’t determine the need for a service animal — to me, it is important that a medical professional or service-dog trainer determines that need for the child.” The Ontario Public School Boards’ Association says it has seen a jump in demand for service animals, and would like some guidance. Last year, it voted to ask the provincial government to consult with families of autistic children and others who need a service dog. Thompson said if passed, “school boards will be directed to have a publicly available, clear and fair policy regarding support animals” no matter where they live. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she will need to see the details, but “on the surface, the idea of having consistent policies around guide dogs or service dogs is a good step in the right direction.” ",0,Province looking for clear rules on service dogs in schools
"David Cox said it was good to see the spirit back on the Danforth.  The 25th Annual Taste of the Danforth festival began ‪Friday night‬, mere weeks after the bustling street turned into a scene of carnage. Two were killed and a dozen more were injured in a shooting rampage on July 22.  “People weren’t going to let that get them down, which is great to see, because it happened right over here,” said Cox outside his family’s business, The Friendly Greek, where they where serving fresh gyro from a stall outside the restaurant.  “It’s terrible, but it’s just good to see that people are still coming out; it didn’t scare everybody away.” The festival began with a moment of silence for 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and 18-year-old Reese Fallon, who were killed in the shooting.  The opening ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mayor John Tory.  It also honoured the official and unofficial first responders to the shooting, from police and firefighters and EMS to tattoo shop owner  , who helped two people injured in the gunfire. “We truly believe that without those first responders, it would have been a much bigger tragedy,” said festival organizer Howard Lichtman. Canada’s largest street festival will stretch across the Danforth this weekend with food, music and performances. By Friday evening, Danforth Ave. was full of people sitting on patios or buying food from stalls set up along the street.  Outside Athena Bakery, Greek pastries were on display.  Yanni Kollaras, whose family owns the business, said the pastries were like the ones “we have back home.” “We try to bring a little bit of that flavour from there to here.” Kollaras has worked at the bakery during the Taste of the Danforth since childhood.  “Doesn’t matter who you are, what you are, everyone just comes together and enjoys the day and the food and the festivities,” he said inside the bakery.  Kollaras added it was “pretty cool” that Trudeau would be at the festival. He hopes the recent shooting doesn’t affect the festival, he said, although he’d understand if it did.  “People should still come out and enjoy themselves rather than stay home cooped up, right?” About 1.6 million people are expected to attend the three-day event, which will go on no matter the weather. “I think what we’re going to see is what we’ve seen almost from the day after the tragic incident on the Danforth which is an outpouring of support and strength that has come, not just from people living in that area and working in that area, but people across the city,” said Mayor Tory, who spoke to reporters Friday after touring a TTC streetcar facility on Lake Shore Blvd. E. “I think Taste of the Danforth will have a record attendance this year because people want to send a signal at these events that we’re healing, that we’re resilient, that we’re strong, that we’re together.” During the festival, multiple memorials that sprang up along the Danforth will be consolidated into a single memorial near St. Barnabas Church (at 361 Danforth Ave.) so attendees can visit to pay their respects.  Friday evening, festivalgoers paused at the memorial, leaning in to read the gathered notes and posters.

"Nominally he is our provincial premier. Nationally, he is remaking himself into Captain Canada. We give you Doug Ford, carbon-tax-fighter-in-chief. One day he’s in Regina, the  , cavorting with Tories while caviling against carbon taxes until he can start all over again in Toronto. Back home Monday, he hosted Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe for a return visit. Tuesday he huddles with federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for another carbon-bashing session at Queen’s Park. As global warming looms over the planet, how did our humble province emerge as the national locus of the counterattack against  ? It’s not complicated. Taxes are toxic. Anti-tax rhetoric is the catnip of Canadian politics, fuelling Ford’s crusade. Any pretense of transformational politics has given way to transactional politics — where most voters calculate what’s in it for them, and premiers perform their own calculus. Ford has figured out what worked for him in the  , when he promised to “axe the tax.” He hasn’t stopped since. “As soon as I finish one campaign, I start campaigning right away the next day,” he boasted at a joint news conference with his Saskatchewan counterpart Monday. “I’m protecting the taxpayers of Ontario. That’s my job. I was elected to fight against taxes and the federal government wants to put an unfair tax on the backs of Ontario businesses and families. It’s a terrible tax.” But what if it’s not the carbon tax he imagined it to be? What if Ford is fighting a phantom? In fact, the  is closer to the “carbon fee and dividend” model espoused by conservatives in the U.S. and Canada for years — a revenue-neutral measure that raises money only to see it go back out again as rebates, so that the treasury is no further enriched. It is not merely a “price on pollution,” as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prefers to call it, but a price signal designed to deter polluters in the same way that high cigarette taxes discourage consumption. Unlike cigarette taxes, the money isn’t going into general revenues, but being disbursed in an elaborate cash-back program. Think of the premiums you pay for the Canada Pension Plan — which are segregated and invested by the CPP Investment Board and returned to you years later as retirement payouts that are worth far more. Are CPP deductions truly taxes if they are returned to you in larger amounts? Are pensions somehow a scam, in the same way that Ford decries the “carbon tax scam?” A similar debate played out over Ontario’s previous cap-and-trade program, which also used market forces to compel polluters to reduce their carbon footprint — by lowering the “cap” on total emissions, and forcing them to “trade” their way to compliance by buying and selling allowances at auction. Every economic analysis shows that Ontario’s cap-and-trade program, modelled on successful counterparts in Quebec and California, would have achieved better results at lower cost than a conventional carbon tax, by incentivizing innovation and investment. The premier’s mischaracterizations of cap and trade — it is a cost of doing business, not a carbon tax — helped him defeat an unpopular Kathleen Wynne in Ontario’s election. Now, he is redirecting his rhetorical attacks against Trudeau, even though it is entirely thanks to Ford that we lost our cap-and-trade exemption and will be subject to the federal carbon backstop starting in January. The premier has long been spoiling for a fight. Ford knows what he knows — that while Canadians love paying lip service to the environment, they are loath to pay up for it. “The good news is Canadians coast to coast are fighting back against the Trudeau carbon tax,” the premier proclaimed Monday, reading from his teleprompter. But this is not the clunky carbon tax target he was banking on when he vowed to spend $35 million on a doomed court battle to stop Ottawa from imposing a price on pollution. To repeat: While fee and dividend puts a price on carbon, the government gives the money back at year’s end — leaving people with the option to keep even more money in their pocket through conservation and fuel efficiency. Ford appears flummoxed by the cash flow. One moment, he accuses Trudeau of picking people’s pockets (taxes being theft in Tory terminology). In the next breath, he accuses Trudeau of buying people’s votes by giving the money right back to them. Which is it — theft or bribery? Both, in a manner of speaking — or, in political parlance, a potential win-win for both consumers and the environment. Unless Ontario’s new national tax-fighter-in-chief plays spoiler.

"The Ontario government is going ahead with funding for Collège Boréal to expand into Toronto’s Distillery District — a week after  planned for Brampton, Milton and Markham. A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held Monday with Attorney General Caroline Mulroney, who is bilingual and also the provincial minister responsible for Francophone affairs. “The new campus will allow Collège Boréal to increase its contribution to the excellence of our educational system and to the vitality of Toronto’s Francophone community,” she said in a written statement.  The college expansion is receiving $15 million from the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, with the remaining roughly $7 million coming from the college itself to renovate space in the historic downtown area.  The funding was welcome news after a surprise announcement last week by the province that hit three post-secondary projects: a Ryerson/Sheridan campus in Brampton, Wilfrid Laurier/Conestoga in Milton and York/Seneca in Markham. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Ford government decision flies in the face of promises made by Progressive Conservative MPPs who spoke in favour of three Liberal-promised projects during or after the election.  “People living in Brampton, Milton, and Markham have spent years fighting to give their children, and generations to come, more opportunity in their own communities,” she said in a statement after introducing an unsuccessful motion to restore the $307 million in funding for the three projects. “Now, just when GTA families could see that opportunity — three new university campuses — about to become a reality, Doug Ford ripped the carpet out from under them and callously defunded these projects overnight.” In the legislature, NDP MPP Chris Glover (Spadina-Fort York) — a former Toronto school board trustee and York University professor — asked why the government reneged on funding for the booming 905 communities. Post-secondary Minister Merrilee Fullerton said the Ford government “has had to make  about projects across Ontario” and that the move has the support of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance whose member institutions represent 150,000 students. Premier Doug Ford, speaking to reporters Monday at a press conference, said “the previous Liberal government went out and promised all these goodies they couldn’t afford. They misled the people … (they were) reckless, careless with taxpayer money.” However, he said the private sector “could jump in” and help keep the three projects alive.

"When news breaks in the GTA, chances are some of the first people in the Star’s newsroom to learn about it will be reporters affectionately known as “radio roomers.” Radio roomers are interns who work in a small, glass enclosure in the newsroom close to the Star’s digital- and breaking-news desks. Their job is to keep on top of breaking news 24 hours a day by scanning social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, and monitoring alerts from a wide range of sources, including police, paramedics, Environment Canada, and the TTC.  When news breaks, radio roomers are expected to alert editors and gather as much information as possible. This could mean reaching out to a police spokesperson in the event of an unfolding crime story, calling a climatologist if significant weather is imminent, or finding witnesses to a major car crash.  The radio room gets its name from a bank of electronic scanners that, up until a few years ago, would allow for the monitoring of radio communication by police, firefighters, and paramedics. The scanners would lock on to any channel in use, allowing interns to hear what first responders were saying to each other. This was particularly useful for gleaning details about unfolding events, such fires, robberies, or armed standoffs. In 2015, the scanners became obsolete after Toronto police began encrypting their radio transmissions. Now, social media has taken the place of the old scanners, and in many ways, is superior. “In the scanner days, we could hear radio calls between firefighters and dispatchers that would give us a location and a general sense of the scope of the fire, for example,” said assignment editor Barry Brimbecom, who works with the radio roomers regularly.  “In the era of social media, the first sighting of smoke or flames will have dozens of passersby tweeting descriptions, photos and video within minutes — or even seconds. And every person who posts is someone we can reach out to, someone who can answer questions about what they see and describe for us in detail what’s happening around them.” Radio roomers are also expected to find and speak to witnesses of calamities, such as crashes, and, if the story warrants, contact victims’ families.  The skills interns develop in the radio room — persistence, nimbleness, and a sharp attention to detail, to name just a few — help prepare them for working full-time in newsrooms anywhere. Many of the Star’s permanent reporters got their start in the radio room. The Star’s coverage of a   earlier this year provides an opportunity to show how radio roomers spring into action when news breaks.  Shortly before 4 p.m. on Oct. 20, radio roomer Alina Bykova had just started her shift when she saw a tweet from Toronto Police about a lockdown at David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute in Scarborough in relation to a stabbing. Bykova immediately called police to see what additional details she could find out. Media relations officer Const. David Hopkinson told her the stabbings had occurred on and around school property and that there were some people seriously injured.  Bykova relayed this information to deputy breaking news editor Serena Willoughby, who in turn dispatched reporter Victoria Gibson to the school.  Back in the radio room, Bykova called Toronto Paramedic Services and the Toronto District School Board in an effort to find out if any of the stabbing victims were students. “There was a bit of confusion about how many victims had been stabbed and where the stabbings had taken place, so I had to double-check with the spokespeople several times to make sure I had the right information,” said Bykova, 22, who is currently studying for a Master of Arts in European and Russian Affairs at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs.  Bykova wrote a brief story for thestar.com using the information she had confirmed, while Gibson interviewed students and gathered details at the scene and relayed what she learned back to the radio room. Gibson later headed to Sunnybrook Hospital to get a first-hand account from a witness. . With that, Gibson raced back to the Star to start writing. “I got back to the Star around 8:40 p.m., and worked with Alina to file all the information we had gathered and confirmed,” Gibson said. Bykova and Gibson were able to update the story online and for print to include the fact that three teenage boys had been stabbed, one of them critically, in a fight. One of the victims was a 17-year-old boy who was a student at the school. “We tell interns that speed and accuracy are paramount, but they aren’t equal — accuracy trumps speed every time,” said Brimbecom. “There’s no point in being faster than our competitors if our readers can’t trust us. Accuracy serves our readers, speed beats our competitors.” ",0,How the Star’s ‘radio room’ keeps tabs on breaking news
"Liberal MPP Nathalie Des Rosiers wants the provincial government to be more transparent about overriding Charter rights. Des Rosiers, a legal scholar and co-editor of the 1,168-page  , said Monday there must be greater scrutiny when governments decide to invoke the “notwithstanding clause.” That’s why she is tabling private member’s legislation so Ontarians would be told when any government bills or regulations may violate their rights and freedoms. It would also force the attorney general to table any legal arguments used to justify such a move. Premier Doug Ford, elected in June, threatened to use the measure for the first time in Ontario history — to   the size of Toronto city council — and has warned he “won’t be shy” about doing so again if courts try to thwart him. “This is a government that may be willing, quite readily, to violate our Charter rights,” said Des Rosiers (Ottawa-Vanier). “So this private member’s bill, if passed, would oblige the attorney general to inform the house — and to inform Ontarians — about what the possible violations would be of their rights,” she said, noting the Charter is essential in protecting the rights of all: “anyone who is a member of a religious minority, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Mennonite.” “I think today we particularly are sensitive to the way in which we must protect the rights of religious minorities throughout the world.” Hamilton lawyer Wade Poziomka, chair of the human rights section of the Ontario Bar Association, said Des Rosiers’ law could save taxpayers’ money. “MPPs of every political stripe should support this bill,” said Poziomka. “When we bring in bills that are unconstitutional and that violate the Charter, we’re inevitably going to find ourselves in litigation, which is lengthy and expensive, wasting taxpayers’ dollars and resources,” he said. After Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba in August struck down Ford’s bill as unconstitutional shrinking the size of Toronto council from 47 members to 25, the premier threatened to use the “notwithstanding clause” to overrule the court. The province ultimately did not need to invoke the clause as the Court of Appeal granted a stay of the ruling in September.

"Ontario will unveil its climate-change fighting plan next month, and Premier Doug Ford says his government will “be all over” polluters who break the rules. “When we went out to the public and talked to so many people, and done studies, it’s very simple,” Ford told reporters after meeting with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe at Queen’s Park where the duo reiterated their   to the federal government’s carbon tax. “People want clean air, they want clean lakes, they want clean rivers, they want clean parks and any emitters out there … we’re going to come down on those emitters like they’ve never seen before.” If they are “breaking the rules, they are breaking the laws, we are going to be all over them.” At an Empire Club luncheon, Environment Minister Rod Phillips said the government’s climate plan would be released November and that “affordability” will be a key theme. Opposition leaders have criticized both Ford and Moe for their stance against  that forced provinces to have an approved plan to fight  — or have the federal government impose one, as they plan to do in Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Manitoba. “Nobel prize-winning economists have said having a price on pollution is the most cost-effective, the lowest-cost solution and the best solution to driving down emissions and tackling climate change,” said Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, who called their battle a political one with the federal Liberals. He said Ford’s repeated line about such a tax hurting the economy is “B.S. ... the five best-performing provinces in Canada have a price on pollution” as do economically strong U.S. states and European jurisdictions. “It’s B.S. that it’s a job-killing plan. It’s just not,” he said, accusing Ford of putting ideology before evidence. “It’s pretty clear, as we go along, that this is a government that is not really interested in this issue,” said NDP Climate Change Critic Peter Tabuns. Ford will meet with federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer Tuesday at Queen’s Park to discuss carbon pricing.  Meanwhile, Ford and Moe also announced they’d signed a memorandum of understanding to start talks to break down inter-provincial trade barriers. “For all the talk about free trade with the U.S., there’s not enough action on free trade with Canada,” Ford said. “... We have to start knocking down the regulations and barriers between the provinces.” Businesses and leaders have told him “that this is one of the primary obstacles in attracting new investment and jobs to our country.” “What we need in Canada is a comprehensive approach, not a patchwork of little one-off agreements,” said the NDP’s Tabuns.  “This is much more about a media opportunity, a photo opportunity, than it is about anything serious to do with trade in Canada.” Schreiner said the memo was good news — but long overdue.  In Ottawa, federal Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc chided the two premiers. “It’s extremely disappointing to see Ontario and Saskatchewan play political games with such an important economic file after being the only provinces absent from the table at last week’s meeting in Vancouver on internal trade and the USMCA,” said LeBlanc, referring to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “The premiers need to stop putting their partisan interests ahead of the growth of the economy and the well-being of Canadians,” he said.

"In addition to repeating inaccurate claims about the impact of the federal carbon tax, Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated new ones on Monday. Speaking alongside Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, Ford told reporters in Toronto that the carbon tax will cost families much more than they will get back, and that it will cost a single individual $649. According to the federal government and an independent report from Ontario’s budget watchdog, those statements are not accurate. Ford made similar claims on Friday, which iPolitics  . When questioned, Ford defended the numbers he used, but didn’t explain where he got them. He would only say that because people consume gas and fuel differently, they will incur different costs under the tax. When he released details of the carbon tax last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the plan was a critical part of Canada’s  Here’s a look at what Ford said on Monday. “He’s saying he’ll give you X amount back, and then he’ll charge you four times more to go into his coffers.”  The federal government says 70 per cent of families will get more money back from the carbon tax than what they pay. For example, Ottawa says the average Ontario household (of 2.6 people) will incur $244 in new costs from the tax, but receive $300 back in a rebate. That is backed up by Ontario’s Financial Accountability Officer, who  . Peter Weltman’s office studied the tax before all the details were released by Ottawa. The report finds that costs for the average household in Ontario will increase by $258, but a rebate of about $355 will more than cover them. The key difference between the budget watchdog’s report and Ottawa’s final numbers is that the Financial Accountability Office assumes Ottawa will send all carbon-tax revenues back to households. Instead, 90 per cent will be sent back to households, and the remaining 10 per cent will be distributed to not-for-profit organizations and small- and medium-sized businesses. The premier’s office did not respond to a request for the source of Ford’s claim that it would cost Ontarians four times more. “No one knows the average. It’s about $649; again, that’s just on each individual. On other people that drive constantly, say they have an hour drive — back and forth to work every single day — it’s going to cost them more. Gas prices are going up, cost of heating your home is going to go up, cost of every single good and service in this province, across this country, is going to be taxed.” The Trudeau government has released average costs for households for the first four years of the carbon tax. Next year, it says the carbon tax will cost the average household $244. By 2022, the average cost is projected to rise to $564 and the rebate is estimated to go up to $697. The federal government’s cost estimate for 2022 is substantially lower than the estimate in the Financial Accountability Officer’s report, which pegs the average cost for each household at $648. The office didn’t release an estimate of the rebate for future years. Ford appeared to be applying the budget watchdog’s estimated cost for an entire household to the cost for a single individual, but his office did not reply to a request to clarify his numbers. Despite repeating inaccurate claims about the cost of the carbon tax, Ford said his attacks are “not fear-mongering.” Green Party Leader and MPP Mike Schreiner said people should be “outraged” by Ford’s comments on the carbon tax. “It makes absolutely no sense. Clearly, he’s making it up as he goes,” Schreiner said. “If you look at the federal carbon plan, most people are going to end up with money in their pocketbook. The FAO has confirmed that, as well, so to say that it’s going to cost you more money is just wrong.” Ottawa has said revenues from the carbon tax will be audited annually to ensure they are revenue-neutral.

"The premiers of Ontario and Saskatchewan want to take the lead on breaking down interprovincial trade barriers across the country — and have agreed to start making changes in their own backyards first. Doug Ford and Scott Moe have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote free trade between their jurisdictions. Currently, about $11 billion worth of goods and services are exchanged between the two provinces. “We’re going to blaze a new trail,” Ford said Tuesday in the legislature. Following the deal with Saskatchewan, “you’re going to see all the other provinces hop on board. We talk about the USMCA (the new NAFTA) deal — and we can’t even get trade down within our own country.  “But under our leadership, we’ll make sure that happens.” The opposition criticized Ford on Tuesday for not sending representatives to attend a recent meeting with other provinces on the issue. New Democrat MPP and trade critic Taras Natyshak said Saskatchewan only amounts to about 5 per cent of Ontario’s total interprovincial trade. So why were they “the only two provinces to skip a meeting of interprovincial trade this past week?” he said. “That’s where the other 95 per cent of interprovincial trade is actually being discussed.” On Monday, after meeting with Moe, Ford said it’s time to “start knocking down the regulations and barriers between the provinces.” Businesses and leaders have told him “that this is one of the primary obstacles in attracting new investment and jobs to our country.” But it’s no easy task. At a July meeting of premiers in New Brunswick, the leaders weren’t able to come to any formal trade agreements, only announcing  to reduce the limits of alcohol allowed over provincial and territorial borders.  “What we need in Canada is a comprehensive approach, not a patchwork of little one-off agreements,” said New Democrat MPP Peter Tabuns after Ford and Moe’s announcement. “This is much more about a media opportunity — a photo opportunity — than it is about anything serious to do with trade in Canada.” Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said any move to reduce trade barriers is welcome, but long overdue. “In some ways it’s ridiculous that we negotiate trade deals with other countries and we don’t actually have free trade within our own country,” he said. Ford cited a recent study that said improving trade among all the provinces would give a $50 billion boost to Canada’s GDP over the next decade, about $15 to $20 billion for Ontario alone. “We can’t afford not to act,” Ford told reporters Monday. “I’m pleased to say Saskatchewan and Ontario are working together. We’re going to lead where Ottawa has totally failed.” In Ottawa, federal Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc chided the two premiers. “It’s extremely disappointing to see Ontario and Saskatchewan play political games with such an important economic file after being the only provinces absent from the table at last week’s meeting in Vancouver on internal trade and the USMCA,” said LeBlanc. Trade Minister Jim Wilson — who noted he’s been at Queen’s Park for 28 years — said “I can’t name you five interprovincial trade barriers we’ve ever brought down in that time ... If we bring down trade barriers with Saskatchewan, we’ll do more trade, we’ll do more exports outside of Canada, and the rest of the provinces will follow.” ",0,"Ontario, Saskatchewan to boost trade ties"
"Today’s fight over carbon pricing isn’t the ideological battle of the century. That would be a historic misunderstanding of our future by politicians fighting the last war. Despite Premier Doug Ford’s  , this week’s embrace of  by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau isn’t proof of a left wing plot to pick the pockets of Canadians. To the contrary, it is evidence of a remarkable role reversal — the culmination of conservative political thought and the triumph of right-wing market forces now being adopted by mainstream politicians. Global warming isn’t ideological, it’s empirical. The chill wind blowing from the right wing isn’t conceptual, it’s electoral. And the federal-provincial court fight brewing over carbon pricing isn’t jurisdictional, it’s purely political. To understand the war of words, it’s helpful to look beyond mere strategy and tactics. And consider the telltale clues over semantics and antics. Politicians who previously promised to impose carbon taxes are now running away from them. And conservative critics who long campaigned for free market solutions are now complaining about them. When the federal government eschews the phrase “carbon tax” — preferring to call it a price on pollution — that’s not a word game conjured up by Canada’s Liberals trying to rebrand a revenue grab. It’s a concept promoted by influential American Republicans to persuade their own partisans that global warming requires economic solutions as much as political prescriptions. Never mind cap and trade, whose complexity and opacity was exceeded only by its economic efficiency. It’s gone forever from Ontario, dismantled at great expense by Premier Doug Ford as part of his phoney war against an illusory “carbon tax.” Having killed the carbon tax that never was, Ford has been salivating to slay the new federal carbon tax that never came to pass. “Trudeau does not have the right to ram a carbon tax down the throats of Ontario families and job-creators,” the premier raged this week. “This massive tax hike from the federal government will jack up the cost of living for each and every Ontario family and business.” Never mind that Trudeau clearly does have the constitutional right, not to mention the electoral mandate. What counts is that the federal plan is not a conventional carbon tax, and will not raise the cost of living for Ontarians, because it is actually a revenue redistribution plan. Welcome to the world of “carbon fee and dividend,” advocated by former secretaries of state George P. Schultz and James Baker III, promoted by Green party politicians, and blessed by skeptical right-wing columnists as the optimal solution for our political and climatic environment. The Trudeau Liberals now understand that if you can’t beat the critics, just co-opt them. What Ford calls a tax, the government now calls a pollution fee. And while opponents claim it’s a cash grab, the government is astutely playing the cash-back card, by promising to reimburse at least as much money to citizens. To the frustration of Ford and federal Conservative opposition leader Andrew  , the Trudeau Liberals have taken a page from the Tories’ playbook and are singing from the Republican songbook. Rather than relying on transformational politics, they are counting on transactional politics. Hence the “dividend” component of the “carbon fee and dividend” equation: First, collect fees from polluters. Second, acknowledge that like any cost of doing business — from water usage charges to zoning requirements or corporate taxes — those costs will be more or less passed on to consumers. Third, rebate that “windfall” in the form of so-called dividends for consumers. Is it a shell game, as Scheer and Ford claim? No, merely being revenue neutral does not emasculate it economically. Even if the government gives back your (revenue neutral) cut of the windfall, you are still incentivized to lower your consumption of carbon — by getting a more fuel-efficient vehicle or insulating your home. Despite the government rebate, it’s not necessarily a wash, because the smart consumer will still try to come out ahead — maximizing his savings by minimizing his exposure to carbon fees. Think of government employees who get a fixed “per diem” amount for meals when on the road, in lieu of submitting restaurant receipts for reimbursement. Have you ever noticed how those public servants try to minimize their meal expenses so that they come in under the per diem — and pocket the difference? Nothing wrong with that under the rules, because it’s a win-win — it discourages overconsumption, and actually saves the employer money by avoiding lavish restaurant bills. That’s the analogy to fee and dividend. You get a fixed amount back from the government, representing your share of the overall fees collected. But it’s still in your interests to minimize your exposure to those fees in your day to day life. It’s a free market solution that relies on price signals (just as cap and trade was, before Tories turned on it for partisan gain). “It comes out of free-market thinking in the U.S.,” notes Mike Schreiner, leader of the Ontario Greens whose party has long called for fee and dividend as the best way to build enduring political support for environmental action. But now, right wingers who might be expected to endorse price signals out of fidelity to their own ideology are suddenly “all opposed to it — and I find that infuriating.” It’s not hocus-pocus, merely a way of nudging people into better environmental behaviour in a hostile political environment that Ontario’s premier is so keen to exploit. “The people of Canada,” Ford huffed the other day (wait — isn’t he leading the people of Ontario?) “are too smart to believe that Trudeau’s phoney rebates are anything more than a temporary vote buying scheme ... The carbon tax rip-off is forever.” On current trends, global warming is forever. Carbon pricing is just beginning. ",0,How Justin Trudeau and Doug Ford traded places on carbon pricing
"Resist the temptation to give Toronto’s mayor any more power. The only essential power lacking in the office is one the provincial government will not give — independence from the shackles of provincial control that would insulate the city from arbitrary decisions at Queen’s Park. In other words, Mayor John Tory doesn’t need to lord over city council; he needs Premier Doug Ford’s boots off the city’s neck.  In the absence of the latter — and in the aftermath of Doug Ford’s vindictive attack on Toronto council,  —  are misplaced. The attention is best concentrated on how to manage the same workload with half the councillors. Toronto’s practice in normal times has been to consult widely on such matters and arrive at a compromise that straddles those who could care less about government, local democracy, public consultation or civic engagement and those who may be consumed by the ideal. The Doug Ford tornado — quick and vicious — leaves little time for careful consideration. The new city council will meet in December. Would-be reformers have seized the opportunity to  . Much of it is good, when directed at the opportunities to replace elected officials with citizens on the myriad of city-owned boards and commissions. But even here, caution is required. Civic appointments to these agencies have been corrupted in the past. They often do not reflect the city’s diversity, are populated by the privileged, and become a landing spot for political patronage. While city council is forced into an urgent decision on its committee structure, post Ford tsunami, there is no urgency or need to change the statutory powers of the mayor, vis-à-vis city council. Every four years, the hand-wringing and speculation and handicapping begin as soon as the civic election ends. Did  ? Will the mayor be able to control city council and follow through on his or her mandate? Does the mayor need more power in a system that does not have party politics, neither cabinet solidarity nor a mayor’s veto? City council is always tilted to the political right, but only so slightly. This has not changed, and will not for a long time. Downtown wards and their large population are leftist. Etobicoke is most conservative. Parts of North York and Scarborough are right-leaning. And a large number of wards are middle-of-the road moderates. It’s a Toronto thing. On city council, the so-called moderates, properly dubbed the Mushy Middle, always carry the balance of power. But because of their fluctuating principles, they can easily be co-opted — bought for the price of a “plum” political appointment. It is the mayor who controls the appointments — even though city council can, theoretically, overturn them. In practice, council approves 99 per cent of the mayor’s appointments at the first council meeting, including his executive committee, hand-picked deputy mayors and his allies who have nearly all pledged allegiance to the chief magistrate.  On the old council there were literally hundreds of positions that councillors filled on standing committees of council, city-run agencies, boards and commissions. Now that city council is half the size the work still needs to be done. There will be no shortage of plum appointments, even if many are farmed out to citizens. Therefore, only a totally inept mayor would be incapable of “buying” enough loyalty from the majority of councillors so he is guaranteed majority support on issues he cares about. If he can’t, that is a clear signal the mayor is a bust, not that he should be propped up by giving him more power. One should anticipate the worst in such arrangements. What happens if the worse possible mayoral candidate somehow gets the most votes and takes the city down an unimaginable path? Current political reality makes such musing wise, not theoretical. Imagine if Rob Ford had been afforded statutory powers to override city council? Imagine if he could have made his councillor brother, the now knife-wielding premier of Ontario, his official henchman unchecked by council vote? Imagine if he could have hired and fired the police chief at will — especially if the chief has ordered an investigation into the mayor’s drug-abusing habits?  Imagine such a “strong mayor” at Toronto city hall in cahoots with a quixotic premier at Queen’s Park. Together, they might divert hundreds of millions of dollars away from building universities and helping the poor and, instead, throw billions of dollars at subway lines that are not needed. Imagine them scheming to end the city’s land transfer tax, robbing the city of $500 million in annual revenue, forcing city hall to sell off government housing, curtail spending in priority neighbourhoods, cut civic and arts grants, deplete environmental initiatives, remove bike lanes and those “ ,” and turn over city assets to private sector plundering. Toronto doesn’t need a “strong mayor” political system. The city needs a mayor strong enough to stand up for Toronto against the wave of disastrous policy decisions expected to come from Queen’s Park. That strength comes from city council, not from subjugating it. ",0,Toronto’s mayor doesn’t need more powers
"The decision to keep the minimum wage at $14 will take a toll on health. Avoiding health impacts will come at a cost. We need to decide who is going to pay and whether low-paid jobs are the way forward for Ontario. The Making Ontario Open for Business Act aims to bring jobs back to the province, lighten the burden on business and make sure hard work is rewarded. It is not clear that repealing Bill-148 will have all those effects or exactly what the impacts the alternate government measures will be. But we do know that keeping the minimum wage at $14 an hour for nearly three years will be bad for public health.  Poverty is one of the best predictors of health. People making minimum wage earn less than $20,000 for a 40-hour week, and hover near the poverty line. They will live up to five fewer years than people who have higher wages, they will use more health and social services and their children will do less well at school and be at increased risk of illness themselves. Canada has a high poverty rate for a developed country and Toronto is the child poverty capital of Canada. Poverty and low wages decrease your life expectancy and increase the risk of cancer, heart disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents, and mental health and addiction problems, just to name a few.  It’s like treading water in the sea. If you stop treading, you’ll drown; if you keep treading, you use so much energy that you just wear out. The eventual outcome of both cases is the same. We need a way to keep people’s heads above water. A decent minimum wage and job security puts a platform under people’s feet. It gives them the opportunity to do more than tread water. It can allow them to participate fully in society and make the most of themselves. By doing this, it can decrease health inequities.  Some will argue that most people who earn a minimum wage are students. In fact, 40 per cent of people who earn the minimum wage and 60 per cent of people who earn a few cents more than the minimum wage are over 25 years of age. They are more likely to be women and from racialized groups. Their pay makes a real difference to their families.  We could focus on building an economy that is favourable for business and hope that businesses pass on the benefits to workers. But recent history has shown this is unlikely. Profits linked to increased productivity have not been passed on to lower-paid workers. Automation, globalization, decreased union membership and changes in the number of people getting benefits has meant that, in real terms, low-paid workers are getting the worst deal they’ve had for 50 years. The Wellesley Institute used an evidence-based approach to calculate how much money a person needs to live a healthy life in Toronto and found that a single person aged 25-40 would need $46,000 a year after tax. A person earning minimum wage would have to work more than double the healthy 40-hour work week to achieve this. If not, they would have a gap of more than $25,000 to fill. But if they do not fill the gap, the costs do not go away. We will all have to pay for increased health services, social services and increased crime, a predictable consequence of a population earning low wages.  At some point, we must decide who or what will fill the gap. Will it be industry, the province, or will we just let people fend for themselves? If we do the last, we are agreeing to build an economy and society favourable for business at the expense of public health.  We need to attract industry that offers jobs we can afford. We need to decide whether low-paid jobs are the way forward in Ontario and consider what needs to be done so that we do not trap workers in poverty. Hard-working people are just a paycheque away from going under, and their health is suffering. Those earning the current minimum wage will have health impacts and these will only increase.  It has been said that a job is good for your health. But the truth is that only a good job is good for your health. And good jobs are good for Ontario.

"A new bill on workplace standards introduced Tuesday at Queen’s Park is a “sweet deal” for big employers, but working families “just got screwed,” according to the Toronto & York Region Labour Council. “If you run a billion-dollar company like Walmart, McDonald’s, or Tim Hortons, you just got one awful sweet deal from Doug Ford. If you run a temp agency, you can pay poverty wages as a business model,” said labour council president John Cartwright. “But if you work for a living in this province, odds are that someone in your family just got screwed.” Rocco Rossi, who heads the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, called the Ford government’s proposed bill “welcome news for workers and businesses of all sizes throughout Ontario, as well as a bold step in creating a stronger and more prosperous province.” Worker advocates organized an emergency rally outside the Ministry of Labour this week following the government’s introduction of Bill 47, which will repeal the bulk of new  brought in earlier this year under the Liberal government through Bill 148. Here’s a rundown of how your rights on the job will change if Bill 47 is passed. A scheduled bump from $14 to $15 is cancelled. The  will be frozen at $14 until 2020, when increases will become tied to inflation. A provision requiring the government to review minimum wage levels every five years is cancelled. Temporary, casual, and part-time workers will no longer be entitled to be paid the same wage for doing the same job as permanent or directly-hired colleagues. Bill 148 expanded existing protections for women to be paid the same as men to precarious workers. Bill 47 keeps the gender-based equal pay rules but removes the right of all workers, including women concerned about discriminatory pay, to request that their employer review their rate of pay.  Workers will no longer be entitled to two paid sick days and eight unpaid emergency leave days. Instead, they will get three sick days, three personal days and two bereavement days. Workers will not be able to use the two bereavement days for other kids’ emergencies if they do not experience a loss in the family that year. All leave days will be unpaid.  Employers will once again be allowed to ask for doctor’s notes. Numerous scheduling rights will change. Workers with three months service will no longer have the right to request schedule or work location changes. Employers will no longer need to pay a minimum of three hours’ wages if an employee is on call but doesn’t get a shift. Workers will not have the right to refuse last-minute requests to work shifts they weren’t scheduled for. Workers will no longer receive three hours pay if their shift is cancelled within 48 hours before it was meant to start.  Under Bill 47, workers who “regularly” work more than three hours but are given less than three hours when they show up will still get paid for at least three hours work. It will remain illegal to misclassify an employee as an independent contractor, a category of worker that has no protection under employment laws. However, Bill 47 will remove a new measure that put the onus on employers to prove that a worker was a true independent contractor when a dispute over classification arises.  Maximum penalties for “notices of contravention,” or a ticket for breaking basic employment laws, will decrease. Bill 47 also drastically reduces fines for violating the Labour Relations Act, which governs dealings between unions and employers.  However, Bill 47 will not amend other areas of enforcement, including new powers to charge interest on unpaid wages as well as expanded collections and information sharing powers in wage theft cases.  Workers also won’t have to contact their employer before filing an employment standards claim, a new protection brought in by Bill 148 that remains unchanged. Bill 47 cancels measures that made it easier for some vulnerable workers — those in building services, home care workers, or working through temp agencies — to unionize. The new legislation also revives rules around strikes and lockouts introduced under former Conservative premier Mike Harris. Under Bill 47, workers on strike or locked out for more than six months will no longer have the right to get their job back when the dispute is resolved. These provisions, many of which were introduced to bring Ontario in line with new federal legislation, will remain largely intact. For example, workers can still take up to 17 weeks leave to care for a critically ill adult family member, or up to 37 if the family member is a child. The Conservatives will also keep the increased 65 week parental leave entitlement. Increased leave for those who have experienced a pregnancy loss will also stay. These protections, which give workers up to 15 weeks of protected leave in the case of sexual or domestic violence, will stay in place. New provisions giving three weeks holiday to workers with five years’ service at the same company will stay. ",0,How your rights on the job will change if Bill 47 is passed
"Fred Ansaldo never saw the driver who hit him coming. He was riding a Bikeshare bicycle on Front St. W. a few days before Christmas in 2016 when he suddenly felt something strike his back wheel.  The impact launched him off the bike and onto the hood of the car. He fell to the ground, and rolled out of the way just in time to see one of the vehicle’s wheels coming to a stop inches from his head.  As he lay there dazed, a thought intruded into his mind. “Oh s---,” he thought. “She’s running away.” The driver had stopped momentarily after the impact, Ansaldo recalled in a recent interview, but he watched in shock as the person behind the wheel sped off down Front St., in full view of the crowds of people who were on the busy downtown street at morning rush hour. “It was surprise first, because I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Ansaldo said. “And then it was anger.” The hit-and-run collision left Ansaldo with a broken tailbone, and he said still experiences pain as a result of the incident. But other victims of similar crashes haven’t escaped with only injuries. In the past three weeks, there has been a rash of fatal hit-and-runs in Toronto. Since Sept. 21, four drivers have fled collisions that left a pedestrian dead, according to statistics compiled by the Star based on police news releases and media reports.  Of the at least 32 pedestrians killed so far this year, nine of them, or almost one third, were victims of hit-and-runs.  They include 50-year-old Isabel Soria, who was killed after she was hit by the driver of a pickup truck on Dufferin St. on June 11. According to police, the driver got out of the vehicle, approached the dying woman, and then sped off. A 27-year-old man from Oshawa was later arrested. On Sept. 26, a 61-year-old man was run down while crossing St. Clair Ave. E. The same day a 79-year-old was struck in Scarborough by a minivan driver that left the scene. The victim died 10 days later.  In response to the Star’s questions this week, Toronto Police couldn’t immediately say whether the number of “fail to remain” collisions in 2018 represent an increase compared to previous years. Nor could they say whether the majority of drivers who flee the scene are eventually apprehended. But Sgt. Brett Moore of traffic services said “the public and police take these crimes especially seriously and apply all available resources and techniques to solve them.”  The penalties for hit-and-run drivers who are caught can be severe. Under the Criminal Code of Canada, a person who knowingly leaves the scene of deadly accident is liable for a maximum sentence of life in prison. If the victim was seriously injured, the driver could be jailed for up to 10 years. However, drivers can also face lesser, non-criminal charges under the provincial Highway Traffic Act, which sets maximum penalties for leaving the scene at a $2,000 fine and up to six months imprisonment. When drivers do face criminal charges, they often get far less than the maximum. In 2012, a driver who left the scene after killing 30-year-old Kevin Mounce in Niagara Falls, and then and actively tried to cover up the crash by hiding her car and having a friend secretly repair her damaged windshield, received a sentence of two years less a day. Lawyer and road safety advocate Patrick Brown, who represented Mounce’s family in a civil suit, questioned whether such sentences go far enough. He said any hit-and-run is “an egregious crime.”  “As soon as you leave the scene, you’ve made an intentional act to leave somebody back there,” he said. “That is a criminal act, and it should be faced with very harsh criminal penalties.” He argued non-criminal Highway Traffic Act charges are always inappropriate for hit-and-runs. Although little research has been done on the subject, Paul Thomas Clements, a forensic psychiatric behaviour analyst and professor at Philadelphia’s Drexel University, said there’s a “broad continuum” of types of drivers who flee the scene of a serious crash.  Clements said the most common type are drivers who are already committing another offence at the time of the collision, such as driving drunk or with a suspended licence, and leave to avoid harsher punishment.  Other hit-and-runners simply panic as a result of a “fight or flight” response, he said. This group is more likely to turn themselves in, especially if they’re younger. “My experience is teenagers and younger people … tend to be the ones who can’t deal with the guilt,” he said. “As soon as they saw that they hit someone, they just hit the gas and go, they’re not thinking. But then when they get home and they start thinking about the reality of it, those who have morality they just can’t deal with the guilt.” A smaller group simply experience no remorse at injuring someone. Clements said this type of driver may have a serious personality disorder that enables them to rationalize what they’ve done, often by blaming their victim with arguments like “if you weren’t out in the road so far, I wouldn’t have hit you.” The recent hit-and-runs in Toronto include a tragic crash that killed  . He was riding his skateboard on Sheppard Ave. E. at around 1:15 a.m. on Oct. 8 when he was hit by a driver who, according to police, got out of her car, checked on Alexander, and then drove away.  Longtime friend Chris Hughes said he and Alexander’s family are hoping the driver turns herself in, not because they want her to be punished, but because her decision to leave the scene has left them with painful questions about what happened in Alexander’s final moments.  “The family just wants to lay him to rest right now and sort of grieve. It’s a tragedy,” Hughes said in an interview Thursday. “But we do want answers too.” He said he didn’t think there was anything he or the family could say to convince the driver to come forward, but he hoped her conscience was weighing on her. “I’m not certain if there’s any words. It’s been three days now ... I think it’s just going to be her own emotion and guilt that will do the trick.” It’s been two years since Ansaldo was hit on his bike on Front St., and no charges have been laid against the driver who struck him. He’s still fuming the driver hasn’t faced consequences. He said he was able to get the car’s licence plate number. But according to his account, which the police neither confirmed nor denied, officers told him they went to the home of the woman who owned the vehicle, but she said someone else had been behind the wheel. When the police returned about a week later, she had disappeared. “I’m very, very upset about it,” he said. “Not only (did) she hit me, she might be on the road again and she might hit other people.” ",0,"Why do hit-and-run drivers flee?

"Vic Fedeli is blasting a Progressive Conservative MPP’s husband running to be  next month for unauthorized use of the finance minister’s image in campaign materials.  Fedeli accuses grassroots Tory activist Jim Karahalios — a lawyer and spouse of Cambridge MPP Belinda Karahalios — of unfair “personal attacks” online and misusing his words as a testimonial. Karahalios, who made his name fighting ousted PC leader Patrick Brown over a promised carbon tax, on Friday dismissed Fedeli’s complaint as “ridiculous.”  He charged the finance minister is trying to bolster support for rival presidential candidate Brian Patterson, a party veteran who has worked with leaders since Bill Davis in the 1980s and is the preference of Premier Doug Ford. “It’s disappointing to see an online attack launched against me. I spoke to Jim Karahalios personally and asked him to retract a flyer that used my image without my consent, which he refused,” Fedeli tweeted Thursday.  “Now we see personal attacks and revisionist history. We need a party president that is respectful of its members, and it’s clear that president should be Brian Patterson.” A Karahalios brochure uses a head shot of Fedeli, who as interim leader last winter hailed the Cambridge lawyer for his outspoken criticism of Brown and  as a party member. “It was part of a   where (Fedeli) apologized and praised the importance of my campaigns and there was no time limit on the quote,” said Karahalios, noting the treasurer’s comment was dated March 1. An online ad for the Karahalios campaign uses a clip from Fedeli on Global’s Focus Ontario supporting Brown’s ill-fated People’s Guarantee election platform which included a carbon tax pledge that Ford has since scrapped. “I think it’s the best platform I’ve seen in a long time and I fully endorse it…I’m so excited about it,” Fedeli told Focus Ontario host Alan Carter last January.  Karahalios also accused the party of undermining his candidacy by excluding his brochure from a bulk mailing to members before the vote at a Toronto convention Nov. 17. “They’re not running a fair, democratic race,” said Karahalios, who is concerned there are too many lobbyists and former Brown executive members running.  The same flyer that quotes Fedeli also uses blurbs taken from articles written by Star Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie and TVO’s Steve Paikin about the role Karahalios played in challenging Brown, now mayor-elect in Brampton. These appear to be presented as endorsements and include unauthorized Star and TVO photographs of the two journalists.  Both Paikin and Benzie have made it clear on Twitter that they are neutral and never endorse political candidates. “Jim has accurately quoted what I said about him. However, I was not asked for permission to appear in his brochure and obviously have never endorsed any candidate for any office EVER,” Paikin tweeted. Benzie issued a similar tweet.  “Notwithstanding the @TorontoStar’s considerable influence in the @OntarioPCParty, I am not endorsing any candidate for PC president. The unauthorized  inference in Jim Karahalios’ brochure suggests he is in a tough contest against front-runner Brian Patterson.

"Silent as a bird’s wing, mute as tarmac, shy as a baby gerbil, Premier  ’s cabinet is doing a  . They want to be alone.  Of all the emerging social inadequacies of the Ford government, the shunning of the voting public by avoiding reporters is the strangest.  Garbo was always banging on about being alone, but most famously in   a 1932 movie very much like Queen’s Park right now, a genre drama about a big place where people seek to be known and not known, where paths cross or deliberately don’t. Transportation Minister John Yakabuski, in Garbo’s role, plays the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya who wishes not to be questioned about her declining career, just as Yakabuski made clear Thursday he would not agree to an interview request from Star transportation reporter  , a meticulous and fair-minded reporter.

(  climaxes in a train station too, but in Berlin, not Mimico.) When Spurr tried to introduce himself to the transportation minister/artiste on the train platform — stranger danger! — it was time for Garbo’s big line. Yakabuski told Spurr he didn’t talk “to people who insult me on the internet.” But all Spurr could find was his comment online about Yakabuski not talking to journalists. “The minister is a powerful person, whose government controls billions of dollars of infrastructure and is proposing major changes to your transit system,” Spurr wrote. “He and his communications staff are paid by the public. I think they should answer basic questions from the public.” That’s not an insult, that is a call for basic information in a democracy. The minister also blocks the Globe and Mail’s urban transportation reporter, Oliver Moore. Normal politicians would be thrilled to talk regularly to two reporters with specialized knowledge. And reporters don’t insult, they simply report. Columnists do though, and that’s where I come in. At this point Yakabuski has abandoned Garbo and is doing   or that bit in   where George Clooney detaches himself from Sandra Bullock and floats away. Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod’s staffers applauding to drown out reporters’ questions? That’s Julia Louis-Dreyfus as shameless Vice-President Selina Meyer in  In real life, Yakabuski sounds like Sarah Huckabee Sanders who blamed CNN for always having been “so negative.” CNN had been sent a  amid President Trump labelling journalists “enemies of the people.” Ford’s government so dislikes reporters that it sends out its own version of news on a Conservative platform called Ontario News Now, with an actor (Seneca-trained former journalist Lyndsey Vanstone) playing a TV news reporter. She cheerfully offers no context, no quotes from Opposition critics or community groups, just Ford cabinet ministers congratulating each other and taking her candyfloss questions. This is news as Ford would like it. No minister will have to defend the tax money being spent — though Ford Nation voters actually care about that — or be asked awkward questions. Government is a private matter. Ford, slayer of elections, will do as he pleases. This is sinister. But Yakabuski’s stance is ludicrous, a teenage-level dating strategy to pursue voters, win, and then ghost them. One can only speculate. Is this payback for some ancient grudge he has coddled like an egg? What will my payback be for calling Yakabuski a ballerina? Here’s another way Ford veers from the norm. To succeed in politics, it’s best to be a certain kind of person: energetic, unflappable, data-minded, thick-skinned, and above all, comfortable with people.

New governments, like new bosses, are given a certain number of yes cards, in this case because the previous Liberal government had taken on an air of seedy corruption.

"Premier Doug Ford can’t put a dollar sign on the cost of new  going up at all 18 Ontario border crossings from the United States. As opposition parties complain the exercise amounts to politicking on the taxpayers’ dime given that the slogan was a key element of Ford’s spring election campaign, the premier evaded a question on the cost Tuesday and the transportation minister didn’t have a figure at hand. “We’re going to make sure the world knows and the millions of people that cross every border across Ontario that we now have a province that encourages business to open up,” Ford said in response to the query from New Democrat MPP Taras Natyshak of the Windsor-area riding of Essex. “As a matter of fact, we’re going to put a sign up right down the street from the member’s home there to make sure that people know Ontario is open for business.” Ford’s Progressive Conservatives say freezing the minimum wage at $14 — axing a slated $1 rise to $15 in January and paring the previous Liberal government’s labour reforms — along with cutting red tape will make the province more business-friendly and create more jobs. But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said the government is sending a mixed message to the business community,  and winding down Ontario’s  California and Quebec for hundreds of companies that spent millions on permits — exposing the province to potential legal action.  “After receiving criticism from the business community on that, maybe the government has to put an open for business sign because they’ve done so many things opposed to business all summer,” said Schreiner, the MPP for Guelph. “They’re actually using taxpayer money, wasting taxpayer money, on a bunch of goofy signs to promote their political slogan. I think the auditor general should absolutely investigate this.” Transportation Minister John Yakabuski said the signs will cost less than $600,000 but couldn’t provide a precise amount. He noted the signs will be made by ministry staff, not contracted out. “It’s not an easy question. We’re doing it all in-house. And we’re doing it in the most cost-effective way possible…our own staff are putting the signs up. Once the job is complete we’ll have a full understanding of exactly what it costs,” he told reporters. Yakabuski insisted there is nothing partisan about the signs because “business is what makes things go.” “Open for business is not a political slogan,” he added. “We are sending the message, we said it over and over again during the campaign, and we are repeating it now, Ontario is open for business.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she doubts Ford’s signs “are going to make one heck of a difference for anybody.” “It’s obviously a political slogan. He used it all throughout the campaign,” Horwath said. “The fact he won’t tell people how much it costs is something people need to worry about.

"The skilled trades need an upgrade. So said the provincial government in proposing major changes — contained in a labour reform bill  — that will reduce apprenticeship ratios, phase-out trades with low demand and begin the “orderly wind down” of the Ontario College of Trades, a regulatory body for the profession that was a first in North America. Training, Colleges and Universities Minister Merrilee Fullerton said getting rid of the college of trades will reduce red tape and put Ontario in line with other provinces, and along with other moves that will help open up jobs and fix a “broken” system.  “One in five jobs in the next five years will be trades-related — but there’s a problem,” Fullerton said in announcing the changes last week. “Employers can’t find apprentices, and apprentices can’t find jobs.  “Yet despite this labour shortage there are those who want careers in the skilled trades who are actually forced to leave this province to find work. They deserve a shot at a job here in Ontario.” She said Ontario’s apprenticeship ratios are “among the highest in the country and are a major deterrent for employers looking to hire apprentices.” The changes in Bill 47, the  , were lauded by a number of unions and associations, including Colleges Ontario, the Ontario Skilled Trades Alliance — representing companies that employ more than 400,000 trades workers — and the 15,000-member Power Workers’ Union.  Unifor and associations representing electrical workers, however, raised concerns about oversight and the need to maintain rigorous training and safety standards. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce has warned 82 per cent of businesses can’t find workers with the   because of a shortage and a mismatch between the skills workers have and those that employers need. It’s estimated that 560,000 jobs could go unfilled by 2030 because of that gap, costing the economy tens of billions of dollars.  The province is proposing to lower apprenticeship ratios to a simple one-to-one, down from some as high as five journeymen for each, said Fullerton. And she said the government “heard loud and clear from employers and tradespeople that the Ontario College of Trades is not delivering as it’s currently structured ... many of the roles and responsibilities are overly burdensome” — including how apprentices must be registered with both the ministry and the college of trades. Linda Franklin, president of Colleges Ontario — which represents the province’s community colleges that help provide skilled trades education — said the system “is awash in red tape. “We’re pleased the government is taking serious action to streamline and improve skills training.” But Unifor’s Ontario branch warned that the college of trades is needed “to ensure high-quality workmanship.”  Unifor, which represents 315,000 workers including those at the Toronto Star, also said the reduced ratios are “dangerously high ... (and) would dramatically decrease the time spent receiving training and could lead to apprentices working alone without any support from a journeyperson.” Associations representing electrical workers, including the Electrical Contractors Association of Ontario and the IBEW/Construction Council of Ontario, are urging the government to listen to those in the trades sector and keep training and safety standards high. Fullerton said the current trade classification system is “complicated and outdated” and the government will put a moratorium on any new categories as it conducts a review and phases out 24 low-interest trades. Those could include wooden boat rebuilder/repairer, saddlery, pool and hot tub spa service technician and swine herdsperson. The Ontario College of Trades was seen as a way to regulate and promote the trades, though critics said it was an unnecessary level of bureaucracy.

Brett Moore told reporters at the scene the man was crossing St. Clair Ave. E. at Jeanette St.  A black Chrysler minivan travelling east on St. Clair Ave. E. in the left lane struck the man, fleeing the scene shortly after, police said. A black ball cap could be seen on the road beside an evidence marker near the crosswalk. In a news release, police said they responded to a call at 7:09 a.m. Emergency services found the victim without vital signs. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Moore said the driver was last seen heading eastbound on St. Clair.  Police said the passenger-side mirror of the minivan was left behind at the scene and confirmed it as a Chrysler part. The vehicle is also believed to be damaged on the passenger side.  “Get yourself a lawyer, do the right thing and come forward,” Moore said in an appeal to the driver. A portion of St. Clair Ave. E. was closed, from the scene of the incident to Midland Ave.  Several TTC vehicles were rerouted. The TTC said Routes 9, 102 and 902 are detoured via Midland Ave., Kingston Rd. and Waltonice Rd. Police said all roads re-opened at around noon.  Police said seized video shows there were several motorists in the area who may have seen the collision.  Moore told reporters police have recovered surveillance video from residents near the scene, and are calling on neighbours who have camera systems to come forward with information, “even if it’s something small.”  They are also seeking dash cameras from anyone who was in the area. Police are asking anybody with information to contact them at 416-808-1900. Four cyclists and 28 pedestrians have been killed on Toronto streets so far this year, according to figures compiled by the Star. The combined total of 32 cyclist and pedestrian deaths this year is the highest by this date in any year since 2007. In 2015, there were 31 pedestrian and cyclist deaths as of Sept. 26. The Star’s traffic fatality numbers are higher than the official police count. That’s in part because Toronto police figures don’t include deadly collisions that happen on private property, such as in the parking lots of apartment buildings or malls, or on provincial 400-series highways within Toronto.

"A hit-and-run has left a 44-year-old man in life-threatening condition in Markham,York Regional Police say.  At 9:45 p.m. on Saturday night, police responded to a call on Birchmount Road and Royal Crest Court in Markham after they received reports of a man who had been struck by a vehicle. Police found a man in “very serious” condition. Paramedics confirmed that when they arrived the victim had no vital signs. He was transported to hospital where he remains in life-threatening condition, York Regional Police duty inspector Peter Casey said. Casey says the incident was also a “fail to remain.” After hitting a pedestrian, the driver fled the scene, and was last seen driving north on Birchmount Road. Police have released a possible description of the vehicle, and are looking for a mid-size, light-grey SUV. They say the vehicle would have fresh, front-end damage.  Birchmount was closed for the initial investigation, but reopened shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday morning.  ",0,Markham man in life-threatening condition after hit-and-run

"A man has been killed after being struck by a vehicle in Mississauga Friday morning. Peel Regional Police were called to the area of Derry Rd. W. and Hurontario St. shortly before 6 a.m. A pickup truck travelling southbound on Hurontario St. had struck a pedestrian, who sustained life-threatening injuries. He was pronounced dead on scene by paramedics not long after emergency services arrived.  Const. Sarah Patten said the man had stepped out into the road to attempt to cross it just south of the intersection, in an area where “there was no crosswalk.” The driver of the pickup truck was the one who called police after stopping his vehicle, she said. The driver is co-operating with police and has remained on scene. No charges have been laid, and Patten said it’s not yet known whether any will be. “It sounds like, at this point, that the driver may have just not seen him,” she said. “Nothing has been confirmed yet.” The Major Collisions Bureau is investigating.  Police asked for the public to avoid the area. Hurontario St. is closed between Topflight Dr. and Admiral Blvd., and Derry Rd. is closed from Derrycrest Dr. to Edwards Blvd. for the investigation.

"A cyclist is dead following a collision on Hwy. 404, just south of Davis Drive in Newmarket. All southbound lanes of the highway are closed as OPP investigates the fatal collision, according to Sgt. Kerry Schmidt. The lanes are expected to remain closed for several hours. “There is little I can tell you about the collision except for that a cyclist is dead,” he said in a video update on Periscope. Northbound lanes are open, but there is a visual distraction. Schmidt advised motorists to avoid the area. If travelling southbound on the highway, drivers will be forced off at Davis Drive. “For those stuck in the closure, please wait for police direction to get turned around and safely off the highway,” he said. “It may be some time until that happens, since OPP just arrived on scene.” MTO is currently assisting with the highway closure.

A 72 year-old male cyclist from Scarborough was killed in an afternoon collision as he attempted to cross the southbound lanes on Hwy. 404, near Davis Dr. in Newmarket. “He got across the middle lane where vehicles swerved to avoid him,” OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said in an update. He said a white pickup truck that was in the far left lane was unable to avoid a collision. Two female and one male cyclist were also injured in traffic incidents in Toronto. Around 10 a.m., police responded to a collision involving a cyclist and a truck in the area of Keele St. and Steeles Ave. They found the victim, an 18-year-old woman, and rushed her to hospital with life-threatening injuries. The driver of the truck remained on the scene after the collision. In the downtown core, a female cyclist was taken to hospital after she was hit by a bus shortly after noon. Police responded to the collision at Bay and Wellington Sts. and found the victim with non-life-threatening injuries. Police say initial reports indicated she was underneath the bus. Photos from the scene show a badly damaged bicycle next to a white bus. Police, paramedics and Toronto Fire were at the scene. Shortly before 2 p.m., paramedics were called to a collision at Midland and Steeles Aves. and found the victim, a male cyclist in his 60s, lying on the ground.

"A woman has been killed after being struck by a vehicle while she was riding a mobility scooter in south Etobicoke. Police were called to the area of Sixth St. and Lake Shore Blvd. W. for a reported collision, and found a woman between 60 and 70 years old who had been hit by a vehicle.  She was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, where she later was pronounced dead. Police initially thought that she had been on an e-bike, but the investigation found that it was a mobility scooter.  The driver of the vehicle remained on scene to co-operate with police.  Rene Noel, who walked past the scene of the collision shortly after it occurred, said what looked like a “smashed up mobility scooter” was lying in the road, a short distance away from a vehicle Noel described as a “somewhat rare Mercedes.”  The sun was very low at the time, Noel said, and “often is directly in the eyes of westbound traffic at this time of day.” Noel added that across the street is Konrad Lounge, a popular bar and grill, and that it’s not uncommon to see people travelling back and forth from that establishment and the nearby New Toronto Senior Centre, at Lake Shore Blvd. W. and Fourth St.  Police are still investigating the circumstances of the collision, and have not yet confirmed what happened.  The intersection was closed down for the investigation.  ",0,Woman on mobility scooter killed after being struck by vehicle in south Etobicoke
"Road safety activists are calling on the city to answer why their concerns over “death trap” cycling conditions in the west end have gone unaddressed. Members of   gave Metroland Media a tour of what they say are problematic areas that won’t require much money or resources to improve. And yet, there hasn’t been much movement to make such locations safer for non-motorists, they say. “City staff and councillors know of the issues, they’ve been on their list for the last 2-3 years,” said  . “It’s been agonizingly slow waiting for them to make improvements.” One of Nogami’s current concerns is at the intersection of Lake Shore Blvd. and Ellis Ave., where there’s   — but no direct way to get to it without encountering speeding cars. Nogami says he and fellow Ward 13 advocates beseeched city staff and decision-makers to address the conditions of the area — just west of Colborne Lodge Dr. where cyclist Jonas Mitchell was  The location has a signalized two-stage crosswalk on the west side of the intersection but nothing, not even a coat of paint, to denote a crossing on the east side.  More problematic is a tiny traffic island at the intersection that is barely large enough for a couple of bikes and a stroller, crowded by a right-turn lane for motorists to easily access Lake Shore.  “It’s a death trap,” said Nogami of the island. Improvements are coming to Ellis, eventually, with a short stretch of bike lanes planned for the underpass. Ellis already is a signed cycling route since it already has sharrows, which are painted lane markings. But the speed of change, local Councillor Sarah Doucette says, is not anywhere near fast enough. Doucette says she and her staff keep a spreadsheet tracking problem areas. In the case of a new crossing point for Ellis and Lake Shore, she promises changes are coming this year, but even with construction season down to its last few months she can’t say exactly when. The traffic island is another story. It’s supposed to be converted into a wider sidewalk, paid for through Section 37 funding from the developer of a planned residential tower at 2002 Lake Shore.  But with construction not yet approved, Doucette — who on Wednesday announced   — has asked city staff to include the expense of converting the traffic island in next year’s municipal budget. “It’s frustrating, believe me, said Doucette. “We’re not waiting any longer. It’s been far too long.” In the Junction, Ward 13 members Helen Qu and Robert Zaichkowski cautiously cycle through the underpass at Bloor St. and Dundas Ave. W., a terrifying act at times for anyone on two wheels. In addition to the speeding motorists, and poor visibility, there are plenty of potholes to navigate.  “Most of the time, you look straight and hope for the best, because you can’t control what’s happening behind you,” said Qu.  The presence of parked cars presents a major safety concern as the roads get narrower further west. “By the time you hit Lansdowne (Ave.) you have to take the (vehicular) lane, otherwise you’ll get doored,” said Zaichkowski. Gil Penalosa isn’t surprised at the lack of movement on improving road safety.  Even with recent approvals to increase funding for the city’s Vision Zero road safety plan, Penalosa,   frequently critical of the city’s direction on the issue, said the money committed, currently some $100 million over the next five years, pales in comparison to other cities.  “In New York City, they’re spending $38 per person (for Vision Zero), in Toronto it’s $6,” said Penalosa. “That’s not nearly enough.” Money is not the main issue, however, according to Penalosa. It’s political will, or the lack thereof, coming from Toronto decision-makers. “There is a crisis on our streets and we’re only talking about it,” said Penalosa.

"A local doctors group launched a campaign on Thursday urging municipal candidates in the upcoming election to commit to road safety initiatives. “The tragedies involving people who ride a bicycle need to stop,” Dr. Samantha Green, co-founder of Doctors for Safe Cycling, said in a news release. “Fortunately we have a prescription that can bring relief.” The self-proclaimed non-partisan campaign has been named Doctors’ Prescription for Road Safety. The organization has called on candidates to commit to lower existing speed limits and to build more protected bike lanes across the city. The release added that the lanes should physically separate cyclists and drivers. “This is not about drivers versus cyclists,” Dr. Jillian Baker, a member of the campaign, said. “This is about making our roads safer for everyone.” Baker appears in a video that the organization will be circulating to political hopefuls, featuring physicians explaining their recommendations to the specific candidates. In the news release, the doctors group cited a July Ekos poll, apparently showing that 75 per cent of Toronto drivers support bike lanes. They added that the first step in the bike lane extension would be to build new lanes on Yonge St. and Danforth Ave., and extending the existing ones on Bloor St. “The solutions are out there and proven as well, it’s not a question,” said Green. “We know that it works and it works better than public education or getting people to wear bike helmets.” “Bike helmets don’t actually prevent the collisions from occuring, we want to prevent the collisions.” Toronto has seen a rash of pedestrian and cyclist deaths over the summer, including , a 58-year-old grandmother who died when a flatbed truck collided with her bicycle at Bloor St. W. and St. George Sts. in June. “These thoroughfares already have many cyclists,” Green said. “Imagine how many more we’d have if we added protected lanes and made Yonge and Danforth really safe.” Chako’s death renewed calls for better cyclist safety in the city. In August, Mayor John Tory announced  within Vision Zero, a two-year-old plan to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2021.

"Two people are dead and 12 others are injured after a shooting rampage Sunday night on Danforth Ave.  The suspected gunman is also dead, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said. Saunders confirmed Sunday night that a young woman was killed and a girl was critically injured by gunfire on the busy Greektown strip. All the injured victims had been taken to hospitals for treatment, he said. The slain woman was identified Monday afternoon by other media as Reese Fallon, 18, who lived in Toronto’s Beach neighbourhood.  “She was full of passion and she cared about making a difference in the world, and this is a huge loss,” Beaches—East York MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith told the Star, speaking on behalf of Fallon’s family outside their home. “Reese was a wonderful young woman. She was full of energy. She was whip smart,” Erskine-Smith said, though he would not confirm she was killed in the shooting.  “You see violence in the city but certainly in safe places in our community, on the Danforth where this happened, you certainly never expect to see something like this,” he said, adding that Fallon’s family has requested privacy.  In an update Monday, police confirmed that the 10-year-old girl who was critically injured had died. Police said 16 people were shot in total, including the 29-year-old gunman. The victims ranged in age from 10 to 59 years old, police said. Speaking to media at the scene on Sunday night, Saunders said there was an “exchange of gunfire” and that the shooter had used a handgun. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged attacker had been killed by police or by self-inflicted gunshots.  The Special Investigations Unit, which probes deaths or serious injuries involving police, was on the scene early Monday morning.  Saunders said there was no information yet on the timeline of the shooting or any possible motive.  Witnesses described a man dressed in black, with a black hat, firing about 20 shots in the area. The scene extended over several blocks, roughly between Chester and Logan Aves.  Paramedics said multiple people were taken to hospitals and trauma centres, including the child who was transported to the Hospital for Sick Children. Toronto Fire was called to the scene at 10:04 p.m., and requested additional ambulance support. Emergency Task Force officers arrived and began to cordon off several blocks. Police also confirmed that a suspicious package was being investigated.  Stavy Karnouskou was standing with a few friends outside Logo bar on the south side of Danforth, east of Logan Ave. “I heard ‘pop, pop’ and then I turned because I thought it was fireworks  … and then the mother of a friend of mine goes, ‘They’re shooting at us — run inside!’” Karnouskou said. Karnouskou got a frantic call from her sister, who lives in a nearby apartment, worried because she couldn’t locate her fiancé. Karnouskou peered out and saw victims on the opposite sidewalk, both of whom appeared to be female. About 10 minutes after the gunfire, Karnouskou went outside and saw two women on the ground, with bystanders trying to save them by doing chest compressions. “One of them, I could see her legs were blue,” Karnouskou said, her voice trembling as she put her hand over her mouth. “I wanted to help her but didn’t know what to do.” She also saw a man who had been shot, lying on the patio of Lukumum bakery and café, also on the north side, east of Logan Ave. Karnouskou said another man was trying to help him. Karnouskou said it felt like at least 10 minutes before firefighters arrived, and she and others were upset that police didn’t get there sooner.  “I’ve lived on the Danforth for the last four years and there is always a police car around,” she said. “If there was a police car around this area, he wouldn’t have been shooting that long.”  Michael Kozaris was working inside Mezes restaurant, on the north side of Danforth, west of Logan, when he heard “pops.” “I thought maybe fireworks, but the restaurant is noisy so I don’t think too much. But after the 10th shot, I think, ‘OK, something’s happening,’ and I see people at the patio jump up. “A co-worker says, ‘It’s not bullets’ and goes outside to check and is standing there. We can hear shots but we can’t see anything,” Kozaris said. “Another co-worker, Nick, a waiter, tells him to come in and grabs him and we hear two more bangs. And Nick goes, ‘F-, he shot me. Call 911, call an ambulance.’ And he’s got blood pouring off his hand. We think it was a ricochet off the door handle.” Kozaris said he called 911 and was on hold for several minutes before someone ran outside to grab a police officer. The officer, he said, told his co-worker that an ambulance would come but he’d have to wait. “Nick is losing blood. It’s everywhere, and he’s starting to pass out,” Kozaris said, so a friend drove him to nearby Michael Garron Hospital.  Kozaris said the last he’d heard was that his co-worker was being X-rayed and that they thought the bullet was still in his hand. Another witness, Lenny Graf, was with his wife, his 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter having dinner at Christina’s restaurant, near Logan Ave., when the kids asked to go play at the fountain in Alexander the Great parkette. Graf went along, and when he got outside he heard loud popping sounds. “I thought it was firecrackers, except that people started to run away and crouch down and scream,” Graf said. He looked up and realized his son was crouched down near the fountain, about 10 feet from the shooter. He frantically looked for his daughter, who he later learned ran back into the restaurant. “I crouched a bit, and then I thought, OK, what do I do? I crouch down, I get shot? I run, I get shot?” The gunman, who was dressed all in black, was on the sidewalk on the north side of Danforth, near the fountain, Graf said. “I saw him finish shooting some people and then walk away,” he said. The gunman appeared to be shooting at random, like someone “in a video game.” “He was very relaxed. It was pretty disturbing,” Graf said. “I always thought if I was up against a guy shooting people, I would run up and grab the gun or something, but there was no way to do that.” Graf said the gunman continued walking west on Danforth. Graf worried he would come back, so he grabbed his son and pulled him into an alley. They went into the Friendly Greek restaurant through a back door.  There, he found his wife and daughter, who had also run into the restaurant for safety. Graf said he remembers seeing someone on the ground, then seeing paramedics and police arrive. Jessica Young, an employee at Second Cup, further west near Chester subway station, said she saw the alleged attacker: “I look to my side and see the shooter through the window. He sees me, or he sees my co-worker or someone, and points the gun and shoots through the window.”  No one inside the café was injured, she said. “He was probably no taller than me, wearing a black baseball cap, dark clothes. He had light skin. I think he had short facial hair. That’s all I could make out,” Young said, adding that the suspect appeared to have a pistol or handgun. “I was shaken, terrified. It’s not every day you almost get shot,” she said. Another woman who spoke to the Star said she was driving with friends eastbound on Danforth when she heard gunfire. The woman, who did not wish to provide her name, said she turned to see a man dressed in black, shooting directly into one of the stores on the north side.  “The glass had been broken and there were multiple shots — I would say around eight,” she said. “… He was aiming very directly with his legs open in a sort of stance.”  Video footage and photos posted online by bystanders appeared to show a man who matched descriptions of the shooter walking west along the sidewalk on the north side of Danforth Ave., east of Chester Ave., and firing into a storefront. The man was wearing a black ballcap and appeared to be carrying some type of bag.  A woman who gave her name only as Helen K saw police arriving while driving east on Danforth. She walked to the north side of the street and saw two women severely injured on the ground. She said they both appeared to be in their 20s and people were trying to resuscitate them. She saw a man lying injured on the patio of the nearby bakery, amid overturned chairs. “I was trying to calm down a woman who was trying to find her daughter, who texted her that she was hiding in a bathroom,” Helen said, adding she can’t believe anything so horrific happened in Greektown. “On the Danforth? Everyone knows the Danforth, right? It’s safe. I don’t think anything like this has happened here.  Now I don’t know what’s going to happen. It could happen anywhere.” A woman named Diana interviewed by CP24 said she had been working at Demetres café, just east of Chester Ave., where she was serving a family that included the girl who was shot. She said she saw a gunman aim at the restaurant and heard him fire about three shots through the patio doors.  A woman who gave her name only as Mary said she was in Pantheon restaurant, on the south side of Danforth Ave., when she saw a young girl being placed on a stretcher and taken into an ambulance. Gaylene Edmonson was sitting in her backyard nearby when she heard the first shot ring out. “I first heard it and thought it was a gunshot, because I’m paranoid about that sort of stuff,” she said, but she convinced herself at first that it was a firecracker. Edmonson believes she heard 15 to 20 gunshots that sounded as though they were moving away from her home. John Tulloch said he and his brother had just got out of their car on Danforth when he heard about 20 to 30 gunshots.  “We just ran. We saw people starting to run, so we just ran,” he said. Mayor John Tory, who was on the scene Sunday night, offered his condolences to families of the victims and urged residents not to jump to conclusions about what transpired and why.  In a statement, Tory called the shooting a “despicable act” and thanked first responders who had rushed to aid the victims.  “On behalf of all Toronto residents, I am outraged that someone has unleashed such a terrible attack on our city and people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening,” Tory said.  “... While our city will always be resilient in the face of such attacks, it does not mean such a cowardly act committed against our residents is any less painful — this is an attack against innocent families and our entire city,” Tory said. : For the day’s top news from the Star’s award-winning journalists,  .

"An evening out at a restaurant on the Danforth should have been a relaxing night for Danielle Kane and her boyfriend.  Then gunman Faisal Hussain opened fire on the family-friendly street, killing 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and 18-year-old Reese Fallon, and injuring 13 others.  Kane is one of those victims. The 31-year-old nursing student was shot in the spine as she and her boyfriend, nurse Jerry Pinksen, rushed out of a popular Italian restaurant, determined to help any way they could. A bullet struck and shattered Kane’s T11 vertebrae, puncturing her diaphragm and stomach.  She is gradually coming out of a medically induced coma, but the full extent of her injuries is not yet known, Pinksen said Tuesday. “Doctors said that worst-case scenario, she’s in a wheelchair with the use of her arms and torso, and best-case scenario she’s going to be walking with an aid or a walker of some sort,” said Pinksen, 35, who has been with Kane for nearly two years. “I’ve been through some emotional distress, but Danielle right now is suffering from potentially a lifelong deficit, so I want to make sure that people recognize how selfless she was, trying to race out there and help someone, not knowing what we were going to meet outside the door.” In the days following the shooting, Kane has undergone at least four surgeries.  Friends and family   to fundraise for her fight ahead and have raised more than $160,000 as of Tuesday evening.  Pinksen said he’s “floored” by the outpouring of support. “I never thought (the campaign) would get so many people, from all across Canada, from my hometown.” On the night of July 22, Kane and Pinksen were inside 7Numbers Italian restaurant, treating a friend to dinner, when they heard 10 or 12 shots ring out.  A woman ran into the restaurant saying someone had been shot. Pinksen sprung from the table and rushed to help an injured woman. An ER nurse, he felt it was his duty to jump into the scene.  Kane followed close behind. “Those compassionate, selfless tendencies, they’re why we fell in love, and that’s why we’re together right now,” said Pinksen, who works at Michael Garron Hospital on Coxwell Ave., not far from the site of the shooting. Pinksen said he made eye contact with the shooter before hearing a click. He dove behind a patio table, then heard a scream.  Kane had been hit. Pinksen brought her inside and began administering first aid until first responders arrived.  “She said it was the most pain she had ever experienced and she couldn’t feel her legs,” he said. Kane, who studies nursing at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, was set to start her second year of school in September. Pinksen said it was instinct for his girlfriend to help others. “She’s so compassionate,” he said, noting that her goal after school was to become an advocate for marginalized people, including the homeless and those struggling with mental health and addiction.  “That was what she was driven to, to help support those people — give those people a voice. She’s always there to help.”  Kane was conscious until she went into surgery the morning after the shooting, and has been under sedation and on a ventilator since then, Pinksen said. Over the past three to four days, doctors have been trying to ease Kane off the breathing machine, slowly reducing her sedation so she can breathe on her own and follow commands, he said.  “She’s still very agitated and we don’t know what she’s thinking or what she is working through,” Pinksen said. Once she is well enough, Kane will begin rehabilitation, and Pinksen said he plans to be by her side the whole way. “I want to make sure I am going to provide the life for her that she has the least amount of barriers, so that she can keep her autonomy and be an independent woman like she was before this tragic event,” he said. Pinksen said that he was wracked with guilt because his decision to help the victim outside led Kane into danger. “I realized that she’s a caring, professional woman, and she wouldn’t have listened to me anyways,” he said.  “She was out there no matter what. I didn’t even think about it — I was rushing out — and she was rushing out right behind me.”  Pinksen called Kane “selfless” in her actions. “She wouldn’t think that she needs recognition, she wouldn’t think she’s deserving of it,” he said. “I just want to make sure that she has the support she needs.” ",0,"Danforth victim coming out of coma but may never walk again, boyfriend says"

The parents, both of Greek heritage, grew up “within 50 feet of each other,” in his ward, he said. “This is really close to home,” he added. “They’re wonderful families.” Karygiannis tried to reach another family member to give his condolences but instead heard the voice of a young girl on the answering machine. “It broke my heart,” he said. The Markham Synchro Club said Julianna had been one of its artistic swimmers. “Julianna was a beautiful, aspiring athlete who was in her third year in our sport,” the club said in a statement. “This is a traumatic event for many of us and we are committed to working through this in a thoughtful and responsive manner.” The York Region District School Board declined to confirm whether Julianna was a student, but board Director Louise Sirisko issued a statement saying the tragedy on the Danforth hit close to home. “There are few words to adequately express the depth of sorrow that we feel,” she said in the statement. “Senseless acts of violence like these leave an imprint on our communities and weigh heavy on our hearts. We join families and communities in grieving for all those affected by this terrible incident.” One of Donny Kozis’ high school friends   on Wednesday to raise money to support the family. In a statement, the city of Markham said it will lower flags in Julianna’s memory and in remembrance of other victims of the shooting. On Monday, no one answered the door at the Kozis family’s Markham home. The white-painted garage door of the grey brick house was closed, with one grey sedan parked on the double driveway. Next-door neighbour Krishni Selvarajah, Vaneesha’s mother, said she has known the Kozis family for more than 10 years. “We talk to them all the time and hang out every now and then,” she said. “They’re an amazing family. Very wonderful people.” Derrick Pinto, who has lived across the street for the past eight years, described the family as welcoming and friendly. “She was out here playing with her younger brother and other kids this weekend,” he said, calling the news “heartbreaking.” Arlene Kameka, another next-door neighbour, said it was terrible to find out there was yet another shooting in the city.  “Now to find out it happened to a friend next door? It’s so horrific,” she said. Eighteen-year-old Reese Fallon of Toronto  . Thirteen others were injured. , Faisal Hussain, died following an exchange of gunfire with police. Police sources have said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In a statement issued Monday, Hussain’s family said he suffered from “severe mental health challenges” and struggled with psychosis and depression. The motive of Sunday night’s mass shooting is not known. Toronto police continue to investigate the shooting, while the Special Investigations Unit continues its probe of Hussain’s death. On Wednesday, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders refuted claims from the Daesh terrorist group that said the shooter was one of its “soldiers.” Saunders said his force was investigating Sunday’s violence from every angle and had found nothing to indicate a connection to the group, also known and ISIS and ISIL.

"She lowered herself onto the ground and, clutching a stick of chalk, scrawled “Tana Tana Tana” on the sidewalk. Then, the girl with the bandaged knees, fresh blood leaking through the thick, white gauze, stood up and repositioned herself about a foot away. This time she wrote “fried chicken” in bold, white letters.  Fried chicken was “her favourite thing,” the girl said of her friend Reese Fallon, to two others standing nearby. Fallon, 18, was killed Sunday when a lone gunman opened fire on groups of people enjoying a summer’s night on  . The girl with the bandaged knees, along with a clutch of others, spent more than an hour outside Malvern Collegiate Institute Tuesday afternoon, chatting, hugging and writing messages in chalk.  The “Tana Tana Tana” was an ode to another facet of Fallon’s cultural repertoire — a popular YouTube star.  Malvern Collegiate, Fallon’s alma mater, opened for the day to offer support, comfort and counselling to the friends, faculty and staff she left behind. The school’s library became a hub for mourners to meet with social workers and pat therapy dogs. Outside the school, teenagers, visibly shaken, sobbed and embraced. Some placed flower bouquets at the base of the flag that was flying at half-mast. Others left notes. One message, printed on red paper, said: “The world was a better place with you in it. We will carry you in our hearts forever. Shine bright beautiful.” Another message printed on the sidewalk in neat, bold lettering nearly spanned the length of the school. It read: “Love for all hatred for none”  Misty Saha, 17, a recent graduate in Fallon’s class, looked as if she had been crying.  She was supposed to be at the same dinner as Fallon on Sunday night, a celebration of a friend’s birthday, she said. The group was supposed to go for ice cream, but she couldn’t attend because she was out of town.  It wasn’t until the next day that Saha found out about the night’s tragic end, she said. And then, she could barely “process what was going on.”  “It could have been me, it could have been anybody else,” she said. Calling her friend “charismatic,” Saha said she and Fallon became close while working together on the prom committee.  They bonded over a shared desire to work with children. “Our personalities were pretty much alike,” said Saha, who will attend Queen’s University in the fall. Fallon wanted to be a “child’s nurse,” she said, and was eager to start her degree at McMaster University.  Mark Steel, 39, a Malvern chemistry teacher who taught Fallon, was among those who came to find comfort Tuesday in the school’s community. His wife set up a   page hours after learning of Fallon’s death. The goal is that the money earned will, each year, go to a Malvern graduate who embodies Fallon’s qualities and is entering a nursing program, he said.  Steel, who himself donated $500 to the GoFundMe campaign, said Fallon worked hard and pushed herself. “We thought a scholarship would be a good idea to keep her memory going.”  Anthony Parise, a Malvern English teacher who also taught Fallon, stood among the students outside the school. He said that like the others, he too was struggling to understand the senseless violence. All at once, he said, the community was thinking about Fallon and the positive impact she had on all of them. And then, he said, “there’s this horrible feeling of loss and the unthinkable nature of how she was lost.” Students in the McMaster Nursing class of 2022, in which Fallon was enrolled, plan to memorialize Fallon’s life as they begin the next school year. They’re encouraging their fellow students to wear red bandanas on their arm through welcome week “to commemorate Reese’s presence on campus,” one student said in a Facebook group for McMaster students. They’re calling the plan #RedforReese. “When we received word that Reese was the victim of such senseless violence, we all felt called to do something to honour her. Her opportunity to even start studies at McMaster was stolen from her, and we knew we needed to acknowledge her presence in the program,” said McMaster nursing student Mandy Lau on Wednesday.  “We hope that we can see a sea of red bandanas during welcome week, regardless of what faculty the student is from,” she said.

"Jeewan Gill said he bought tickets for Saturday’s concert in Toronto — to support victims of last month’s   — as soon as they became available. “I’m a big fan of (Billy Talent), they always put together benefit concerts,” said Gill, 26. “It’s good to support people that need help because of the shooting.” The benefit show at the Danforth Music Hall will indeed be headlined by Canadian rock band Billy Talent, with musicians City and Colour, Pup, and some other unannounced artists on the bill. The fundraiser is being held in the same neighbourhood where 18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis were killed and 13 others were injured on July 22, when a gunman fired into crowded restaurants and patios. Gill moved to Toronto from Vancouver a year ago, and said he’s been spending a lot of time on Danforth Avenue checking out its restaurants and music venues. He noted that tonight’s show will be his fifth Billy Talent concert, but he said that given the venue, and the cause, this one will be a singular event. “There will be a moment... where they talk about the shooting and what the cause is, there will be a moment of sombreness, but they’ve always been really positive when it comes to that sort of thing,” said Gill, adding that it will be a “stick together” vibe at the venue. Tickets were around $50 and the venue that seats 1,500 is sold out. Proceeds from the show will be donated to the #TorontoStrong fund. Voula Papadopoulos will also be at the show. She said she and her family and friends are regulars on the Danforth and that the shooting has shaken the community. “What happened is just unimaginable to happen anywhere ... everybody in the community is so friendly, so it hit so hard. It could have happened to any of us.” Papadopoulos said she’s also a huge Billy Talent fan, so attending the concert was an easy decision. “The fact that the guys are putting this on is just amazing on it’s own. It’s exactly what we need to show, we’re not scared, and we will support this, we’re not going to back down,” she said. Billy Talent said in a statement when the fundraiser was announced that the shooting “hit home” as it happened just a few blocks from their studio. “We want to throw a concert to show the world and more importantly our community that Toronto is a place of love, of community, of kindness and compassion. The violence that has happened here this summer does not represent the majority.” The annual Taste of the Danforth Festival is also on this weekend, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend the event celebrating the popular neighbourhood’s many restaurants and diverse food and drink offerings. Justin Trudeau was in Toronto last night to help open the festival. The prime minister began his address by honouring the victims of Friday’s shooting in Fredericton. He then offered thanks to the first responders and others who aided the victims of the Toronto shooting. ",0,Billy Talent fans glad to show support after shootings with Danforth benefit concert
"For some time now, I have been writing about automobile debuts and road tests. It’s time for a few good rants. Here goes. First, we’re going to talk about the Gardiner. Toronto mayoral candidate Jennifer Keesmaat said that, if elected, she would tear down the eastern end of the expressway at Jarvis St. and create something called a Grand Boulevard. Mayor John Tory said council had already debated and voted and they would keep the expressway above ground but take it down, straighten it, and rebuild it.  It is going to cost a lot of money. The question becomes: where will the money come from?  In a matter of days, the latest price tag for the Scarborough subway is going to come in and it will knock everybody’s socks off. Tory, re-elected earlier this week, made affordable housing promises, transit promises and now says a priority is going to be something called the Rail Deck Park. We’re talking, when you add everything up, about billions and billions of dollars. Something has got to give. My hunch — and it’s just that, a hunch — is that the Gardiner plan will be sacrificed. Tory’s excuse will be that it will be far cheaper to tear it down and leave it down than to redesign and reconstruct it. Sure, it will be a broken promise but when it comes to politics and politicians, what else is new? Oh, and if the eastern portion comes down, it’s only a matter of time before maintenance costs become so prohibitive that the rest of the expressway will have to be demolished too.  I happen to think it’s critical for the Gardiner to remain. Some people might not like the car, but tens of thousands of people are moving into the GTA each and every year, and half of them have — or will have — cars and there have to be roads where those cars can go.  And as   said a few weeks ago, the DVP, Gardiner, 427 and 401 connect with each other to make a Beltway around the city. If you take out a portion of that Beltway, the flow will be interrupted and chaos will ensue. Montreal, as it is with bicycles and their subway, is eons ahead of Toronto and the GTA when it comes to highway planning, design and construction. They made a plan and they stuck with it. In retrospect, the decision to kill the Spadina Expressway in the early 1970s (which resulted in the death knell for the Scarborough Expressway, among others) was misguided. It stopped, in its tracks, a grand transportation plan that would have done nothing but benefit the city and suburbs. Instead, it’s gummed up the works totally.  So the Gardiner has to continue operating or a critically bad situation now will only become worse and worse. How to pay for it, then? Tory has to go back to the premier of Ontario — there’s a new one, you know — and make the case for tolls. But he has to do it in a way that the new guy, Doug Ford, will accept. Tory has to convince Ford that money from the tolls will be used for one thing and one thing only — maintenance and the redesign/reconstruction of the Gardiner. The money will not go into transit, or general revenues; the money will only go toward saving the Gardiner, period, And there will be none of this taking advantage of vehicles coming in from the 905, either. The westbound Gardiner is as jammed in the morning as the eastbound because people living in the city and working in Mississauga and Hamilton are using it too. So the tolls have to be paid by every vehicle using that road. The 407 system of collection can easily be installed at every entrance and exit and they could start doing this almost immediately. I know Ford doesn’t like taxes. Neither do I. But there’s something else: I don’t want to pay to fix Toronto’s transit mess.  Where I live, I pay more in municipal taxes than do homeowners who live in Toronto. You can look it up. Until something happens to correct that, I am not particularly interested in helping out.  That’s why I say that in order to save the Gardiner, those of us who don’t live in the city but who use it will have to pitch in. A designated tax might do the trick. Otherwise, it will come down and be gone forever and the people who drive cars will really be up the creek. . Don’t believe me? Drive over to Lawrence Ave. and Allen Road on a Saturday afternoon and try to go south. It’s impossible. That’s what happened as the result of the Spadina cancellation and the same fate awaits motorists if the Gardiner should ever disappear.  During the recent elections, we heard plenty from one mayoral candidate, Jennifer Keesmaat, about road safety in general and safe intersections in particular. She said she would bring design elements into play that would do the trick at the intersections and the number of injuries and deaths would soon be down to zero.  I have a better idea. It will be cheaper — “design elements” always cost money — and be just as effective.  In short, only one thing should be happening at intersections at any one time. Right now, it’s the wild west. Cars are going through the intersection when the light is green, there are cars waiting to make left turns, some cars are trying to turn right on a red (unless specifically prohibited) and pedestrians are trying to go from one side of the street to the other.  That scenario is playing out all the time these days and it’s a disaster waiting to happen. So put a stop to it. Start by prohibiting all right turns on red. For traffic going north and south, have advance greens for 30 seconds and the only traffic moving should be cars turning left. Have greens on for through traffic for 45 seconds or even up to a minute and allow right turns but no left turns. Pedestrian walk signals would then be on for a minute and only pedestrians would be allowed on the road. No traffic would move. Repeat for traffic going east-west.  I should be an urban planner. A year ago July, I was in Europe with Mercedes-Benz. I was covering the debut of the Mercedes E-Class Cabriolet and during the drive (you always get to drive brand new cars on trips like those) we passed through the nearly 19-kilometre-long Mont Blanc Tunnel that connects France and Italy. The tunnel goes under the highest mountain in the Alps and chops off anywhere from 30 to 60 kilometres from the distance required to move goods between Italy and the rest of Europe. The speed limit is between 50 and 70 km/h and vehicles must remain 50 metres apart. That relatively slow speed and the distance apart allows maintenance personnel to move back and forth from one side of the tunnel to the other. Although you can’t see them all that well, there’s no mistaking that they’re crossing the road in front of you because they all have reflective tape on their boots and the bottoms of their trousers below the knee and the beam from a car’s headlights makes that tape shine brightly. As a result, there is no doubt there is a person on the road. I was reminded of Mont Blanc and the reflective tape the other morning when I pulled up at a major intersection near where I live. It was early — just after 6 a.m. — and it was dark. I was waiting to turn left and I noticed a person — a young woman, I believe — waiting to walk across the same intersection. She was dressed all in black — or what seemed to be black. She could have been wearing a red coat, or one coloured navy blue. But it looked black. When the light changed, she started to walk and I drove halfway across and waited for her to clear before I completed my turn. Although that intersection is lit up, it is not lit up that well. I had seen the person leave the curb but then she just seemed to disappear. Suddenly, she reappeared in my vision as she dashed across the road in front of me. My wife, who was in our vehicle with me, said the person had dropped something and went back a few steps to retrieve it and then ran the rest of the way across. I would not have moved until I made sure I knew where she was but, boy, when it’s pitch dark (or almost) at six in the morning and someone is dressed all in black, THEY ARE HARD TO SEE. Most police and other first responders, tow-truck operators, construction workers — in fact, just about anybody required to be out on the road these days, particularly when it’s dark — are required to wear outer clothing called High Visibility Safety Apparel that sticks out like a sore thumb. But that outer clothing makes people visible. You know they are there. There is no doubt. I urge anybody walking their dog, or walking to work, or to the TTC or the GO train early in the morning or late in the afternoon when it’s dark or nearly dark to put something reflective either on or over their outer clothing. It might not be fashionable but who cares at those hours? Once you’re safely back home, or in the office, or on the train platform — wherever there aren’t cars — you can take whatever-it-is off, fold it up and put it in your knapsack, purse or pocket.  Daylight Saving Time is just around the corner — the clocks will go back an hour, making it dark even earlier in the morning and dark again by five or so in the afternoon — and statistics show the days around the time change can be particularly dangerous.  You can purchase a reflective vest for as low as $13, which is peanuts. But regardless of the cost, reflective clothing could save your life.  Isn’t your life worth it?

"When Peter Hadjis opened the Palace Restaurant on Pape Ave., just north of Danforth Ave. in 1983, there weren’t many Greek restaurants on The Danforth strip. “Next to us were mostly fruit markets and clothing businesses. It was mixed, Italians and Greeks, some Chinese. That’s it,” said Hadjis. Now, 35 years later, the Danforth is known as Greektown and is home to the city’s biggest annual food festival — Taste of the Danforth — which celebrates its 25th year this weekend from Friday evening until Sunday night at 10 p.m. And Hadjis, now 78, has become a neighbourhood fixture. He’s chatty, warm and always eager to talk about food. Passersby stop to say hello. Guests at his restaurant brag online about lucking out when he tends to their table. But in spite of marking a milestone, this year’s celebration is bittersweet as it comes three weeks after a  , killing two people, 10-year-old   and 18-year-old  , and injuring 13 others. It is also the 100th anniversary of the 1918 anti-Greek riots that targeted the Greek community in Toronto’s downtown core. The riots — that were marked in a ceremony and photo display at City Hall last week — are not well known to many Torontonians. But they inadvertently shaped the city’s future, leading to the east end creation of Greektown and the food festival that organizers say draws more than a million visitors in recent years, generating millions of dollars for the local economy and charities across the GTA. The riots began in early August 1918, a few months before the First World War officially ended, when a drunk and belligerent veteran was kicked out of the Greek-owned White City Cafe on Yonge St. near Carlton St. It just so happened that a convention for war veterans was taking place in the city and word got out that one of their own had been disrespected. Soon thousands of people (accounts vary from 5,000 to 20,000) descended on that intersection and for three days looted and destroyed the Greek businesses in the area.  Tensions were already high between the Greek community and those patriotic to Canada’s war effort. Greece had remained neutral during the first years of the war and its government didn’t allow Greek nationals abroad to fight in the war if they did not have citizenship in their new countries. However, people believed they were unpatriotic, which led to feelings of resentment toward the small community of a few thousand Greek immigrants. Still, the damage was done and the Greeks abandoned what is now the city’s downtown core. The 1960s and ’70s saw the largest influx of Greek immigrants to Toronto, spurred on by political and economic instability in Greece. A 1976 article in the Star estimates about 30,000 mostly first-generation Greeks settled on the Danforth. There didn’t seem to be a particular reason why the Danforth was chosen, but a 1984 Star article on Little Athens (as it was dubbed back then) quotes a Greek business owner: “Who can say why we located here? One guy opens a shop and it starts. Like other ethnic groups we were short on the language. So we located where we could find affordable housing, buy necessities and speak our language. Now we know English, so there’s a great deal of movement all over.” In 1994, a year after the local Business Improvement Area officially gave the neighbourhood its Greektown moniker, 23 restaurants along the Danforth got together—mainly Greek and Italian—to offer sample-sized bites to passersby to promote their businesses during the slow summer months, creating the first Taste of the Danforth. About 5,000 visitors came to the small festival, organizers say. “For a few years, it was nothing special,” says Hadjis, who remembers serving dolma, moussaka and roasted lamb at the first event. “It was very few businesses from Chester to Pape (Aves.) and it was about getting people to know the area and try the food they wouldn’t know how to order.”  The idea caught on and Taste of the Danforth become one of Toronto’s first food festivals, predating Taste of Little Italy and Ribfest, which both started in 1999. By 1996, the festival got so big that the streets had to be closed for the first time.  Now Taste of the Danforth stretches two kilometres along the strip from Broadview to Donlands Aves. The food also goes beyond Greek and Italian bites, reflecting the changing demographics of the neighbourhood with plates that include Chinese sesame balls filled with read bean paste, Turkish pizzas, Japanese gyozas, Jamaican-inspired jerk chicken pierogies, Indian butter chicken, Filipino halo-halo and Mexican tacos and street corn. “Whatever you’ll try, it’s good. That’s the important thing,” says Hadjis. “People like it and are coming back, telling their friends and family. People aren’t disappointed.” He predicts this year’s festival will be the best, adding that people have already made a point of dining specifically on the Danforth in the last weeks to show unity with the neighbourhood in the wake of the gun attack. The festival’s opening ceremonies on Friday will include a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting as well as acknowledgement of the first responders and civilians who attended to the injured. “What happened was a tragedy, so I think people are going to think positive,” said Hadjis. “People are going to come out and support that we’re in a good city. We’re going to be OK. When people come here, they have to know that we have to come together like a family.” ",0,Taste of the Danforth has united Toronto for 25 years
"Patrick Savoy was at a recent open-air concert. He took a moment to note the exits. On April 23, a white van barrelled down the Yonge St. sidewalk. Savoy performed first aid on a dying woman. He is a witness to the worst mass killing in Toronto history, and he says he will never forget the carnage he saw that day. But he didn’t let that memory hold him back, or stop him from enjoying the music. “You have to keep living your life as is,” Savoy said. That’s his message to the people who were going about their daily lives when  , killing 10-year-old Julianna Kozis of Markham and 18-year-old Reese Fallon and injuring 13 others. “Be aware of what’s going on, be aware of your surroundings, but still live your life,” he told the Star on Wednesday. “It’s an anomaly and we live in Toronto and people are there to support you.” The survivors, witnesses and shaken local business owners who were touched by the Yonge St. van attack have moved past the candlelit vigils and memorials overflowing with flowers. Three months later, they’re healing and reflecting on what they’ve learned — and how that could now help the Danforth community. Savoy came to the aid of Dorothy Sewell that day,  . After she was struck, Savoy took her pulse, checked to see if she was conscious and performed CPR.  She was one of the 10 killed. Savoy said he got in touch with her family and went to her funeral. “I went through the process of shock and grief, and then the funeral was closure,” he said. Savoy said it is “tough” to remember what he saw after the rampage. “Those visuals will never, ever, ever leave your mind,” he said. “You have to accept that those are images that you saw, you’re going to remember them and it’s going to affect you some days, and some days it won’t.”  Michael Smith’s mother,  .  After the Danforth shooting, “it honestly all just came crashing back,” he said  “It stays with me every single day. I still think about it. The biggest thing that’s come out of this is how close I am with my family, how much support the community has given us.”  In the immediate aftermath on the violence on the Danforth, Smith said the focus should be purely on recovery. “I blocked out everything, and it was my mum and that was it,” he said. “In hindsight, that’s all it should ever be, is just focus on your family and focus on the people you care about.  At Willowdale Baptist Church, near Yonge and Finch Ave., that’s something senior pastor Bruce Jones said the community is already doing. In the days after the van attack, the church opened its doors to offer “coffee, rest place, rest rooms, prayer, water,” with a small handwritten sign to mourners at Olive Square.  The event brought the community closer, Jones said, with people being more willing to catch each other’s eyes and smile. “The best advice I think I could give any community that is grieving is look up and have your eyes open,” he said. They’ve had to look out for each other a little more, as tragedies can “trigger other pains,” for people.  “We don’t want to forget these kinds of tragedies but we also don’t want to wallow in the emotions of them,” he said. Willowdale has also struggled, he said, with how to permanently memorialize the space at Olive Square, a question residents and businesses owners at the Danforth will also have to consider. On Wednesday afternoon at Olive Square, where a mountain of flowers and stuffed animals once marked the spot across from where the attack began, only a few messages of support scrawled in black marker on stone remain. “#Toronto Strong,” “God Bless,” and a peeling faded sticker next to a small white “Love Square sign.” “We don’t want to forget these kinds of tragedies but we also don’t want to wallow in the emotions of them,” Jones said. Many of the flowers at Olive Square and the nearby Mel Lastman Square came from Secret Garden Floral & Gift Boutique. Owners Summer Lin and Katherine Liu put out free bouquets on the curb after the van attack. Lin, who spoke to the Star through a colleague who translated from Mandarin, said that offering the flowers was a way for them to feel like they were doing something, and helped ease the sad days following the attack. She said Willowdale came together as a community, and she urged the people of the Danforth to do the same.  Her message to them?  “It will pass,” she said. “I know it’s sad but it will go away. But we will never forget people who were injured and died.” Victim Services Toronto provides a 24/7 hotline providing support and information for victims. It can be reached at 416-808-7066.

"Tanya Wilson was locking up her tattoo shop on the Danforth, heading out for dinner with a friend. It was just before 10 p.m. She heard shots. “I thought it was firecrackers.” She pauses. “No, that’s not true. I thought it was shots.” Because we think that way now in Toronto, at the sound of sharp cracks. Not firecrackers, not a car backfiring. Bullets. Wilson glimpsed a white man with longish hair, the shooter, and hastily pulled back inside. “Honestly, it was all happening so fast, I didn’t know what to do.” Suddenly, two people outside were banging on the front door, pleading to be let in. In her panic, Wilson at first feared these individuals might have been allied with the gunman in some way, trying to force themselves into her business, Skin Deep. Then she saw the blood. Both the older woman and a younger man had been struck. “They were freaking out, crying, ‘There’s a man with a gun!’” Wilson hustled them indoors. Put each in one of her tattoo chairs and set about applying first aid, first fashioning a tourniquet above the bullet holes. Both — a mother and her adult son, she’d learn — had been hit in the leg, below the knee. “I know how to handle blood,” Wilson told the Star. “I put on my medical gloves. Mostly it’s just using common sense.” She turned off the lights, hoping the shooter would believe the premises were vacant and ushered the victims into the basement. Then all of them huddled for the half-hour until Wilson was able to flag an officer and paramedics were summoned. Four hours later, with the victims removed by ambulance, Wilson and her friend were still being held in place, waiting to be interviewed by police. A block away, her tattoo teacher, Trevor Boucher had pulled up in vehicle, trying to talk his way past a police cordon on Logan. But only cops and first responders were being allowed through. Even those who live on the Danforth, trying to make their way home on a Sunday night, were turned away, advised to find somewhere else to sleep on this maddened night. Boucher worked the phones in three-way conversations, attempting to calm Wilson. “I’m covered in blood!” “Let me get my girl,” Boucher implored officers, to no avail. “Or let her come to me. She’s terrified.” To the Star, he said: “She’s a hero. She saved people tonight.” “It’s just so weird,” said Wilson, when the Star reached her. “I mean, we’re all aware of the shootings that have been happening around the city. But this is the Danforth, you know? It’s a beautiful neighbourhood with always lots of people on the street, walking around, going to restaurants, sitting on patios. “How did it get so crazy?” Wilson’s thoughts were with the little girl rushed to emergency in critical condition. That 10-year-old child, as police Chief Mark Saunders disclosed at a Monday morning press conference, did not survive. “Just a little girl,” said Wilson sadly. “That’s where my head is right now.” Also killed was an 18-year-old female, identified as Reese Fallon, who hailed from the Beaches area. And the shooter. Police sources told the Star that 29-year-old Faisal Hussain died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, although the Special Investigations Unit would not confirm that detail.  After an exchange of gunfire with officers, he fled and his body was discovered on Danforth, the SIU reported. An autopsy was to be conducted Tuesday morning and ballistics conducted on the bullet.  How he died is a critical part of the investigation undertaken by the SIU, which is called in whenever a civilian is killed or seriously injured in an incident involving police. But the larger investigation, involving a crime scene that extends for several blocks, is the responsibility of Toronto police, led by veteran homicide Det. Sgt. Terry Browne. At Second Cup, on the corner of Danforth and Hampton Aves., the owner pointed out three bullet holes that had punctured the front window. The small sidewalk patio had been full of patrons, enjoying the mild evening. “I was in the back so I didn’t see what happened,” said one employee. “But suddenly all these people were running through here.” Directly in front of the Second Cup, police had placed upturned coffee cups, marking the spots where shell casings had been found — a dozen of them in that chunk of sidewalk alone. Nobody inside had been injured. Jessica Young, an employee, told the Star’s Wendy Gillis that she’d seen the shooter. “He was probably no taller than me, wearing a black baseball cap, dark clothes ... That’s all I could make out,” Young said, adding that the man appeared to have a pistol or handgun. “I was shaken, terrified. It’s not every day you almost get shot.” Another man: “I heard at least 20 shots, in intervals. Reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping spent.” Other witnesses said the man had his shirt sleeves rolled up, had walked back and forth across Danforth, shooting indiscriminately, assuming a shooter’s stance, as if he knew how to handle a firearm. It appears to have been a semi-automatic, with a magazine, given the volley of shots — multiple bang-bang-bang — with pauses in between. “He was skinny but he had this horrible look on his face,” another witness told reporters, “like he was under the influence or something.” The shooter was only some 10 feet away. “I fell down. He ran across, kept shooting and ran down the street.” Thirteen victims wounded, some with “life-changing” injuries, said Browne. Men, women and children running, ducking, taking cover behind a fountain before bystanders and employees of local business ventured out with towels and rags to staunch bleeding. On a night of unimaginable horror, there were heroes too. In the small hours of Monday morning and into the day, video captured on cellphones began surfacing on social media. The shooter is seen firing into storefronts and cafés, walking purposefully westward through Greektown. A man on a mission, it appears. Police said warrants had been sought to search the shooter’s home. If investigators retrieve computer files, those and any social media footprint will be invaluable in uncovering a motive. Why did he concentrate his fire on some establishments while bypassing others? Why did he tell one man, “I’m not going to shoot you” and stride on by? “I can’t speak to what was on this individual’s mind,” said Browne. “We’ll certainly dissect everything. We’re going into the background of this individual.” Before the sun rose on an eerily depopulated Danforth, usually so vibrant a neighbourhood, dozens of officers and crime scene reconstruction experts worked the area, filming and measuring. The bomb squad also conducted a controlled detonation of a package, which may have been the bag the shooter was carrying, slung over a shoulder. “We’re going to blow up a package now,” an officer warned onlookers milling around the Danforth-Broadview intersection. The thump of that detonation could be heard for blocks around 1 a.m. Saunders and Mayor John Tory tried to reassure the public. They’ve done a lot of that over recent weeks and months as blood has been spilled on the streets, in a playground, on the Entertainment District sidewalk, in Yorkville, in Kensington market, at a church fair. But this mass shooting has more a feel of random terror and malice, bringing to mind the   in North York in April — 10 dead, 16 with non-fatal injuries, some of them grievous. What in God’s name is happening? Murders, van attack, a lone gunman rampage, in a city that has always boasted of its safeness. Rightly or wrongly, it feels profoundly less safe now, the violence as brazen and senseless one-on-one as one-on-dozens. Madness descending.

"Police were saying little about the motive behind the multiple murder in Fredericton on Friday, in which a man allegedly fired a long gun from the window of his third-floor apartment, killing four people in a parking lot below. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, is charged with the first-degree murders of Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, Donnie Robichaud, 42, and two Fredericton police officers, Sara Burns, 43, and Robb Costello, 45.  Officials said Raymond was hospitalized and was being treated for serious injuries after being shot by police. He is to remain in custody until he appears in court Aug. 27, police said. Martin Gaudet, deputy police chief in Fredericton, said investigators had yet to find a link between the victims and the accused that would explain a motive for the shooting.  “That link has not been established yet. And that is a piece of information that we’re looking to establish,” Gaudet said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.  However, friends and relatives of the victims said Wright and Robichaud had just begun a relationship. Raymond and Robichaud were both residents of the apartment complex on Brookside Dr., although they lived in separate buildings, according to Judith Aguilar, an office manager for the complex’s owners.  Aguilar said Raymond had been living in the complex for about four months and was an avid cyclist. He often wore his bike helmet into the office when he went in to pay his rent in cash, she said. “He seemed normal and made small talk every time you saw him. He came in every month to pay rent. He was always polite and pleasant,” Aguilar said Saturday.  In an interview with The Canadian Press, Aguilar said that at one point maintenance workers needed to do some repairs in Raymond’s apartment and he didn’t want them there while he wasn’t present. “He seemed concerned,” she said. “He said he had an expensive computer and an expensive bike and he didn’t want anyone to be there alone. They didn’t even have to go all the way into the apartment; they were just fixing his door frame at the time.” She said she didn’t interact with Robichaud much because he didn’t come into the office to make his rent payments, and she did not know if he knew Raymond. On Saturday morning, the area surrounding the crime scene was cordoned off by yellow tape, but police allowed some shaken residents through to check on their pets. The area remained closed Saturday night, with a mobile police command post on scene. More than half a dozen bullet holes could be seen in the window of an upper-floor corner apartment, while a second window appeared to have been mostly smashed. Joe Cartwright, a resident in the building, said all the doors in the complex had been kicked in and one of his cats had escaped. Cartwright said his girlfriend, Caitlyn Francis, and 4-year-old son had been at home during the shooting, and he had rushed to the scene in a panic once he realized his family could be in danger. “I’m very torn up,” he said. “I’m not doing very well at all. My girlfriend’s not, my son’s not, so we’re going to go and just try to calm down from this.” Francis said she had been getting her stepson ready for daycare at 7:10 a.m. when she heard police sirens. She looked out and saw a police car pull in. “Not even a minute or two later, I heard the first gunshot,” she said.  The next moments were a blur as she focused on keeping her stepson safe and calm as several more shots could be heard, she said. “I pulled him into my bedroom, got him to lay on the floor back there, tried to play cartoons for him, but he still could hear (the gunshots),” she said. “There was no playing off what those sounds were. He knew it.” Robichaud’s cousin, Sean Callahan, said Robichaud had been living in the apartment complex for about three or four months.  “The apartment was his, and his sons would go back and forth between the mother’s house and his house. He was living alone. It was Donnie living by himself,” Callahan said Saturday.  Callahan said he and his cousin were very close, talking on the phone most days. But he hadn’t yet met Robichaud’s new girlfriend.  “I talked to him Thursday … I called him up because I needed a part for my truck, so we were talking about my truck, and then we were talking about him, how happy he is with his girlfriend, that his life’s on track. He was just so happy with everything,” said Callahan.  “There’s nothing bad you can say about the guy. When I got a message yesterday asking me if Donnie got shot, I was like, who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?”  At Saturday’s news conference, Fredericton police Chief Leanne Fitch asked people to be patient with the investigation.  “This is a complex investigation, and it must be thorough in nature. I ask residents not to speculate, … Please let all of our investigators do their work and find the facts that need to be found,” she said.  The apartment complex where the four victims were shot is in a suburban part of Fredericton, north of the Saint John River.  The New Brunswick capital has a population of fewer than 60,000; its police force is small and tight-knit.  Fitch said police from around the region started arriving Saturday to give local officers some time off to grieve the loss of Costello and Burns.  Burns was married and a mother of three. She was a Fredericton police officer for two years, and had served for two years before that in the auxiliary force. “Sara absolutely loved her job, and went to work each shift committed to serving this great community,” her family said in a statement, released through Fredericton police on Saturday.  Costello, a 20-year veteran of the force, had a common-law spouse and four children.  “Robb was the single most positive person I have ever met, and that was obvious to everyone who met him,” said his partner, Jackie Steeves, in a statement through police. “He had a special way of dealing with people — fair, but strong and tough when needed. He was the only officer I’ve ever known to write a ticket and have the recipient thank him for it.”  “While I met Robb relatively late in my life, he was my soulmate, my best friend and the light of my life,” she added.  Flowers, stuffed animals and cards started appearing outside the Fredericton police headquarters Friday, and the tributes continued to grow on Saturday.  A day after the shooting incident Fredericton police responded in force to another event Saturday night. Heavily armed officers and about a dozen police vehicles encircled part of a neighbourhood on the city's north side. Police officials would only describe it as an active event, but stated it was not related to the shooting incident Friday. Police brought in their armoured response vehicle and kept people away in a one block area. However, after about four hours they gave the all clear and left the scene. The city has been on edge since the shootings Friday, and even the common-law partner of fallen officer Const. Robb Costello responded to the reports of the Saturday incident. Jackie McLean tweeted: ""What a thing to read while you work on writing your spouse's obituary."" ",0,"Fredericton shooter fired long gun from elevated position, police say"
"Ontario’s Minister of Labour has dismissed a directive instructing staff not to initiate any new proactive inspections into  and other violations as a “low-level internal memo,” after the Star revealed that understaffing has resulted in a  . The memo, obtained by the Star, said a civil service hiring freeze had contributed to a significant backlog in employment standards complaints, and meant that inspectors should “not initiate any new inspections” in order to triage mounting wait times.  The memo is signed by the ministry’s Director of Employment Standards, who is appointed by the Minister of Labour to administer the Employment Standards Act. That legislation sets the basic floor of rights for all Ontario workers. “I don’t know of its accuracy … we’re looking to see if that is accurate,” Labour Minister Laurie Scott told reporters after New Democrat MPP Jamie West (Sudbury) raised concerns about the memo in the Legislature’s daily question period. Scott blamed a backlog of cases from the previous Liberal government, which left office June 29. The Star has reported extensively on  at the ministry. Last year, the government recovered only one-third of the wages owed to individual workers after they filed employment standards claims, compared to an almost 100 per cent recovery rate through proactive inspections. The Liberal government subsequently committed to hiring 175 new staff to double its complement of employment standards inspectors and conduct more proactive inspections. The stated goal was to inspect one in 10 Ontario workplaces. Only around half of the new inspectors were hired before the Progressive Conservative government took power and instituted a hiring freeze. Asked if she would order the memo’s direction reversed, Scott replied “let’s see what the real story is.” West said the Conservatives can’t blame their Liberal predecessors any longer. “This wasn’t a memo that came from the previous government. This is a memo that came from their government,” he told the Star. “At some point you’re the government and you have to fix it.” West, who is the NDP’s labour critic, accused the Conservatives of planning to let Employment Standards Act inspections slide as the government fulfils a promise to cut $6 billion in spending, letting “bad bosses” off the hook. “They know people don’t file complaints unless they’re quitting or being fired from a job because they’re afraid of losing their job,” West added. “They’re not investigating, so people know they’re going to get away with it.” Avvy Go, director of Metro Toronto Chinese & Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, said she raised concerns about enforcement with the ministry after the June election. “Based on our 30 years of working with low-income vulnerable workers who are in non-union settings, we came to the conclusion that the current system based on complaints-driven compliance doesn’t work,” she said.  “By the time workers file their claims, most of the time they have already lost their jobs. Sometimes the companies have even gone under. Many of these cases, even if they are successful at the (ministry), they are not able to collect the wages,” she added. “That’s why it’s very important to have proactive enforcement of the Employment Standards Act.” As previously reported by the Star, Go represented a group of around 60 workers owed more than $675,000 in unpaid wages by the Regal Restaurant chain in Toronto.  It’s a case she calls a “perfect example” of the need for proactive inspections to catch problems early: in 2014,  filed employment standards claims at the ministry. In 2015, the Ministry of Labour ordered the company to pay. Three years later, Go says workers have only received about 15 per cent of their money from their now-shuttered employer. “These are low-income clients. Their income is very low to begin with so to not receive their full pay will have a tremendous impact on them and their family,” she said. “Some of them may, as a result of not getting paid, they may be evicted by their landlords, or they will not be able to buy nutritious food for their children.” “If the ministry were to proactively inspect restaurants or factories these workers would not have to wait,” she added. “And (the company) would never have owed that amount to begin with.” In the past, proactive employment standards inspections — which usually focus on high-risk sectors like   or the food industry — have routinely found 75 per cent of employers in violation of laws around minimum wage, overtime, public holiday pay, and other workplace rights. News of the inspections pause comes the same week as the Progressive Conservative government   that will significantly roll back recently enacted “job-killing” labour protections. “Ontario should be open for business,” Go said. “But the businesses we are open to must obey the law.” ",0,Labour minister blames backlog of workplace complaints on Liberal predecessors
"Ontario is throwing Michigan moose to the wolves. Premier Doug Ford announced Thursday that four to six wolves will be exported to neighbouring Michigan to cope with the exploding moose population on the state’s  . “Ontario and Michigan have a long history of friendship, an abundance of natural beauty and a proud tradition of working together to conserve our natural ecosystems,” Ford said during a northern Ontario tour. “We all have an important role to play in protecting the environment and we’re happy to do our part to help Michigan’s wildlife thrive,” he said. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said “this project will help the National Park Service restore ecological balance to the island park and preserve this wild and special place for generations to come.” “Michigan is proud to be part of this international effort to return a viable wolf population to Isle Royale,  Until last month, there were only two wolves left on the remote Lake Superior island park that is home to 1,475 moose. Four wolves were recently brought from Minnesota — one male and three females — so the addition of up to six from Ontario will help boost the pack. Wolves are Isle Royale’s top predator and are critical to the island’s ecosystem. Officials hope to have 20 to 30 wolves within three years. “In addition to individual wolves from Minnesota and Michigan, bringing Ontario wolves to the park provides the best mix of genetic sources for the reintroduced wolf population,” said Phyllis Green, the Isle Royale park superintendent  “This collaborative effort will help ensure the start of a robust population of wolves on Isle Royale.” Scientists have been doing annual studies of the wolf and moose population in the park for 60 years — in 2009, there were 500 moose there. The wolf population peaked at 50 in 1980. ",0,Howls of delight as Ontario sends wolves to Michigan to help with moose over-population
" is urging Ontario businesses to rally behind him as he stares down the “forces” opposed to his rollback of workplace protections and his cancellation of a higher minimum wage. Speaking to the Ontario Economic Summit in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Friday, Ford warned that powerful interests are trying to thwart his changes. “Not everybody out there supports making Ontario open for business,” the premier told the corporate audience at the event organized by the Progressive Conservative-friendly Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC). “There are forces in Ontario who had it good under the stagnant Liberal economy, who were happy seeing businesses close and freezing workers out of better jobs,” he said.  Ontario’s economy has actually been growing for years before he toppled the Liberals in the June election and Statistics Canada reports the unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, among the nation’s lowest in a generation. Still, Ford said scrapping the $1 hike to the $14-an-hour minimum wage — and eliminating two paid sick days for Ontario workers as of Jan. 1 — to boost business has awakened his political foes. “These forces are already organizing and preparing to spend a lot of money to try to stop us,” the premier said, apparently referring to labour organizations he did not name. “Some of them have already engaged in violence, crime and intimidation. This week they broke into and vandalized (Labour) Minister Laurie Scott’s constituency office,” he said. Unknown vandals   the front plate glass window and door and spray-painted graffiti reading “Attack workers we fight back $15” on an exterior wall of Scott’s Lindsay office on Tuesday night. “But these desperate intimidation tactics won’t stop us,” stressed Ford. “We’re prepared for the fight ahead and today ... my ask of the OCC, of big and small businesses, of entrepreneurs, of skilled trades people, of colleges, of pro-job labour unions, of young people trying to get into skilled trades, is to keep it up,” the premier said. “Keep fighting with me. You know that I’m here to fight for the little guy. I’m here to fight for that job that was previously out of reach,” he said in a partisan, campaign-style speech. “Because, unlike the Liberals and the NDP, we believe that when business succeeds, workers succeed, families succeed (and) communities succeed.” Under former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals, the minimum wage, which jumped from $11.60 an hour to $14 last Jan. 1, was to further increase to $15 next year.  To help small businesses — whose income tax rate was cut this year from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by the Liberals to compensate for the wage hike — it will be frozen at $14 for two years. After October 2020, it will be tied to the inflation rate, meaning an annual increase of about 25 cents an hour so it will likely reach $15 in 2023. Ford, who received a standing ovation from the crowd, also used his address as a forum to attack the prime minister, who has emerged as a favourite punching bag with a federal election next year. “This week, Justin Trudeau unveiled the latest change to his carbon tax plan. He is promising to send everybody a cheque to cover their carbon tax costs. Just in time for the federal election,” he said.  “We all know what happens next — once the election is over — the rebate disappears. And families and businesses across Ontario will be stuck paying the carbon tax forever.” The provincial government “will use every tool we have to fight this terrible tax,” he said, referring to the $35 million he has earmarked for a constitutional court challenge of the measure. Also Friday, the premier said there would soon be signs at provincial border crossings declaring “Ontario is open for business.” However instead of the “big neon signs” he touted during the election campaign, they will be standard blue highway markers erected by the Ministry of Transportation. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said “the election is over — there is no need for these goofy road signs.” “It’s time to govern,” said Schreiner, noting “cancelling the ($15) minimum wage and eliminating paid sick days will make life less affordable for people.” ",0,Premier Doug Ford urges businesses to rally behind him in fight against $15 minimum wage

"MONTREAL—Is a carbon tax a hill Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is willing to die on? That question had been in the back of many political minds since Ontario – under its new PC government — bailed out of the federal   framework last spring.  That resulted in a shift in the provincial balance from mostly behind Trudeau’s carbon-pricing scheme to increasingly against it. As of Tuesday’s rollout of individual tax rebates to attend the introduction on Jan. 1 of a federal  in the four provinces — including Ontario — that are declining to meet federally set emissions targets with measures of their own, the answer is in. There will not be a pre-election  from the   framework negotiated with the provinces in the sunnier federal-provincial environment of Trudeau’s early days in power. Instead, for the second time in a decade, a federal Liberal leader is about to stake the electoral fate of his party on putting a price on carbon pollution. And in this case, action will already have followed words as the carbon tax will have been in effect for months by the time the federal campaign gets officially underway. But some water has flowed under the bridge since Stéphane Dion’s ill-fated attempt to sell Canadians on his Green Shift in the 2008 campaign.  For one, the Liberals are about to campaign from the stronger position of incumbent party, with all the tools of government at their disposal. The rebates paid out to those affected by the federal levy will go some way to blunt Conservative allegations that the bid to put a price on carbon pollution is little more than a tax grab. Perhaps more importantly, two of the more populous provinces — Quebec and British Columbia — have just spent the past decade experimenting with carbon-pricing models. Notwithstanding the doomsday scenarios painted by opponents of Trudeau’s carbon tax, neither provincial government feels it has been the worse for it. In both cases, the policy of putting a price on carbon pollution has survived changes in government — from right to left in B.C.’s case and left to right in Quebec’s more recent one. If next fall’s federal campaign is lining up to be déjà vu all over again, it is not as much because it could parallel Dion’s disastrous campaign as because many of its features are reminiscent of the 1988 free trade election. Then as now, the provinces were divided. Those divisions existed not only at the national level but also within regions.  Alberta was staunchly behind Brian Mulroney’s free trade deal while B.C. was home to a vocal anti-FTA coalition. New Brunswick premier Frank McKenna liked the deal; P.E.I.’s Joe Ghiz did not. Like Trudeau on carbon pricing today, Mulroney had solid support for his free trade project in his home province. Quebec’s political class was overwhelmingly on side with the Canada/U.S. trade agreement.  The story was completely different in Ontario. He would not like the comparison but former Liberal premier David Peterson was the Doug Ford of the free-trade federal election.  Like Ford vis-à-vis Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, Peterson cut a larger figure as premier of Canada’s most populous province than John Turner as federal leader of the official opposition And like Scheer, Turner could ill afford to be offside with his Ontario ally. In 1988, corporate Canada backed free trade to the hilt. On Thursday, Canada’s Business Council similarly came out in support of Trudeau’s carbon-pricing policy. But as opposed to the free trade battle that found big business and organized labour in opposite camps, the climate change debate finds many corporate and union leaders on the same pro-carbon tax side. When stacked against the real-life experiences of Quebec and B.C. the Conservative math on the devastating economic impact of Trudeau’s carbon tax does not readily add up. Scheer and his brain trust obviously believe their electoral calculations will. This week, both sides in the debate have drawn deep and defining lines in the pro-election sand. Voters will have the last word next fall. Over the decades that followed Mulroney’s 1988 victory, most of those who had fought in the anti-FTA election trenches eventually laid down their arms and joined the pro-free trade camp. That was never more in evidence than over the recent NAFTA renegotiation.  If next fall’s federal election does turn into a plebiscite on whether or not to try to mitigate climate change by taxing carbon pollution, its outcome could finally put the debate to rest.

"A London man has been charged with manslaughter after a hit-and-run collision killed a 48-year-old man in Etobicoke Monday night. Around 11 p.m., a 40-year-old man allegedly became involved in an altercation with the older man at the intersection of Ninth St. and Garnett Janes Rd., near Lake Shore Blvd. W. and Islington Ave. The older man received life-threatening injuries, and later died in hospital. The younger man then fled in a Dodge, according to police.  Police have charged Constantinos Hondrocostas with manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death, failure to stop at scene of accident causing death, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, and impairment by drug. He appeared in court Tuesday.  The incident was initially reported as the sound of gunshots, according to police. “We were told that a couple of gunshots were heard and that a car was speeding away,” said Const. David Hopkinson. “There was a person lying in the middle of the street. (The caller wasn’t) sure if the person had been struck by the car or if it was gunfire.” When officers arrived, they didn’t find any gunshot wounds on the male victim and believed the severity and nature of his injuries were likely consistent with a collision with a vehicle. Bystanders attempted CPR before emergency services got there, but the man died of his injuries after an emergency run to hospital. Hopkinson said that a “grey, four door car was seen fleeing the scene,” and five hours after the collision, a car matching that description was found in the area of Lake Shore Blvd. and Sixth St., just around the corner from the original scene of the collision.  Police continue to investigate, and are asking any witnesses or people with dash-camera or security footage of the incident to come forward.  By the Star’s count, 22 pedestrians and four cyclists have been killed in Toronto this year, with nearly 100 total deaths since the initiative was announced. The Star’s numbers are higher than police statistics in part because the force doesn’t count collisions on provincial highways within Toronto, or cyclist deaths that don’t involve a motorist.

"Ontario’s health minister says the province’s opioid task force hasn’t been disbanded, but at the same time, it has no meetings scheduled. Following days of questions from iPolitics, Health Minister Christine Elliott said Thursday the Progressive Conservatives haven’t done away with the panel created by the former Liberal government. “There are no plans whatsoever to disband them,” Elliott said in response to questions from the NDP. Several members of the 41-person panel told iPolitics this week that the government hasn’t told them whether the task force would be kept or cancelled. Prior to the election, the panel met monthly to advise the government on its response to the overdose crisis and to share information from the front lines. Since the Progressive Conservatives took office, though, it has only met once over the phone. The task force is made up of emergency responders, front-line workers and people with lived experiences of addiction, and was charged with advising the government on its policies and flagging emerging issues. “They have performed a valuable service,” Elliott said about the group. But she couldn’t say what their role would be in future, nor when they would next meet. “There will be further work coming forward,” she said, but noted that her government’s first priority is to help overdose-prevention and drug-consumption sites transition to the new model her government is rolling out. The opposition is accusing the government of keeping the task force in name only. NDP MPP Bhutila Karpoche said Elliott evaded her questions in the legislature and “did not say specifically what the future of the opioid task force was going to be.” “Is it going to continue to do the work? Is it going to meet monthly to advise the minister’s office and the government on the ever-changing and growing opioid crisis? We don’t know that,” Karpoche said. She said that’s particularly concerning, because the number of people dying of overdoses and ending up in emergency rooms keeps going up. Despite Elliott’s insistence that the task force hasn’t been disbanded, none of the members who spoke with iPolitics has been contacted about a meeting schedule or future work. “There’s been no emails, no texts, no calls since the election pertaining to the task force,” panel member Dr. Jeff Turnbull said Thursday. Turnbull is a prominent Ottawa doctor and the medical director of Ottawa Inner City Health. He stressed the need for the government to meet regularly with the task force, because the ever-changing nature of the crisis requires changes to government policy. For example, he said in the last two months, he’s started seeing fentanyl strains that are resistant to naloxone. For such overdoses, he might need three or four doses of naloxone, compared to the two provided in free kits and recommended by government policy. “Only we as providers see and are experiencing that,” he said, adding it’s information the government is likely missing without the task force, because the latter served as an early-warning system and sounding board. “To be flexible, to be nimble, to adjust quickly, it is important for people making policy to hear from people on the front lines,” Turnbull said. That said, he gave Elliott credit for keeping the drug-consumption sites open. “I’m glad that the minister of health has listened to the community (about) the safe-injection sites,” Turnbull said. “She’s clearly framed this as part of an integrated strategy for drug use and rehabilitation, and I think it would be very good for this committee to participate in (future) discussions.” He said he hopes the government plans meetings with the task force “as soon as possible.” ",0,"Ontario says opioid task force still active, but doesn’t plan to meet"

Paramedics responded to the call just before midnight to the area of Hwy. 404 and Elgin Mills Rd. The man was travelling south in the northbound lanes towards oncoming traffic when he smashed into another vehicle head on, Schmidt said. He said the collision took place just north of Elgin Mills Rd. at 19th Ave. The 64-year-old succumbed to his injuries, Schmidt said Tuesday morning.

"Less than three months after losing his beloved 27-year-old son to cancer, athletic retiree Brad Stevenson, 61, lost everything else to a careless driver. Motorist Isiah Martin’s penalty for darting a GMC across six lanes of Scarborough traffic into the path of a TTC bus, and then pinwheeling into pedestrians Stevenson and Grant Underhill, 64 — killing Stevenson and gravely injuring his old friend — was a $1,000 fine and three-month driving ban.  Two other charges were dropped in return for his guilty plea to careless driving. “Through your error in judgment you have shaken the lives of our entire family. We will never get to see Bradley grow old,” Stevenson’s brother Michael said in a victim impact statement read aloud by a prosecutor at the recent sentencing for Martin, who chose not to attend Old City Hall court but sent his own apologetic statement. The mistake stole an elderly mother’s sole caregiver and the Stevenson family’s joy in hugging him and watching him put on skates and swing a golf club, his brother said. “These things we believe have been robbed from us because of the fateful decision you made on July 29, 2016,” the statement concluded. “May Bradley Gerald Stevenson rest in peace. There is no fine or penalty that will bring Bradley back.” With pedestrians and cyclists dying on Toronto streets at an alarming rate — at least 45 in 2016 — safety advocates are   to lax penalties in hopes of saving lives and reflecting the toll drivers can take. The advocates, including  , are calling on the Ontario government to toughen fines for drivers who kill or seriously injure “vulnerable road users,” to include community service as punishment rather than just fines and to force such drivers to attend their sentencings. Ontario Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca recently told the Star he is awaiting advice from ministry staff on potential changes to reduce the death toll. He could offer no timetable. In an interview John Thompson described his longtime friend Brad, a freshly retired City of Toronto worker teased for his resemblance to ex-NFL coach Mike Ditka, as generous, big-hearted and naturally sporty. The crash, Thompson said, was “a terrible, terrible tragedy to a family that was already suffering. “Brad was all about friends and family — his son Ryan was his reason for living.” Ryan Stevenson died May 11, 2016. A   published two months earlier quoted him as saying he was determined to beat cancer so he could become a Toronto police officer like his late grandfather former Det.-Sgt. Gerry Stevenson, who helped solve the notorious 1977 murder of 12-year-old shoeshine boy Emanuel Jacques. Ryan's family, including mom Cathy, had set up a fund to help pay for innovative medical treatments. Underhill said in his victim impact statement, also read aloud by prosecutor Jamie MacPherson, that he couldn’t attend court because he was home recovering from chemotherapy for colon cancer diagnosed after the July crash. Injuries including broken wrists, a fractured knee and three breaks to a leg, requiring implantation of a metal plate and screws, ended his “physically independent and mentally sound life” and left him reliant on his wife and others. “Mentally it is challenging to maintain a sense of hope and optimism that the independence and ease of life I had worked for and enjoyed will ever be regained,” he said. “In addition I am still trying to come to terms with the loss of a longtime friend and to understand how it is that I survived this accident and he did not.” Court heard Martin, driving home at 6:25 p.m., simply misjudged the intersection of Kingston and Saunders Rds. Det.-Const. Lester Lalla, who investigated the crash, said in an interview Martin did not exhibit the obviously reckless behaviour, such as extreme weaving or stunt-type speeding, that would sustain a conviction on the more serious Criminal Code charge of dangerous driving causing injury, which could result in jail time. If police had the option of laying a Highway Traffic Act careless driving charge that included tougher penalties to reflect loss of life or serious injury, they would do so, Lalla said. “We deal with family members who are angry (at meager sentences), but our hands are tied because we have to deal with the law as it stands,” he said. MacPherson also read Martin's statement to the court, including Stevenson's brother Michael.  “I understand an apology will not be enough or change the amount of pain my actions have caused. However, I would like you to know how deeply and truly sorry I am...” said an obviously emotional MacPherson, who has prosecuted other drivers including the one who  . “I feel embarrassed and ashamed of my actions and that I have caused pain to innocent people. I have on many occasions hoped there was something I could have done differently and, although I am unable to change the past, I can learn from this to ensure it never happens again. “I wish that one day I can be forgiven for my actions, and please know that I will forever remember this day and be reminded of what my careless actions have brought.” ",0,Pedestrian killed by driver had just lost son 
"In Peel Region last year, over a span of less than four months, three pedestrians and one cyclist were killed by large transport trucks.  Drivers on the GTA’s busy highways commonly report dangers such as tires, rocks and large shards of ice that fly off trucks, but fatalities involving pedestrians and cyclists in the 905 who are increasingly forced to share local roads with these vehicles, get far less attention. “My nephew should still be alive. It was a needless accident,” said Gian Singh Kang, whose nephew was killed when he fell off his bicycle and was run over by the rear wheels of a transport truck in October 2015 while on his way to work at a factory.  “There was no lighting, no proper shoulder,” Kang said.  It was dark, in the early morning, when Hardeep Singh Pahra, a 30-year-old Brampton resident with a wife and two young children, was struck along Steeles Ave., west of Albion Rd. Peel police said the driver of the truck might not have even realized Pahra had been run over along the corridor, which police said is used heavily by commercial transport vehicles. No charges were laid in the case due to weather conditions and poor visibility, police said. Steeles Ave. is one of many commuter arteries across the 905 — where the population has exploded in the last two decades — that routinely sees a dangerous mix of large trucks, pedestrians and cyclists sharing spaces that seem incongruous for such use.  The province of Ontario had planned, among other transportation objectives, to reduce the volume of commercial truck traffic on municipal roads and commuter arteries with the creation of the GTA West Corridor, a proposed 400-series highway connecting York Region and Halton Region, but the plan was halted late last year by the Liberal government. The government has said it will provide an update on whether the plan will move forward “as soon as it’s available.” Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Bob Nichols said in an email that the province is a leader when it comes to truck safety. He said the number of deaths in Ontario involving trucks, including accidents with all vehicles, declined between 2003 and 2012 (there was a spike in 2007) despite the number of registered trucks increasing by 20 per cent over that period. In 2012 there were 100 deaths in accidents involving trucks, compared to 155 in 2003 (there were 170 in 2007), Nichols said.  As for pedestrian and cyclist safety, the president of the Ontario Trucking Association said that while better highway infrastructure for commercial vehicles would help with local traffic safety, it’s not a silver bullet.  “Wherever you see a house, place of business, retail store or manufacturing, there’s going to be a truck going in there,” said Steve Laskowski. “We’re dealing with infrastructure built 50-years ago for vehicles. The reality now is we have more and more people wanting to use the roads for more than just their vehicles — pedestrians and cyclists. If we could do it all over again, we would, but we don’t have the luxury.” Laskowski said there are three keys to reducing accidents between trucks and pedestrians or cyclists: education, enforcement of traffic laws and technology.  That technology includes semiautonomous commercial driving capabilities to detect dangers, to deal with blind spots and to break early. “We even have technology coming that won’t allow a cellphone to be used inside a truck while it’s in gear,” he said.  Such new technology probably wouldn’t have saved Diane Tsialtas.  A month before Pahra’s death, Tsialtas, a 49-year-old mother and grandmother, had been walking along Meadowvale Blvd. in an area of Mississauga with heavy commercial traffic when two wheels flew off a 14-wheel vehicle. One landed in a bush. The other wheel struck Tsialtas, who was on her way to work. A month earlier another pedestrian was killed by a transport truck on Airport Rd. in Mississauga, along a corridor with a mix of residential, commercial and industrial spaces. And in November last year, a 21-year-old Brampton man was hit and dragged under a transport truck on Kennedy Rd., just south of Steeles, before he died. It’s another corridor with a heavy volume of truck traffic. Peel police said in an email that municipal planners and engineers “are tasked with creating the safest road system possible. Regarding heavy volumes of truck traffic, the email states, “Traffic volume can be a problem for pedestrians and cyclists. It is important that the busiest streets should be travelled with the greatest caution and alertness.” Laskowski and Peel police said the 905 has municipal corridors with some of the heaviest truck volumes in North America, such as Dixie Rd., near the 401 Highway.  Kevin Montgomery, who frequently cycles and is co-chair of the City of Brampton’s cycling advisory committee, said some safety problems for cyclists and pedestrians are linked to poor planning that forces commercial trucks into transportation spaces shared by residential users. He also thinks that focusing on the “busiest streets” is the wrong approach. “That’s a critical consideration in the Active Transportation Master Plan that’s currently being developed through our committee and (Brampton) staff,” he said. His committee is looking at ways to separate cyclists from “trucks on transport corridors, but also higher volumes of fast-moving traffic . . . by way of multi-use pathways, completely separated bike lanes” and other infrastructure currently uncommon in the 905. Montgomery wants to see the “ ” approach in Brampton, which his committee is currently trying to implement. It’s the Scandinavian approach being looked at across much of the world now, including in Toronto. It shifts traffic safety away from just looking at hot spots.  “The goal has to be preventing every accident,” he said. “That might not be possible, but it should be the goal.” ",0,"In GTA suburbs, transport trucks and pedestrians can be a deadly combination"
"The collision occurred in a fraction of time, but almost three years later, Carolyn Skinner still relives it constantly. “I think about it all the time. When I’m crossing the street, I think about whether or not this is going to happen again,” Skinner said. This year Toronto has seen a  . People who were struck by cars while walking, like Skinner, comprise the majority of collisions involving motor vehicles and people who aren’t driving. But what do these collisions look like? There are many combinations of pedestrian-vehicle collisions, and the injuries that stem from such incidents are just as variable, according to doctors and paramedics. No two collisions are the same. It was March 2014 when Skinner crossed the street at a crosswalk and was struck by a turning vehicle. The toll on her body was immediate: she said she struck her head, fractured a rib and tore a ligament in her knee. It was almost a month before she was able to walk again. The 29-year-old has regular massage therapy sessions and visits to the chiropractor, and she dons a steel knee brace when she exercises but still she can’t shake her injuries. At the behest of her family and prompted by mood swings between anger and despondency over what happened, Skinner visited a psychologist earlier this year and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.  “When a car hits a person there is nothing you can do to have protected yourself other than stay home that day and not cross the street.” A city study published last year found that about 10,000 pedestrians were injured or killed on Toronto streets between 2008 and 2012. Of those, about 9 per cent — or 921 — resulted in major injuries. Furthermore, roughly 67 per cent of pedestrian injuries or fatalities in that period were due to driver error, the study concluded.  “There’s no rhyme or reason,” said Paul Roberts, a primary care paramedic in Toronto who’s been on the job for seven years. “I go through periods where there are very minor injuries; I go through periods where there are multiple, very serious injuries.” Roberts said that he often receives calls that a pedestrian has been struck, only to arrive on the scene and treat somebody who has only minor bumps and bruises. Sometimes people are able to walk away and they’re fine. But the worst case he’s seen — where the pedestrian survived, that is — involved a woman who was struck, fell under the vehicle and wound up pinned beneath a tire. He said that paramedics and attending police and firefighters managed to lift the car off the woman, and they were able to treat her. The goal is to get such patients to a hospital’s trauma unit, and into any required emergency surgery, within 60 minutes —“the golden hour of care,” Roberts said. David MacKinnon, deputy chief of the emergency department at St. Michael’s Hospital, said cyclists and pedestrians who need to be treated by the unit’s trauma team are often the ones who’ve suffered head injuries. Other serious cases involve organ injuries, and major abdominal or chest pain, he said. Broken bones are also common. “There is no doubt that when we hear it’s a pedestrian struck or a bicycle accident coming in, I guess our radar is up even before we’ve seen the patient,” MacKinnon said. For Skinner, the road to a complete recovery continues. Her case has not been settled yet, but she hopes to get a financial settlement to help pay for her therapy, she said. In the meantime, the city itself, with its relentless traffic, is a bustling reminder of the day more than three years ago, when her life changed. “It’s something I think about every couple of days, if not every day of my life, since the accident happened,” she said.

"Toronto’s red-light camera program is headed for a major expansion, a year after the devices appear to have resulted in a record number of charges against drivers.  Last week, Toronto officials announced plans that could see the number of cameras, currently installed at 77 locations across the city, effectively doubled. The expansion is being billed as part of the city’s new $80-million road safety plan, which Mayor John Tory has championed with the aim of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries. “I think the objective here is to get people to slow down and drive safely in school zones,  , places like that, to stop this carnage that’s been happening on the roads and to get (the number of traffic deaths) down to zero,” Tory said at a press conference last Tuesday, speaking in support of the cameras. Last year, 77 drivers, car passengers,   were killed on Toronto’s streets, the highest number of traffic fatalities in more than a decade.  According to city transportation data obtained by the Star, the red-light cameras, which allow authorities to remotely catch and ticket drivers who run red lights, were on track last year to net the most charges in any year since the program began.  The data covers the period from 2007 to the end of November 2016. Extrapolated through to the end of last year, the numbers indicate the program was on track for 36,230 red-light charges in 2016, which would be a 23.7-per-cent increase over 2015 and 3.6 per cent more than the previous high of 34,969 charges recorded in 2012.  The intersection with the most charges last year was Bathurst St. and Davenport Rd., which netted 2,490 tickets during the first 11 months of 2016. It displaced the previous top hot spot, Bayview Ave. and Truman Rd., which produced 1,885 tickets. Jane St. and Clair Rd. was third, with 1,225 tickets. (All the numbers refer to permanent red-light cameras. Between 2000 and 2012, the city also had a smaller number of temporary cameras that were rotated between several intersections.) Before 2016, the number of charges from the devices had decreased for three years in a row. Although the number of drivers being charged for running red lights is on the rise, city officials maintain that the cameras are effective in reducing crashes.  “Fortunately, a collision does not occur every time someone runs a red light,” said a spokesperson for transportation services. A 2015 city report found that the cameras reduced the number of angle collisions — which are often indicative of red-light running — that caused injuries by 37 per cent, and those that caused death were cut by 40 per cent. The number of rear-end collisions resulting in property damage actually increased 27 per cent after the cameras were introduced, but rear-end crashes resulting in injuries fell.  Roger Browne, manager of the city’s traffic safety unit, said the cameras have been “instrumental in helping to reduce collisions which, ultimately means preventing injuries and saving lives.” He added that there has also been a “halo effect” in which drivers are more cautious in the vicinity of red-light cameras, so that angle collisions at adjacent intersections have also been reduced. As part of the planned expansion, the city intends to install the devices at 76 new locations early this year. It will also review the existing camera locations to determine whether to maintain them. Officials say they’re not sure how many of the existing cameras they will keep, but if most of them are retained, the size of the program would almost double. The fine for running a red light is $325, which includes a $60 victim surcharge and $5 court cost. The city keeps $260 from each charge while the province collects the rest. Browne said revenue from the program totals about $7 million a year, while the cameras cost $2.3 million to operate.  Because the cameras can’t verify who was driving the vehicle at the time of the infraction, the fines are sent to the owner of the vehicle and no demerit points are issued. Although the cameras generate a profit, Tory stressed last week that the program is about preventing collisions, not padding municipal coffers. “As far as I’m concerned if they produced zero in terms of net revenue I would still be happy,” he said. Michael Black, co-founder of pedestrian advocacy group  , said the money the cameras generate is definitely a plus.  “The beauty of safety cameras is they’re very effective and they also pay for themselves,” he said.  Black argued there are many elements of the road safety plan, which includes lower speed limits and turning prohibitions, that “simply won’t work without enforcement,” and that automated technology is the best way to make sure drivers follow the rules. A single camera can monitor an intersection much more effectively than a police officer — and at significantly lower cost. Elliott Silverstein, manager of government relations for the  , said more than 70 per cent of its members support the use of red-light cameras.  But Silverstein said the support is conditional on the cameras’ use as a safety measure and not a revenue stream. Funds collected from the cameras should be reinvested into safety initiatives, he argued, and the expansion of the program should be accompanied by public education efforts.  Lewis Smith, a spokesperson for the  , said cities can combat the perception that cameras are a cash grab by giving drivers ample warning of where the devices are. In Toronto, all intersections that have cameras are signed. “The important thing for cities to do, if the main goal is really prevention as opposed to punishment after the fact, is to make it very clear that there’s a red-light camera there,” Smith said.

"BUFFALO, N.Y. — Kevin Kline flicked his cigarette and considered the recent transformation of his city’s main drag. He turned around and found the perfect example: an ornate, 19th-century brick arcade. It used to be so dead that the municipality bought the building in the 90s to save it from the wrecking ball, he said. Now it’s connected to a busy market with food stalls and a pub and houses the art centre where he works as education director. Like many Buffalonians up and down Main St., Kline credits much of the action to the four-wheeled mainstays of modern life: motor vehicles. They were outlawed on the central stretch of Buffalo for the better part of three decades, only to return in recent years as the city revamps the downtown artery block-by-block, making room for two-way car traffic and parking alongside bike lanes and the tracks previously reserved for the train that has rattled through the central corridor since 1986. As   spike in Toronto this year — and the city prepares for a car-free pilot project on a portion of King St. W. — Buffalo offers an intriguing counter-example to the push to make room for non-motorized modes of transport on city streets. The return of cars on Main St. is seen by many as a vital part of a downtown renaissance in the city across the Niagara River. “Buffalo is a driving city, and when a strip this long doesn’t have traffic,” said Kline, pausing to think. “It’s been a lot nicer having people on the ground.” Further south, Autumn Reinard was scooping ice cream for customers, one of two businesses she has helped open on Main St. in the past six months. “It’s been awesome,” she said between hearty descriptions of the stuffed pretzels and spiced ciders on offer in the shop. “It brings a lot more people in, even if they’re just getting change for the meter. It’s been more alive and more positive.” To make sense of this, one must dial back the clock to the 1970s. Where once Buffalo was a vibrant industrial centre of the Great Lakes region, a powerhouse place that housed the legal office of President Grover Cleveland, the city was in decline by the second half of the 20th century, explained Daniel Hess, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Architecture and Planning. The downtown core fell dormant, like many similar-sized cities, as residents flocked to the lawn-scapes and shopping malls of the surrounding suburbs. “All the industry and manufacturing was gone,” said Hess. “It’s a city built for 600,000 people and now it’s less than 300,000.” To kickstart business and activity in the city centre, planners started working on a scheme for Main St. The idea was to bring in a street car line to connect the banks and shopping centres along the street, Hess said, but also try to replicate the suburban mall experience with a pedestrian promenade. Trains would rattle by routinely, and there would be no cars. The city hired a Toronto-based firm, Moriyama & Teshima, to design the strip, and construction began in 1979. Workers ripped up the street, installed tracks and expanded the sidewalks, and the pedestrian mall was finished by the mid-80s. The whole thing came to be seen as a mistake by a lot of people, said Hess. “The death of the downtown was given a generous helping hand by taking cars away,” he said. Alan Dewart, a local real estate developer involved in several projects along Main St., said the area became a “dead zone.” Many businesses shut down, and there was a dearth of pedestrians on the expanded promenades. “It was a real, real bad part of Buffalo’s downtown history. It didn’t work, in a nutshell,” Dewart said. The city decided it was time to change direction in 2008. It began with a US$2.8 million refurbishment of the area around Shea’s Theater, a historic venue in the city. Curb planters and new benches were installed, along with bike lanes and the re-introduction of two-way motor vehicle traffic. That was followed by the US$21-million reconstruction of the 500 Block of the street, as well as a $8-million US construction on the 600 Block. The new streetscape was followed by upgrades to the hockey arena complex that hosts the Buffalo Sabres — which sits at the southern end of Main St., beyond a stretch that still has several boarded up storefronts where the pedestrian mall hasn’t been revamped — as well as new real estate projects. Buffalo’s mayor, Byron Brown, said in 2014 that the initiative has given the city a 2-to-1 return on its investment. “It’s been very, very successful,” said Dewart, adding that it’s clear in hindsight that the car-free Main St. was a mistake. “It’s amazing how so much time and money and blood and sweat could have been saved,” he said. “You’d think they should have known.” But don’t go rushing off to City Hall in a bid to keep cars rolling through all of Toronto’s main drags. Hess, the University at Buffalo professor, points out that Toronto and Buffalo are very different cities. He suggested Toronto may be more like New York City, where car-free projects in Manhattan are seen as a progressive means to make room for pedestrians and cyclists on already-jammed streets. “I think there could be similar conditions in Toronto,” he said. Either way, Amie Ford is happy with how downtown Buffalo is changing. Her only concern is that she has to remind herself to listen and look for cars when she crosses Main St. “It was probably less lively back then,” she said. “You see people walking dogs and everything now.” ",0,Return of cars to Buffalo street is vital part of downtown renaissance
"Erinn Davis and Alex Tushingham braced themselves to see the motorist who had killed their beloved dad Bruce, to tell her how a lapse behind the wheel was ravaging their family. “The devastation and shock of our loss affects all of us every moment of every day,” Alex read from a victim impact statement his family had tearfully crafted. But driver Nora Jones never heard that because she was not in court. Alex poured his heart out to a room that was empty except for people paid to be there and a few spectators waiting for the next traffic case. Jones’s legal representative pleaded guilty on her behalf to unsafely leaving a Markham roadway, reduced from careless driving, in August 2013. A justice of the peace fined her $500. Case closed. It never crossed Davis’s mind the driver could stay home. Her family did know, though, that the violent death of a fit, loving 63-year-old cyclist — who had met his grandson the day he was born and returned the next with a photo of him on his T-shirt — would be reduced to a minor traffic violation. “The charge was no different if she hit a mailbox, or nothing, or killed my dad,” Davis says. “There’s no part of the charge that relates to the outcome, which is the crazy part.” With pedestrians and cyclists dying on Toronto streets   — more than 40 so far this year — safety advocates are demanding reforms to lax penalties in hopes of saving lives. “We give the car a special status in society,” says Patrick Brown, a Toronto lawyer who has argued civil suits for grieving families of dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. “If you want to look at your phone or talk at length to your kid, your car is becoming a weapon … If you use any other weapon to kill someone, like negligent discharge of a gun, you will face very severe penalties.” While there is sometimes anger at the drivers, it’s Ontario laws that dictate penalties. Brown believes car bias is baked into our laws, into how police investigate and question drivers, and finally into drivers’ sentencing at court. Theoretically, drivers can face up to 10 years in jail under a criminal charge of dangerous driving causing injury, up to six months in jail and a fine of $2,000 for the provincial offence of careless driving, or they can face an $85 fine for a minor traffic offence such as an improper turn. Legal observers say courts almost never give the maximums and usually accept plea bargains to less serious charges. There are many examples of motorists paying less than $1,000 for actions that killed a person. By contrast, Ontario courts have also fined a tourist $1,000 for hunting a bear with a spear, developers $5,000 for each illegally removed tree and a man $2,000 for drunkenly driving a riding mower. Reached by phone, Jones — who told police her sandal got caught on the gas pedal, sending her car to the shoulder and then across the road head-on into Bruce Tushingham — tearfully refused to comment on her penalty. The wife of Alvito Abreu, who was 79   $2,000 and handed a six-month partial driving ban after killing 4-year-old Milad Sher-Ahmad, refused to put her husband on the phone. “He has been through so much stress and I don’t want to put him through any more,” she said. “His health has deteriorated. We are people in our 80s and it’s really very, very painful.” Asked if the penalty for careless driving — running a Mississauga stop sign and turning left into an intersection, and the boy — was appropriate, she said: “I’ve accepted that and that’s it. I pray for the family every day and it was not intentional.” More than 10,000 Toronto pedestrians and 5,000 cyclists were killed or seriously injured by motorists between 2008 and 2012. For the pedestrians, according to  , the vast majority had the right of way. David Stark, whose wife Erica was fatally struck while standing on a Scarborough sidewalk in 2014, resulting in  , co-founded Friends and Families for Safe Streets. The group is pushing for safer road design but also the adoption of “ ” laws, with significantly tougher penalties, first introduced in Oregon. If motorists recklessly kill someone, they should face fines in the $50,000 range, Stark says. Drivers convicted in fatal crashes should be forced to attend court so they hear victim impact statements, he adds, and get significant driving bans and be forced to perform community service. “Where we are now with distracted driving is where we were a generation ago with drunk driving,” says Stark. “It’s going to take some time for public opinion to shift and for people to realize it’s not acceptable for me to be tapping away on my phone” while driving. Edward Sapiano, a lawyer who successfully challenged a Toronto police account of Tom Samson’s death that  , says new laws are not the answer. “We need the police to investigate the death of pedestrians and bicyclists like they investigate all other homicides,” with appropriate resources and trained investigators. “They have plenty of (laws) — dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm, impaired causing death, manslaughter. It’s the investigations that are deficient.” Last June, provincial Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca told Metro news he was “open-minded” about additional penalties or fines. Six months and many fatalities later, he told the Star much the same. Transportation staff continue to look at options. “I don’t mind continuing to work on this, that doesn’t bother me in the least, it is part of my responsibility, but I want to make sure if we’re going to go forward and we have a plan, it’s a plan that is more likely to work than not, and I think that requires a little more time … ” Del Duca said. “I completely respect the frustration and the impatience that some people are feeling and we’ll have more to say, I think, in the relatively near future.” Davis, meanwhile, chokes up describing her sons growing up robbed of a “super-involved” grandpa. “Stiffer penalties won’t help me, I still lost my dad, but maybe they’ll make people think twice about being distracted by the radio, or their coffee, or their shoe, or whatever,” she says. “If everyone is more focused, in less of a hurry and more conscious of others, maybe other families won’t be devastated like mine was.

"Drivers and pedestrians can sometimes make mistakes that lead to collisions, but some hazards are built right into our roads. Take for example the triple interchange at Eglinton Ave. E., Victoria Park Ave., and O’Connor Dr. Since 2010, at least four   have been killed at or near the high-speed intersection. It’s expected that more pedestrians will frequent the area in the coming years, once a station for the new Eglinton Crosstown LRT opens. The Star spoke to experts about physical alterations that would make the crossroads safer. “This is a massive intersection with tons of space for cars. Completely ‘unbalanced,’” said Gil Penalosa, founder of 8-80 Cities. “Overall, much space needs to be re-allocated to other modes.” ",0,How to fix deadly Toronto intersection at Eglinton and Victoria Park
"“Car accident” or “car crash”? “Pedestrian” or “vulnerable road user”? “Traffic collision” or a case of “road violence”? As safety advocates push for physical changes to Toronto’s roads to combat a rising tide of pedestrian deaths, they’re also waging a parallel, more abstract struggle to change the way news media, the police and the public talk about traffic collisions. This year, the city is   more than usual. As of Dec. 2, there had been more than 40 pedestrian deaths in 2016, the most in a calendar year since at least 2005. The language used to describe these incidents has “extraordinary power,” said Maureen Coyle, of Walk Toronto. “It contextualizes. It politicizes or depoliticizes.” Coyle said she bristles when she reads reports about collisions that don’t mention the driver. As an example, she cites the phrase “a white Subaru struck a woman in an intersection.” “Well, the white Subaru did no such thing. It was the driver of the Subaru,” she said. “If somebody took a hammer to a person, we wouldn’t say the hammer hit the individual. We don’t say the gun shot the person. We talk about the chain of responsibility.” At a rally earlier this year, Coyle and other advocates with the Friends and Family for Safe Streets stood outside city hall with signs demanding an end to “road violence.” The term evokes parallels to other societal scourges like gun violence (which so far this year has killed 36 people), and may sound like a radical way to describe a daily occurrence on our roads. But according to Vision Zero Canada director Graham Larkin, the phrase isn’t new. It dates back to the dawn of the automobile age in North America, when drivers killing pedestrians was still a novel and alarming phenomenon. To Larkin, the fact that the term has faded from popular use since the early 20th century is a troubling sign that society has come to accept people dying on our roads. “We lost. It got naturalized, it got normalized,” he said. He said that advocates who are bringing back the term are declaring “the fight is on again.” “There’s a new sense of awareness... that we have the right to safe mobility,” he said. Like most road safety advocates, Larkin objects to the term “accident” to describe collisions. “It’s inherently presumptuous if you don’t even know the circumstances to describe it as an ‘accident,’” he said. The term “accident” could be taken to mean that no one was at fault. But in Toronto, the majority of pedestrian injuries appear to involve driver error. A 2015 Toronto Public Health report found that in 67 per cent of cases where pedestrians were hurt in a crash, the pedestrian had the right of way. Earlier this year The Associated Press amended its style guide to state that “it’s best to avoid” the word “accident” in cases where “negligence is claimed or proven in a collision.” Kathy English, the Toronto Star’s public editor, said the newspaper has no specific policy about reporting traffic collisions, but given the growing public concern about the issue “it’s a matter that’s worth giving serious consideration.” But while she said conventional ways of writing about collisions may need to be re-examined, she also pointed out there can be valid concerns behind the decision to leave drivers’ actions out of reports. “For legal reasons, we can’t write something that convicts somebody, that says they did it. So we have to be really careful,” she said. Const. Clint Stibbe, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service traffic services, said he always uses “collision” in his news releases. The exception is when he announces charges against drivers and quotes the provincial Highway Traffic Act or the Criminal Code of Canada. Both use the word “accident” to describe car crashes.

"Why do Toronto’s busiest streets and highways sometimes feel like combat zones? There are many theories on why people become angry behind the wheel of a car, says Christine Wickens, a scientist with CAMH’s Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, who has studied driver aggression. “Most people who are generally hostile are going to be generally hostile on the roadway as well,” Wickens says citing one widely accepted theory. Human beings are also territorial by nature, so “there’s this personal space around your vehicle, and you don’t want it to be invaded.” Another theory is that the anonymity of driving fuels bad behaviour. “If someone cuts you off on the highway, chances are they can’t see you. You’ll probably never come across them again,” she says. “But if it happens in your driveway, and you and your neighbour pulled out at the same time, and nearly hit each other, would you be just as likely to get out and scream and yell and rant and rave? Probably not.” Wickens was the lead author of a recent   that found angry, aggressive drivers are much more likely to get into crashes than calmer motorists. Toronto is also an increasingly crowded place to move around in which will invariably amp up stress and tension levels on city streets, says Murtaza Haider, director of the Institute of Housing and Mobility at Ryerson University. An estimated 20 million people cross the Yonge St. and Dundas St. intersection every year, he notes. “Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, transit vehicles are all trying to share the same space. And given the intensity of interactions you see, at times, conflicts,” he says. “Fortunately most conflicts are someone honking or using their fingers creatively.” And while the city has Manhattanized, with condo towers shooting up all around us, no new roads have been built, “so road capacity has remained the same, but the number of users has multiplied tremendously.” Commuters trying to get in and out of the city, meanwhile, are battling gridlock and coping with the uncertainty of their travel times. That “lack of control” also boosts stress levels and exacerbates tensions, Haider says. He warns Toronto is getting to the stage “where we have built as much commercial, office, retail and residential that any further increases will just increase friction between cars, automobiles, pedestrians and bikes and within bicyclists themselves.” Jared Kolb, executive director of Cycle Toronto, noticed how “stressed” he became the moment he got back on his bicycle on Toronto streets after a trip to Copenhagen, where bikes travel along a 390-km network of designated lanes. Toronto has just 131-km of on-street bike lanes or separated cycle tracks. The city needs to invest heavily in cycling infrastructure and “really carve out space so cyclists have a space and drivers have a space, he says. More people will opt to bike to work, rather than drive, if they feel they can arrive alive. “To really dial down the stress on the roads, we really need to dial up our investment in protected bike lanes right across the city.” ",0,Experts explain why Toronto streets can feel like a battlefield
"A lot has changed for Mary Forrest since her husband and daughter dropped her off at a street corner near Lawrence West subway station almost seven years ago. She remembers walking on the sidewalk and seeing a car coming towards her “a little too fast.” The next thing she can recall is waking up in a hospital bed, she thinks, a few days later. Forrest, says she then found out that she’d been hit by that car and was told her skull had cracked and blood had gushed out of her ear. The better part of a decade later, the 50-year-old North York resident still has trouble hearing. She says she’s lost her sense of taste and smell, suffers vertigo, panic attacks and has trouble remembering things. Forrest’s lingering injuries are symptoms of what some health workers, researchers and Toronto city staff are now recognizing as a public health problem:  In a city where police say more than 1500 pedestrian and almost 950 cyclist collisions had been reported in 2016 up to the end of October, Forrest is not alone. “We are exposed to this day in and day out,” said Joanne Banfield, manager of trauma injury prevention at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital. “It becomes very frustrating for us day after day having to treat people who are here because of a preventable injury.” In November, Sunnybrook’s trauma centre saw a 20.7 per cent hike in pedestrian injuries in 2016, compared to the same time last year. “There are no additions to the healthcare teams, but we still have to manage this,” Banfield said. “We can’t maintain the status quo right now. I mean if we continue with these high numbers of injured people, the health care system can’t accommodate it.” She thinks collaboration and prevention are key to addressing traffic safety in Toronto. For Amanda McFarlan, a Toronto cyclist and pedestrian who manages the trauma program registry at Saint Michael’s Hospital, road safety is something she thinks about both during her commute and at her job. “We consider trauma as a preventable disease, generally speaking in all its forms, so we very seldom use the word accident,” said McFarlan.  “These are all preventable injuries, and there are predictable factors that are associated with many of these injuries — speed, attention, alcohol are all things you can fix.” McFarlan thinks traffic safety can be improved through safer infrastructure, better lighting on roads, lower speed limits and enforcement of traffic rules. Ward Vanlaar, chief operating officer of the Traffic Injury Research Foundation in Ottawa, said until the last decade or so, road safety was thought of as a transportation issue. “The take on it was that we have a price to pay for mobility, and the price is that certain people will die and that was considered to be acceptable,” he said. Vanlaar said that in recent years he’s seen a shift in thinking about traffic safety, both globally and across Canada. “People working in this field, and also in other health-related fields have had this epiphany almost, like ‘Hey, there are really a lot of people dying,’” he said. When people started seeing road safety as a health issue, he said, the approach to address it also changed. Many cities around the world are now designing themselves with safety prioritized over mobility. “Essentially you’re acknowledging that human beings are prone to making mistakes, and if you accept that then you accept that we have to design a transportation system that will mitigate those risks and will basically eliminate those instances where, because of human error, people will die.” The approach he is describing,  , originated in Sweden and has since been adopted in many cities around the world. Toronto’s 2017-2021 road safety plan says it will adopt this approach too. The World Health Organization calls traffic-related deaths and injuries “a major health and development concern” and estimates that about 1.25 million people die on roads around the world every year. Cutting the number of global deaths from road traffic collisions in half by 2020 is a United Nations’ goal, included in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The U.N. says almost half of those who die on the world’s roads are not people in cars. “People are risking their lives every time they leave their homes,” said UN Environment’s Erik Solheim in statement released this past October. “But it isn’t just about accidents. Designing transport systems around cars puts more vehicles on the road, increasing both greenhouse gas emissions and deadly air pollution. We must put people, not cars, first in transport systems.” Closer to home, Monica Campbell, a spokesperson for Toronto Public Health, said traffic safety falls within the realm of her department. “If you invest in safer roads, safer streets, better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians – does that reduce the burden on the healthcare system? Absolutely it does,” she said. Toronto’s new road safety plan notes that active modes of transportation – such as biking and walking – have health advantages, but also that those modes put the people who use them at a higher risk of serious injuries from collisions than those who commute in cars or on public transit. “We’ve been concerned about this for a while, as we do more research we understand the need and the benefit of better road design” said Campbell. She said public health’s contribution to the city’s new road safety plan will come by way of research and an education push: an effort to make sure health is considered within the city’s future infrastructure. While Toronto’s new road safety plan is set to get fully underway in the New Year, the city has already seen more than 40 pedestrians killed on its roads this year, making 2016 the deadliest in at least a decade for the city’s walking commuters. Every time she hears of a pedestrian or cyclist who has been struck, it makes Forrest cringe. She knows too well that the repercussions of a split-second hit can last much longer than the coverage they’re given on the daily news. “Anything you can think of has forever changed for me,” she said. “But you can’t see it because I look fine.” While there are no longer the reminders posted around Forrest’s house prompting her to turn off the oven or unplug the iron — like the ones she used to need right after the accident — her life hasn’t been the same since Jan. 22, 2010. Over the years, her family has helped her fill in many of the gaps in her memory the collision seemed to wipe out. Forrest is now on long-term disability, after she made an attempt to go back to work.  “I want to be who I was,” she said. “… and I can’t get any of that back.” ",0,Healthcare workers call trauma from road collisions a ‘preventable disease’
"Every morning when she visited her family in North York, Foroughalsadat Abtahi — “Fufu to her grandchildren — went for a walk. On Oct. 11, just minutes into her daily stroll, the 81-year-old woman was struck by a Toyota Corolla that jumped the curb, and she was killed. It was a tragic shock to her family, both here and in her native Iran, as Abtahi joined the list of seniors who represent the largest age-group killed each year while walking the streets of Toronto. “You never expect it to happen,” said Abtahi’s grandson, Ryon Dalir, an 18-year-old student at Ryerson University. “It was devastating,” he said. “(Seniors) are probably the most cautious people out there… It’s saddening.” In Canada’s biggest city, the words “elderly pedestrian struck” are familiar terms in police press releases. On Nov. 28, a 72-year-old man died after he was hit by a car on Bathurst St, according to police. In October,   in separate collisions over just three days along a single street: Eglinton Ave. Shortly after, Abtahi was killed. Const. Clint Stibbe, the Toronto Police Service’s traffic specialist, said people 65 and older account for roughly 60 per cent of pedestrian traffic deaths in the city each year — 80 per cent if you include people who are at least 55. “That is a staggering number for one demographic,” Stibbe said. Older people are also more susceptible to injuries sustained from being hit by a car. A broken bone can take longer to heal, for example, and as Stibbe pointed out, for elderly pedestrians who are struck, “quite often the original injury is not what results in the person’s death, but the complications that arise from that injury.” In response to a coroner’s report in  , the Liberal government at Queen’s Park brought in a new law to increase fines for drivers that don’t stop and yield the entire roadway to pedestrians when there is a crossing guard. That report found that 36 per cent of pedestrians killed in Ontario in 2010 were seniors, even though they account for just 13 per cent of the provincial population. Marie Smith, a former president of the United Senior Citizens of Ontario, has appealed to the province and municipalities for further changes, including increasing the period of time given to pedestrians when they cross at intersections. “The lights aren’t long enough for older people with walkers or even someone in a wheelchair,” Smith said. “Everybody’s in such a rush that nobody stops to be careful anymore,” she added. “And they’re also on their cellphone or their iPad or whatever it is they’re doing, and they’re just not paying attention.” Albert Koehl, a Toronto lawyer who pushed for the 2012 report and consulted with Smith’s group and several others, said he’d like to see the province push harder to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. He said the vulnerability of seniors is “an obvious problem” that could be addressed by lower speed limits in the short term and better designed streets in the years to come. “It’s shameful that so many seniors are dying without their being outrage at the city council and provincial level,” Koehl said. Koehl pointed out that the 2012 coroner’s report recommended lower default speed limits on residential and arterial roads, while Toronto’s medical officer of health called for the same thing that year. He said he’d like to see the city follow Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and others that have lowered speed limits and set up photo radar to deter those driving too fast. A University of Alberta study from 2014, for example, clocked a 32.1 per cent decrease in fatal and injury collisions after the introduction of photo radar. “It’s not something that should catch us by surprise,” Koehl said. “The default speed should be the safe speed.” Meanwhile, Dalir said he hopes some lesson can come from his grandmother’s sudden and unexpected death. “I don’t trust the drivers on our streets anymore. Maybe when I was younger but not anymore,” he said. ",0,Streets more dangerous for Toronto seniors
"Nicole Burnat has ordered Christmas gifts for her daughter that she won’t ever get to give. Earlier this month, Burnat’s daughter Madeleine Petrielli, who would have turned 16 on Dec. 14, was struck and killed while walking home with her boyfriend, Thomas Grant. The traffic light on Britannia Rd. in Mississauga was amber, and the walk sign hadn’t yet lit up when the young couple began to cross the road, Grant said. As Madeleine continued forward, she was struck. Police said paramedics at the scene and doctors at the hospital tried but couldn’t save her. Police said speed was not a factor. Grant said his girlfriend never saw the car. A Swedish-born approach to traffic safety, Vision Zero, says none of that should matter — that no one should die on the road, even if they make a mistake. When thinking about the spot where her daughter was hit, Burnat is left reeling with uncertainty. She said there were no street lights, and the street on the other side was only marginally lit. “What if the street lights were working?” she asked. “Would this have happened? Would Madeleine be with me?” Graham Larkin is executive director at Vision Zero Canada, an advocacy group working to raise awareness nationwide about the approach to pedestrian safety. When asked about what happened to Madeleine in Mississauga, he said that police should never say speed isn’t a factor, since he believes it always is. Larkin said the multi-lane intersection where Madeleine was killed was designed for cars, not people. That sort of car-centric design, Larkin said, pushes commuters to drive instead of walk or bike to where they need to go — something he believes makes roads both more congested and dangerous. Awaiting budget approval, Toronto says it will join a growing list of cities, including New York, Edmonton, San Francisco and Seattle, in adopting a Vision Zero approach to traffic safety in 2017. The idea deems safety more important than speed and follows a philosophy that “no loss of life is acceptable.” In a news release on Dec. 5, the Toronto Police Service said 2016 has seen more fatal collisions than any year since at least 2005. More than 40 pedestrians have died so far, representing more than half of all traffic deaths in Toronto this year, the release said. Peel Region spokesperson Ken Chiu said the region doesn’t yet have a stand on Vision Zero, but officials there are discussing the new approach. He said Peel is currently seeking public input on how to move ahead with a new transportation safety plan. Chiu said the new strategy is expected to be developed and released next year, “so we’ll have clarity on Vision Zero or any elements they may borrow from Vision Zero for a made-in-Peel solution with targets and visions reflective of our network,” he wrote in an email. “Staff are trying to focus on real outcomes and what can be achieved.” In Toronto’s case, some critics say the city’s plan comes up short, lacking the political will, substance and money to back up the promise in its name and its ambitious target. While data collection being done by the city is an important step forward, Larkin said he’s concerned that some of the educational components of its plan take an old-school approach: the onus is on road users to keep themselves and others safe, instead of the infrastructure explicitly protecting them. When Toronto first unveiled its five-year road safety plan in June, its goal was to cut traffic-related deaths and injuries by 20 per cent over the next decade. A month later, city council unanimously endorsed a much heftier aim: cutting the number of road deaths and injuries to zero as part of its five-year plan. With a budget of just over $80 million — about $12 million more than had been promised — the plan passed. When drafting this new road strategy, Toronto compared itself with other Vision Zero cities in North America. The city’s traffic safety unit manager, Roger Browne, calls Sweden an inspiration and New York a mentor. Browne said he didn’t want to comment on the collision that killed Madeleine Petrielli as it took place in a different municipality. But he noted that pedestrian safety is emphasized in Toronto’s new plan. He said some of the measures the city is working on include longer pedestrian crossings, new zebra markings and new speed signs on more than a dozen roads where limits have been reduced by 10 kilometres per hour. Critics of Toronto’s plan say its zero target is unrealistic considering the actions outlined to make it happen. Vision Zero Canada’s Larkin suggested Toronto should look globally at cities as examples to emulate — instead of focusing on those closer to home that have recently shifted to Vision Zero. “For us, you have to start to think in a different way to solve your safety problems,” said Matts-Ake Belin, project leader with the Vision Zero Academy in Sweden. “When I see it from outside, I’m not sure all cities — for instance in the U.S. and some cities in Canada — really understand some of the basic philosophy underpinning Vision Zero.” It assumes some human error is inevitable and puts the responsibility on governments and infrastructure to mitigate that risk. It is not the job of pedestrians to wear reflective gear to be seen, but instead the city’s job to make it safe for them to walk, no matter what. “It’s not rocket science. It is quite easy,” Belin said. “The problem is to get political support for these sorts of things … you need very strong political leadership to make these things happen.” In Toronto, that will may or may not exist, depending on who you ask. Browne says the city’s plan is to jump all in. “This is a fundamental shift in the way transportation services is going to be delivering safety,” he said. “We are taking a much more strategic approach as opposed to opportunistic, and that’s huge.” Browne said he believes the plan can succeed. “It’s something we really have to strive to achieve … we have everything in place we need to deliver on this.” Browne said the plan is data-driven and will target the parts of the city that are most dangerous for the most vulnerable road users. Torontonians’ ability to get where they need to go quickly, he claims, will not conflict with making the city safer. Maureen Coyle of Walk Toronto, a pedestrian advocacy group, doesn’t see it that way. “You can’t do both at the same time,” she said. “You can’t keep moving cars and move them faster and ‘more efficiently’ without those vehicles driving into people on a regular basis.” She said making such a big change might not be a popular move politically across the board. “But it’s particularly hard to argue when the number of serious injuries goes down,” she said, pointing to New York’s experience after adopting Vision Zero. Though she doesn’t doubt its intentions, Coyle has been vocal about her view that the city’s financial commitment to the plan is not bold enough. While the city does intend to lower speed limits in targeted areas, it’s an approach Coyle thinks should be more widespread. Cities such as New York and, more recently, Boston have agreed to lower default city speeds, which Toronto is opting to do only in select areas. In Canada, Edmonton claims to be the country’s first major city to adopt Vision Zero. It did so in 2015. Asked about whether adopting this approach clashes with Toronto’s strong car culture, Gerry Shimko, executive director of Edmonton’s office of traffic safety, said, “Well, we ask the fundamental question: how many people should die in your family as a result of a motor vehicle collision? And we’ve yet to meet anyone that says anything other than zero.” Back in Toronto, there’s still a gift for Madeleine in her mother’s kitchen. Feeling proud of how well her daughter had been doing in school, Burnat attempted to get everything on her daughter’s birthday and Christmas list. When she spoke with the Star, Burnat had the sock her daughter was wearing when she died tucked inside her pocket. Burnat picked it up from the side of the road that night. “I really had a good, good girl,” Burnat said. “I did.” ",0,Could teen’s tragic death crossing street have been prevented?

"Older citizens bore the brunt of a   in Toronto last year. Statistics released to the Star by the Toronto police this week confirmed that last year was the deadliest for the city’s pedestrians in more than a decade, with 43 people killed by drivers. That’s the highest death toll since at least 2005, the oldest year on record in data recently released by the city. The figures show that last year also saw the highest number of older people killed on the streets in a decade. Thirty-seven of the victims, or 86 per cent, were over 55, which is the age the city’s   uses to define “older adults.” The demographic makes up about a quarter of the population.  Although older people regularly account for a disproportionate number of traffic injuries, the percentage of deaths for those older than 55 was the highest in a single year since at least 2005. People aged 65 and older made up 67 per cent of victims last year. The numbers “are of great concern to us,” said Adina Lebo, chair of the downtown chapter of CARP, a seniors’ advocacy group. She said with the city’s older population set to double to 1.2 million in the next 25 years, the city “really has to look into what we’re going to do in Toronto to make life safer for an aging population.” Public works chair Councillor Jaye Robinson (Ward 25, Don Valley West) called the numbers “alarming.”  Robinson, who is the mayor’s lead for the road safety plan, said the city is taking action to specifically protect older pedestrians by creating “senior safety zones” that will feature measures like additional midblock crossings, lower speed limits, better lighting and signage, and longer pedestrian crossing times at signalized intersections.  The zones combine measures already announced in the road safety plan, and would be created in areas frequented by older citizens such as community centres, Robinson said.  The councillor said the city will release more information in the coming weeks about how many of the zones will be implemented, and will start setting them up this month.  “We want to address it in a very aggressive manner,” she said.  Maureen Coyle, a gerontologist and member of   steering committee, agreed that more needs to be done to protect seniors. But she criticized the city’s strategy of enacting seniors safety zones only in specific areas. “Seniors are everywhere,” Coyle said. “How about we just have a broad-based, broadly enacted, universal plan to make our roads safer?” Council   in July. It will see the city spend $80.3 million over five years on protective measures focused on older adults, children, pedestrians, cyclists, and deterring aggressive and distracted driving. The investment has been characterized by safety advocates as too modest to significantly reduce road deaths. In an email Keerthana Kamalavasan, a spokesperson for Mayor John Tory, said the road safety plan “presents a smart, targeted, collaborative approach to reducing injuries and fatalities on our streets.” She said that since council approved the plan, the city has created 14 “pedestrian safety corridors,” installed 400 new speed signs, shortened pedestrian crossing distances at 14 locations, increased crossing times at 37 intersections, and moved forward with plans for red light cameras at 79 locations.  The mayor believes the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured last year “is both alarming and unacceptable,” Kamalavasan said, noting that Tory held an emergency meeting with the police and transportation department last month to discuss the problem. “We must do more to prevent these deaths and protect our residents across the city.” The pedestrian death count provided by the police was slightly lower than figures tallied by the Star’s sister publication, Metro News, and previously cited in the Star.  A spokesperson for the police said the force omitted at least one incident that was later deemed a homicide, and that the police figures don’t include deaths on provincially-owned highways within Toronto’s borders. Although by some measures traffic deaths are getting worse, at least one statistic is moving in the right direction. Only one cyclist died on Toronto’s roads last year, the fewest since 2009. In the four years prior to 2016, cyclist fatalities fluctuated between three and four annually. Jared Kolb, executive director of  , said that while one death is still one too many, he believes the expansion of the city’s bike lane network is beginning to bear fruit.  “I don’t think we can say at this point that cycling across the city is safer than ever. But what we can say is more people are riding, and that’s a direct result of more infrastructure on our city streets,” he said, asserting that more people using bike lanes has created a “safety-in-numbers effect.” According to the police, in total there were 1,958 pedestrian collisions and 1,070 cyclist collisions reported last year.

"Just before a minivan struck and killed Erica Stark, the vehicle had jumped the curb, run over a TTC bus stop pole, careered off a hydro box and slammed into a light standard. But even after the van hit those objects, it was still travelling with sufficient velocity when it struck Stark that police would later tell her husband she was thrown at a speed of between 34 km/h and 43 km/h. She was standing on the sidewalk when the van left the road, and when it collided with her, Stark’s head smashed into the windshield. When she was thrown in the air, she hit her head again on the pavement. The 42-year-old mother of three died at the scene from a combination of blunt force trauma and internal bleeding. Her death, on Nov. 6, 2014, ripped a hole in her family. “Not a day goes by when we don’t think of Erica and how our lives have been permanently changed by what happened,” David Stark, her husband of 17 years,  . The driver of the minivan, Elizabeth Taylor,  , and given a $1,000 fine, six months probation and a one-month driving ban. Two witnesses testified that Taylor was driving fast on Midland Ave., a wide four-lane road, before she struck Erica Stark at the intersection of Gilder Dr., but the presiding justice of the peace determined there was no evidence that Taylor was going above the posted speed limit of 50 km/h. David Stark, for his part, finds it hard to believe that speed wasn’t a significant factor. And although how fast Taylor was travelling may never be determined, there is no question there is a strong connection between high speeds and traffic deaths. Despite convincing evidence that slowing down saves lives, Toronto has refused to endorse what advocates say could be the most effective way to prevent more deaths: lowering the city’s default speed limit to 40 km/h from 50 km/h. “I would go so far as to say that if the Toronto road safety plan doesn’t incorporate extensive speed limit reductions then we’re not going to see a big decrease in pedestrian fatalities,” said Michael Black, co-founder of the advocacy group Walk Toronto. He argued that lowering the default limit by 10 km/h would “likely reduce fatalities and injuries on Toronto’s roads more effectively than any other measure.” Toronto is in the midst of a record year for traffic deaths. So far, more than 40 pedestrians have died in 2016, more than any other year in at least a decade. Seniors are bearing the brunt of the crisis — they make up 14 per cent of the population, but represent more than 60 per cent of pedestrian fatalities. Despite the urgency of the problem, city council has taken a piecemeal approach to lowering speed limits. Councillors routinely support lowering limits in their own wards when residents request it. And in what was likely the city’s boldest move on the issue, the Toronto and East York Community Council last year voted to reduce the speed limit on all local roads within its jurisdiction to 30 km/h. But Albert Koehl, an environmental lawyer and road safety advocate, said the city’s unsystematic approach means that a community is only made safer if its residents are organized and their councillor is responsive. “It becomes an obvious equity issue,” he said. “Being safe shouldn’t be a question of what part of the city you live in.” The new $80-million   that council approved in July takes what city officials describe as a “targeted” approach to speed reductions, lowering limits only on certain streets deemed “high risk” based on collision data from the past decade. The plan will lower limits to 40 km/h from 50 km/h on about two dozen streets. But a Star analysis shows that of the 42 pedestrian deaths between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1 this year, just six took place on streets where the speed limits will be reduced as part of the plan. An additional six deaths occurred in areas slated for “safety audits,” which could result in reduced speeds. Public works chair Councillor Jaye Robinson, who spearheaded the plan, has said she’s “open-minded” about more widespread speed reductions, but defended the current “evidenced-based approach.”  “This is through a detailed analysis of the city’s collision data, and staff have identified these corridors as problem locations,” she said. According to Robinson, speeds have already been lowered on 14 “pedestrian safety corridors” identified in the plan, and the city is making other alterations such as better pedestrian markings and physical overhauls at these locations. The public health case for lowering speed limits is well established. Landmark British research conducted in the 1970s determined that pedestrians have an 85-per-cent chance of dying when hit by a vehicle travelling at about 65 km/h, a 45-per-cent chance at about 50 km/h, and only a 5-per-cent chance at about 30 km/h. The correlation holds true on Toronto’s streets. According to   report on pedestrian and cyclist safety, 57 per cent of fatal pedestrian collisions in the city occurred on roads with a posted speed limit of 60 km/h, while only 9 per cent took place on roads with limits of 40 km/h. Monica Campbell, director of healthy public policy at Toronto Public Health, explained that lower speeds don’t just reduce the force of impact in collisions, they make it easier for drivers to avoid crashes in the first place. “If you’re travelling quickly, you have a very narrow range of vision,” she said. Travelling at slower speeds allows drivers to have a better view of what’s happening. That enables them to stop sooner and to spot hazards such as someone darting out from behind a parked car. “What we know is there will be fewer collisions, there will be fewer injuries. And when there are injuries they will be less severe,” Campbell said. The idea of lowering Toronto’s default limit has been proposed before. In 2012, Toronto’s medical officer of health recommended lowering speed limits to 30 km/h on residential streets and 40 km/h on all other roads unless otherwise posted. The recommendation wasn’t well-received. Then-mayor Rob Ford slammed the report and lashed out at the officer of health, calling his six-figure salary “an embarrassment.” But with growing concern about pedestrian deaths, there are signs the political climate is changing. Stephen Holyday, an Etobicoke councillor seen by many as staunchly pro-car, doesn’t dismiss the idea of lower default speeds out of hand. “I think having a discussion about 40 km/h is a productive discussion,” he said. But he voiced concerns, shared by many road safety advocates and city transportation staff, that lower limits don’t work unless accompanied by design changes and stringent enforcement. Those measures can be expensive. “If you change the tin sign that’s hanging up, it doesn’t mean the driver is necessarily going to suddenly slow down,” Holyday said. In July, council asked staff to look into the implications of requesting the province to lower default limits. That discussion could soon be given additional impetus by proposed legislative changes the province is floating. City politicians don’t currently have the ability to lower default speed limits on their own because the default of 50 km/h for municipalities is set out in the provincial Highway Traffic Act. But in early  , Premier Kathleen Wynne proposed new legislation that would give cities the power to set their own default speeds within “community safety zones.” The potential implications of the law weren’t widely recognized at the time, but a spokesperson for the minister of transportation told the Star that because the law doesn’t define the size of the safety zone, if it were passed it would effectively grant municipalities the power to lower the default limit anywhere within their borders. “If a council wants it to be the entire municipality, it can do that,” wrote Stephen Heckbert in an email. A spokesperson for Mayor John Tory said he would need more information before he would consider a blanket reduction. Keerthana Kamalavasan noted that city staff are expected to report back to council in early 2017 on the road safety plan. “The mayor is committed to making sure all those who use our roads — pedestrians, cyclists and drivers — can get where they need to go as efficiently and safely as possible,” Kamalavasan said.  David Stark will never know if lower speed limits might have prevented his wife’s death. Since she died, Stark has become an advocate for safer roads and co-founded the Friends and Families for Safe Streets group. He supports lowering the default speed limit to 40 km/h, along with better street design, tougher distracted driving laws and stricter penalties for drivers who injure or kill. He knows that slowing down cars might not be popular, but he has a message for any skeptics. “There’s still a mindset out there among certain drivers that the car is king and roads should be designed to make it as efficient as possible for drivers to get to where they need to go,” he said. But “when you’re talking about the lives of people and their families . . . the message should be just slow down, take your time and let’s all arrive at our destinations safely.” ",0,Most pedestrian deaths occurring outside Toronto’s road safety plan: Analysis
"It was a cloudy Wednesday evening with a light rainfall when a 69-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man were struck by separate cars travelling in opposite directions shortly before 8 p.m. at an intersection in Little Italy. The woman suffered life-threatening injuries and died the next day, while the man was also taken to hospital. The two were among 14 pedestrians hit by vehicles between 6 p.m. on Nov. 2 and 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 3. That 14.5-hour window was one of the major spikes of some 70 collisions   during the month of November, according to data compiled by the Star. It had been 14 degrees the evening of the dual collision on Nov. 2. Overnight soggy conditions were likely a factor in  , police said. A   bled into the month to follow when three 13-year-olds who were trick-or-treating in North York were injured in a three-vehicle collision. Two twins were taken to Sick Kids Hospital in life-threatening condition while a third child suffered minor injuries after the crash around 8:30 p.m. Kyle Miller, an urban planner in Toronto, has tracked pedestrian and cyclist-involved collisions since June based on tweets by Toronto Police. Miller said nine children were struck by vehicles throughout November, more than any month since he began tracking in June. • Seven pedestrians were involved in six crashes on Nov. 4, leaving one person in life-threatening condition and another two in serious condition. • On Nov. 6, the day the clocks turned back, six pedestrians and a cyclist were struck, including a senior woman who died after being hit by a car in Etobicoke. • There were three collisions the next day that resulted in two serious injuries to a cyclist and pedestrian, respectively. Two of the incidents happened between 5:40-6 p.m. after the sun had set. • Five incidents on Nov. 9 left two cyclists and four pedestrians injured, including a mother and her child in a stroller who were in non-life threatening condition after being hit by a vehicle in Scarborough just after 8 p.m. • The next day, a 63-year-old woman was killed after being hit by a van in Scarborough, in a crash just after 5:30 p.m. that also left a 74-year-old man with life-threatening injuries after being trapped by the vehicle. There were three other notable collisions on Nov. 10, including one that left a cyclist with serious injuries. • Three pedestrians and a cyclist were hit by vehicles on Nov. 18, including a man in his 70s who sustained life-threatening injuries in Etobicoke around 1:30 p.m. • Five pedestrians were struck Nov. 20, including a woman and her child who were in serious but non-life threatening condition after being hit in Yorkville on a day of scattered showers and light snowfall. • On a cloudy day two days later, six pedestrians were involved in collisions, all of whom suffered minor injuries. Pedestrians are typically involved in more collisions in November than any other month, according to Toronto police, who say Daylight Savings Time is one of the reasons behind this. “Quite often the moderate to heavy rainfall type storms with heavy cloud cover is a contributing factor during the early morning or early evening hours,” said Toronto police Const. Clint Stibbe. “The weekend of the time change has been shown across many different jurisdictions to be a particularly bad one for car collisions,” said Miller. “It’s like people get discombobulated or something.” That weekend, Toronto Police launched its annual “STEP UP and Be Safe” Pedestrian campaign, which ran Nov. 7-13. “All police officers and parking enforcement officers will be paying particular attention to those motorists, cyclists and pedestrians who commit offences in the vicinity of pedestrian crossovers, crosswalks, intersections, school zones (particularly primary schools) and crossing areas frequented by seniors,” it said. “Pedestrians are encouraged to avoid using distracting electronic devices when interacting with vehicular traffic.” Matti Siemiatycki, an associate professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto, said the weather conditions of November, unlike the months that follow, aren’t typically extreme enough to keep people from going outside. “It’s darker and so there’s less visibility. The weather’s not so cold that pedestrian activity has declined, so there’s still a lot of people on the roads walking, but it’s darker,” he said. “Those two combined lead to potential for more accidents.” Stibbe said collisions are more likely to happen in the morning and evening, known as high pedestrian volume times, which at this time of year extend later. He said many accidents happen between about 7-9 a.m. and 3:30-7:30 p.m. Fridays tend to have the most accidents, and Sundays the fewest. On the four Fridays in November, 15 pedestrians and cyclists were hit by vehicles. “It’s well established that November and early December are especially dangerous for pedestrians,” said Dylan Reid, a pedestrian safety advocate and co-founder of Walk Toronto. “Rush hour is darker, basically, so there’s more people out and about when things are darker. Drivers haven’t adjusted, they’re still driving as if it’s light but it’s dark.” Reid said the police’s annual campaign, particularly its focus on distracted pedestrians, is ineffective. “What pedestrians are wearing is not a factor. The colour of pedestrian clothing, there’s no evidence that makes any difference,” he said. “Pedestrians could be wearing bright-coloured clothing or dark-coloured clothing, they’re not more or less visible to drivers. Most of the pedestrians hit during this time are obeying the laws.” A June 2015 Toronto Public Health report found that pedestrians had the right of way in 67 per cent of collisions they were involved in, from 2008-2012. Pedestrians did not have the right of way in only 19 per cent of those incidents, while it’s unclear who was at fault in the remaining 14 per cent. “What we really need is a focus on drivers to say, you need to be paying more attention because you’re not going to be able to be seeing as well. That needs to be the primary message,” said Reid. “I’m a little skeptical of these typical excuses about rain, about darkness because cities like Stockholm are some of the safest cities in the world for pedestrians and the sun sets at 2 p.m. in December. There’s more to it than just darkness and rain,” added Miller. Miller said he studied fatality rates across 100 different cities, but found no correlation to the amount of precipitation in each location. “That to me indicates that there’s something else going on,” he said, pointing to Toronto’s transportation infrastructure. “We’ve designed a transportation system based mostly on the car, especially the more suburban parts of the city. It’s very unforgiving to mistakes,” said Miller. “Increased stopping distance due to darkness or rain, slippery roads will put everyone at risk but people in cars are much better protected. Pedestrians bear an increased brunt of the risk.” ",0,"A dangerous month on the roads led to 70 collisions with pedestrians, cyclists"
