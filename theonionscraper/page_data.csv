"WASHINGTON—Saying his latest executive order was legal due to an “underutilized but totally feasible workaround,” President Trump claimed Tuesday that he could overrule the U.S. Constitution by means of the relatively obscure “no one will stop me” loophole. “My critics say a constitutional amendment or at least an act of Congress is necessary to end birthright citizenship, but what they don’t realize is that a seldom-evoked administrative guideline ensures I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, because zero people will stand in my way,” said Trump, adding that the largely unheard-of clause allows him to circumvent normal legal proceedings because it’s not like anyone in any branch of government remains effective enough to prevent him from doing so. “Though few modern presidents have made use of it, this loophole has always given the nation’s chief executive unilateral power over the Constitution. Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.

"WASHINGTON—Confirming the administration had launched a Justice Department investigation into the U.S. secretary of the interior’s conduct, the White House revealed Friday that it was concerned Ryan Zinke had made a land deal without giving a cut to President Trump. “Mounting evidence indicates that Secretary Zinke may have acted improperly by making money off of a private land development deal without letting President Trump wet his beak,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, confirming that Zinke’s role in the development of a business and retail park near land in Montana that he and his wife own may have run afoul of White House rules for skimming some profits off the top for the president. “At no time did Mr. Zinke inform us about which Trump Organization bank account he would be depositing the president’s kickback into, nor have we received an envelope full of unmarked bills slipped under the Oval Office door. We are extremely disappointed that the secretary would use his office to enrich himself without also enriching the president.” White House officials added that while they were committed to investigating Zinke for potential impropriety, they wanted to reassure Americans that the vast majority of federal employees always followed protocol in giving a cut of the profits from their private-sector hustles to the president.

"CENTENNIAL, CO—Noting that he typically advises anyone under 120 over 80 to go apeshit, local internist Dr. Alan Thal told patient Matt Richards Friday that his blood pressure read fairly normal, so he should really fucking let it rip. “Well, Mr. Richards, you’re at 118 over 74. That means do whatever the hell you want. Get wasted, start a smoking habit—who gives a shit, just fucking go nuts,” said Thal, adding that he’d like to keep an eye on it, but in the meantime, Richards is going to want to eat as much delicious, salty food as he wants and cut loose. “Blood pressure is measured in terms of systolic and diastolic numbers and, since both of yours are fine, you can stop wasting time exercising and do some real crazy shit. Keep in mind, you’re 51 and not getting any younger, so I strongly suggest going balls-to-the-wall sooner than later.” At press time, Richards had died as a result of hypertension 20 minutes after leaving the doctor’s office.

"HASTINGS, NE—Saying it was definitely not a situation to get worked up about, the nation’s wealthiest residents assured the rest of the American public Friday that the heavily armed city being built in the sky high above the central United States had nothing to do with anything and could just be ignored. According to the richest 0.1 percent of Americans, the massive floating city, which now casts a shadow from Nebraska to Minnesota, is lined across its entire perimeter with visible gun turrets, can house 300,000 people in luxurious accommodations, and uses giant tubes to siphon up fresh water from the Great Lakes, was not anything anyone needed to be concerned about. “The best thing you can do is to go about your day as usual and never give it a second thought,” Gina Betts, a spokesperson for the wealthy Americans, said of the resources currently being poured into the construction of a permanent and easily defended settlement hovering two miles above the Midwest. “There’s no reason for people to waste their time looking for any deep significance in the hourly departures of cargo planes carrying shipments of medicine, fuel, and munitions to a hulking fortress city in the clouds. Honestly, there’s no need to even bother looking up.” “Relax, it’s fine, it’s nothing,” Betts added as the rising towers of the city blocked out the sun across much of the country. The wealthiest Americans stated that it was not necessary to look into reports indicating they had devised a plan to extract all of the country’s arable topsoil so they could continue to grow food for their floating city in the wake of catastrophic climate change, saying any such efforts on their part were a coincidence and insignificant. They also told reporters that the public needn’t trouble itself with the fact that the rich have procured the nation’s entire supply of uranium-235 and hired the world’s top physicists to build a series of nuclear power plants and ensure all radioactive waste is funneled away from their new home and deposited onto the planet’s surface. Betts also explained there was “nothing unusual at all” about what appears to be a 100-foot-wide sewer drain extending downward from the floating metropolis and emptying above Sioux Falls, SD. “You know, rich people can be a bit eccentric, and sometimes we like to go out and buy up as many solar panels, oxygen tanks, and hazmat suits as we can just to say we did it,” said Betts, who noted that investing in a state-of-the-art antiballistic missile system that could defend against projectiles aimed at the city was simply “a pleasant little diversion” for the wealthy and should require no further explanation. “We have a lot of disposable income, and it can be fun spending some of that money to erect towering silos in the sky capable of holding the state of Iowa’s entire annual grain yield. It may be kind of quirky, but it certainly doesn’t have any far-reaching implications or anything like that.” “Frankly, we’d be offended if you thought there was something else going on here,” Betts continued. Representatives for the nation’s wealthy dismissed reports from across the country that mansions and penthouses were being abandoned en masse, suggesting that the richest Americans were probably all just going on vacation and that even if they were planning something, it was no big deal and not worth paying attention to. “This is our money, we earned it, and if, on nothing more than a pure whim, we want to assemble elite groups of private military contractors and deploy them to protect our sky city, we’ll do it, okay?” billionaire hedge fund manager Stephen Bennett said as he stood on a Minneapolis street corner and looked up, shouting to be heard above the deafening roar of thrusters that keep the settlement aloft. “If everyone else had worked harder, maybe they too could have outfitted an opulent paradise in the heavens replete with a pristine sustainable ecosystem, life-extending cryogenic technology, and tactical nuclear weapons aimed at any survivors below.” Bennett added, “But they didn’t, and now they have to suffer the consequences, which don’t amount to much, actually, because there’s nothing to worry about here—nothing at all.” ",1,Wealthy Americans Assure Populace That Heavily Armed Floating City Being Built Above Nation Has Nothing To Do With Anything
"BURRILLVILLE, RI—Touting it as an incredible opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a lucrative business endeavor, child venture capitalist Aidan Frost reportedly invested $2.50 Thursday in his friend’s new slug-eating enterprise. “I’m pleased to announce that I’ve agreed to make a more than two-dollar investment in Brian [Keller]’s innovative and promising plan to consume an entire huge, gross slug at recess,” said the 8-year-old angel investor, adding that he also planned to provide Keller with business advice related to the timing and marketing of the slug-eating launch, as well as put him in touch with his network of other jungle gym–based financiers in an effort to secure additional seed funding. “Slug-eating is poised to disrupt the playground, and while it’s definitely a lot of money up front, it’ll more than pay for itself with the amount of attention we should receive, especially if Brian pukes. It’s my hope that we can use Brian’s passion for eating gross stuff to expand this venture into worms or even pennies, or maybe start up an incubator where other entrepreneurs from across Mrs. Horgan’s class can develop ideas for other nasty things to eat.” At press time, the frustrated child venture capitalist acknowledged his failed investment after an investigation into the venture by playground supervisor Mr. Cunningham, who took away the slug and sent them both inside for the rest of recess.

"WASHINGTON—Drawing the ire of critics who decried the spot as “misleading” and “racially charged,” a new campaign ad released Friday by President Trump claimed that illegal immigrants are currently murdering you with a knife. “Thousands of homicidal MS-13 members have already poured over the Southern border and are at this very moment stabbing you repeatedly in the torso and stomach with a butcher’s knife,” said the ad, which urged voters to use the remainder of their strength to crawl to their nearest polling location before they bled out. “Several arteries have already been punctured, but before these monsters end your suffering they’re dragging your loved ones into the basement to flay them alive in front of you. You’re presently struggling against your restraints, but there’s nothing you can do. Soon you will begin to black out from despair and pain.

"WINCHESTER, VA—Attributing her current apathy to being stuck in the wholesaler’s remote canned goods aisle, Costco employee Tanya Fairbanks quietly remarked Friday that “Once they put me on cheeses, I will finally be happy,” as she handed out free samples of Vienna sausage. “I used to think that if I could just get put on free sample duty all my problems would go away, but once I got sausages I realized that true success is running the cheese station,” said Fairbanks as she stood beside the mostly untouched tray of bite-sized pieces of Libby’s brand Vienna sausages, each set in an individual serving cup and skewered with a toothpick. “Aisle 26 right between housewares and dairy—that’s where the real action is. If I could just get my foot in there and work my way up to running the Hillshire Farm spread, I could finally relax and enjoy everything I’ve worked for. Having a line of smiling customers waiting for you to offer them a selection of aged goudas or extra sharp cheddars has got to feel like a million bucks.” At press time, a dejected Fairbanks confirmed that she was trying to make the best of her stagnating career by accepting a lateral promotion to passing out Nature Valley granola bars.

"MACCLENNY, FL—Calling its clearly laid out regulations “surprisingly refreshing,” conservative Floridian man Ernest Moyer told reporters Friday he enjoys living under Sharia Law much more than he thought he would. “I gotta admit, when I said ‘Those damn Arabs are gonna ruin democracy’ I didn’t expect strictly abiding by the words of Muhammed would be so amazing for me,” said the 63-year-old follower of Islam, who, despite once fearing “the rule of that Muslim Obama and his Saudi P.C. militia,” now enjoys submitting his will to the Almighty during daily prayer, almsgiving, and his countless other fiqh rituals. “Sure, I miss drinking beer, but overall—thank Allah—I’m loving it. Praying towards Mecca is great, and eating Halal is pretty awesome if you know how to really prepare it. Plus, there’s these great retributive penal orders like stoning, beheading, and amputating—and I’m not just saying that because apostasy is punishable by death.” Moyer added that in a lot of ways, such as the law’s hostility towards women, gays, and criminals, things have barely even changed.

"ATHENS, GA—Saying that the data heralded a promising outcome for election day, representatives from Brian Kemp’s gubernatorial campaign were reportedly energized Thursday after perusing early voter suppression numbers. “It’s very exciting to see that with five days to go before the election, thousands of Georgians have already unsuccessfully attempted to cast their ballots,” said communications director Ryan Mahoney, noting that while these figures were not entirely predictive, they indicated a strong likelihood that the number of minority voters turned away at polling places would be extremely high on Nov. 6. “We still have our work cut out for us, obviously, but the more people who are prevented from casting mail-in or provisional ballots ahead of time, the more resources we can expend towards keeping down the vote next week. So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven’t been reached since the 1950s.” Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday.

"EDISON, NJ—Immediately after dedicating 20 pages to the end of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, 11th-grade social studies textbook   awkwardly crammed the last 40 years of history into a little blurb titled “Into Our New Millennium.” “They spent a whole chapter on Teddy Roosevelt alone, but now they’re racing through the 1970s and just kind of stuffing Nixon’s resignation, the energy crisis, and the Iranian hostage situation into bullet points,” said student Russell Keener of the single-page spread, which somehow managed to encompass the attempted assassination of President Reagan, Rubik’s cubes, the Tiananmen Square protests, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. “It felt like we spent forever on the cotton gin, but now we’re just blazing through several decades like they’re nothing. One moment it’s the Lewinsky scandal, and the next we’ve got the first black president? It’s especially jarring when the last page has two thumbnail pictures, one of the Twin Towers falling and the other of a computer with a caption saying ‘The advent of the internet forever changed the way we see the world.’ Huh?” At press time, students reported not being certain how to take the book’s concluding sentence, which asked the question, “And who knows what will happen next?” ",1,High School History Textbook Concludes With Little Blurb About Last 40 Years

Do I have the kind of face that says ‘Tell me what your issue with payroll is?’ Some of their problems sound really serious, and they should go to someone who can help them, not me.” At press time, Kent was unavailable to answer any further questions due to a new “Do Not Disturb” sign placed prominently on her office door.

"VATICAN CITY—Standing before his costumed congregants in St. Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis declared, “Take this grape for it is the witch’s eye, take this spaghetti for it is the witch’s brain,” during a Halloween-themed Communion Wednesday, Vatican sources confirmed. Holy See officials told reporters that the Bishop of Rome delivered his sermon bedecked in black-and-orange vestments as parishioners stood in line to be blindfolded and place their right hands in bowls of peeled grapes and cooked noodles during the Vatican’s traditional Monster Mass. “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spooky Ghost,” said the Pontiff, while altar boys dressed as specters held aloft thuribles full of dry ice and lit the votive jack-o-lanterns throughout the church. “Our Father, who art in Heaven, Halloween thy name; Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.” “Bwahahahamen,” the pope added. In an effort to cater to the estimated 30,000 Catholics from around the world who made the pilgrimage to Rome this year, St. Peter’s Square has reportedly been outfitted as a haunted hay maze to accommodate spillover attendees, with clergy dressed as mummies and werewolves hiding behind the colonnades in order to jump out at unsuspecting worshippers. Those who were able to secure tickets for the main service reportedly crowded into the basilica to bob for apples in the baptismal font, hear readings from the Book of Hexodus, and receive the sacrament of Unholy Boocharist. Vatican sources confirmed that after His Holiness Pope Francis delivered the introductory frights, he welcomed the visiting Bishop of Transylvania, who led the congregation in the  while church officials passed around plastic pumpkins to collect tithes. The ceremony reportedly continued with those assembled singing the traditional hymn “Dear Lord and Father of Wolfmankind” before the pontiff delivered a short homily centered on the miracle of the resurrection of Frankenstein’s monster. “As usual, Pope Francis’s mass was petrifyingly pious and spine-tinglingly soul-saving,” said parishioner Renee Dunbar of Salem, MA, clutching a rosary featuring a miniature scarecrow nailed to a cross. “I feel blessed that I was also able to secure tickets to the adults-only midnight service, which is supposed to be even creepier than tonight’s family-friendly version.” “Francis has shown once again that he’s willing to be a reformer and lead the Church into the future,” she added. “His communion was way better than the gore-and-dismemberment-centered torture sacrament that Pope Benedict would get into every year.” ",1,"‘Take This Grape For It Is The Witch’s Eye, Take This Spaghetti For It Is The Witch’s Brain,’ Says Pope Francis During Halloween-Themed Communion"
"SEATTLE—After a search for a new location lasting more than a year, a massive dome was seen descending from the sky and enclosing the whole nation Friday as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced to a horrified American populace that it was now living inside his company’s second headquarters. The impenetrable steel dome, which reportedly stretches from coast to coast and from the Mexican to the Canadian border, will house a state-of-the-art campus that serves as the online retailer’s long-awaited new base of operations. Amazon executives said that while they were impressed with the many proposals they received from cities across the country, they ultimately decided the location best suited to their ever-growing needs was the entirety of the continental United States. “We’re proud to welcome all 325 million new employees to the Amazon team,” said Bezos, his deafening voice causing Americans to clutch their ears in agony as the sun was suddenly blocked out and the image of his smiling face was projected onto the dome’s surface by the millions of Alexa-enabled devices in homes nationwide. “We believe we have finally found the best way to provide our customers with the lowest possible prices and the utmost convenience.” “Now, please, begin working—all of you,” Bezos added as a dark cloud of buzzing drones appeared on the horizon, depositing uniforms, orientation packets, and a pile of boxes to sort on the doorstep of every American home. Witnesses confirmed that as Bezos spoke, the national scene turned to chaos, with driverless bulldozers knocking down houses and screaming citizens running through the streets as they attempted to dodge giant pallets of consumer goods being airdropped from above. At least 23 flights entering or exiting U.S. airspace at the time of the dome’s descent were reported to have slammed into the structure and exploded, while thousands of people on the nation’s beaches and in its border towns are believed to have been crushed as the 40-foot-thick edges of the structure crashed down upon them. In eastern Kentucky, a forklift was seen loading cages full of people into a shipping container, reportedly so they could be relocated to new workplaces in different parts of the country, where they will clock 18-hour daily shifts with no bathroom breaks. According to sources, a large swath of the Midwest will soon be razed to make way for a single enormous Amazon Fulfillment Center, while the entire state of Texas will be replaced with a 269,000-square-mile facility used exclusively to house cardboard boxes, tape, and inflatable packaging materials. Sources also told reporters that societal order will be maintained by Amazon’s approximately 100,000 warehouse robots, which have been modified to perform new tasks such as consolidating the nation’s food supply into the company’s AmazonFresh service and distributing 1,000-calorie daily rations to each citizen-employee. Though every man, woman, and child is now required to work, and every school in the country has been demolished, the educational resource program AmazonInspire is expected to offer learning opportunities at the detention camps it is now tasked with operating. “We’re confident our employees will enjoy working for the rest of their lives on this scenic campus, where they can take in sights like Glacier National Park, make use of the recreational opportunities provided by the Appalachian Trail, or be drafted into our new standing army,” said Bezos, his voice continuing to reverberate through the giant dome. “For the sake of convenience, your Prime membership fees will be automatically deducted each pay period, and all wages will be paid in the form of Amazon gift cards. What’s more, every employee in good standing will receive one free Audible download per month!” At press time, as Bezos was hinting that Amazon might begin construction on a third headquarters, an immense titanium shell was seen enclosing the planet Earth.

"EAGLE BEACH, ARUBA—As part of Barack Obama’s exclusive deal to produce original content for the streaming service, Netflix announced Friday that production has finished on  , a reality series in which 24 young women vie for the heart of the former president. Netflix confirmed two dozen women were flown in from all over the United States to a replica White House mansion in the scenic island getaway of Aruba, where, over the course of eight episodes, they competed in daily presidential challenges such as attending state visits with foreign dignitaries, selecting judicial nominees, planning a romantic date night in a mock-up of Obama’s Hyde Park neighborhood, and developing a coherent Syria policy. “Viewers will be thrilled to watch Mr. Obama as he navigates a sea of love to find the one special woman he wants to share his post-presidency with,” said Netflix executive Cindy Holland, noting that the series would premiere with the tagline “Love has no term limit.” “There will be tears and heartbreak, but when this wild ride is over, one of these lucky ‘first ladies’ will land the president she’s always dreamed of.” “At the end of the day, finding that special someone is a challenge for everyone, even the former leader of the free world,” Holland added. Filming is said to have begun in February, with Obama greeting his prospective love interests as they exited a Hummer limousine onto the North Lawn of the recreated White House. One by one, the contestants—including former Miss Teen USA Danika Owens, 22; office temp Ambre Newlon, 21; and Tucson-based cocktail waitress Kassidy Vance, 25—reportedly hugged the president and gave a short introduction, some choosing to recite a favorite passage from   and all hoping to become one of the final eight contestants selected to join Obama’s Cabinet. Publicity clips revealed that after the young women settled into their luxurious new digs, they spent a day preparing to serve as Obama’s press secretary, with each getting a chance to conduct a daily briefing for reporters and the winner receiving a bouquet of flowers picked from the Rose Garden by the onetime commander in chief. In a promotional screener for the first episode, drama struck right away, with several of the women complaining they weren’t able to spend quality time with Obama because 23-year-old event planner Mindy Bell has hogged him all night by making out with him in the Oval Office jacuzzi. However, by the end of the series premiere, Bell was forced to leave the White House after failing to receive an American flag lapel pin symbolizing Obama’s love. “Barack and I just, like, have so much in common between our love of basketball and helping people,” yoga instructor Kayleigh Sutherland, 21, said in one of the clips after winning a challenge in which each woman has to serve as a senior adviser to the former president, briefing him on the best strategy for winning her heart. “Some of the other girls have criticized me, saying I didn’t even vote for him. But what they don’t realize is that I’m very politics minded [sic] and would have voted for him in a heartbeat if I had turned 18 in time.” “I still can’t believe he has daughters my age,” Sutherland added. Producers stated that as the show progresses, several frontrunners begin to emerge, with Obama taking a liking to Alexis Nash, 23, after they bond during a group date to promote job-training initiatives for low-income Chicago youths. According to sources, conservative Trump supporter Tami Lynn Gibbs, 21, also becomes a favorite following a one-on-one date during which she and the president visit his hometown of Honolulu and fly Predator drones together on the beach during sunset. Netflix executives said the series builds to a climax as the contestants become increasingly competitive about who gets to join Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom once he has dismissed the Secret Service for the night. They described how the president’s resolve was put to the test when he must hold diplomatic talks in the Situation Room after several of the contestants insulted 24-year-old acupuncturist Ree Ree Clark, calling her a “skank” and a “gold-digging hoe in chief.” Following lengthy negotiations, Obama reportedly managed to secure a resolution in which all parties agreed the use of such epithets was not conducive to long-term mutual prosperity. “These are some really wonderful women, and if I could choose all of them, I would,” the 44th president said in one scene as he stares pensively out over the Truman Balcony in a tan tuxedo, awaiting the ceremony in which he will finally reveal the name of the woman he wants to be with. “Unfortunately, I can’t, so I’ll just have to follow my heart. In the end, it’s the heart that matters. This may be the most difficult situation I’ve ever faced.” “After all, this is love we’re talking about,” the Nobel Peace Prize laureate adds. At press time, sources confirmed Obama had nearly proposed to   champion Alexis Nash, but after a last-minute change of heart, he instead chose to elope with the show’s runner-up, Ann Coulter.

"SPRINGVILLE, UT—Concerned by the disturbing changes in her behavior since she discovered the site earlier this year, local man Derek Wilkinson told reporters Friday he worries his girlfriend, Katie Spencer, has started to become radicalized by a skin-care blog. Wilkinson explained that Spencer’s involvement with the DermaTru website began innocently enough, with the 23-year-old woman occasionally browsing it for moisturizer recommendations or advice on how to treat a blemish. But he soon noticed his girlfriend engaging in uncharacteristic behaviors that suggested she had been indoctrinated by the blog and fallen victim to the dogmatic teachings of its instructional videos. Before long, Wilkinson confirmed, she was speaking continually of “the one true beauty regimen.” “She started performing these rituals of cleansing, toning, and lotioning five times a day, and it really weirded me out,” said Wilkinson, who added that Spencer spends several hours each night either on the blog’s message boards sharing testimonials with other followers or in front of her mirror obeying strict edicts regarding the extraction of blackheads. “Something changed in her when she first began visiting that site, and at this point she’s totally obsessed.” “The other day she looked me in the eye and told me she had finally found the path that will deliver us from dryness,” Wilkinson continued. “I had no idea what she was talking about. It’s like I don’t even know who she is anymore.” Spencer has reportedly become more withdrawn since embracing the tenets of DermaTru, distancing herself from family and friends who don’t share her intense devotion and, in her mind, are among the “unexfoliated heretics” of the world. According to Wilkinson, Spencer’s entire life revolves around the blog’s five pillars of skin care: hydration, rejuvenation, UV protection, elasticity, and essence. “Sometimes, she spends the whole day doing this ceremonial bathing rite that she told me is the only way to fully cleanse oneself of impurities,” said Wilkinson, noting that his girlfriend covers her face in a skin-brightening clay mask for several hours before applying no fewer than 10 fortifying serums and anti-aging creams, which must be made from ingredients processed in the name of DermaTru. “She’ll be methodically reciting a long list of revitalizing formulas or whatever, and I won’t know what to say to her. She’s just not the girl she used to be. And the worst part is she’s now pushing her crazy skin-care stuff on me, saying I must denounce all false ablutions.” “Look, I’ll be the first to admit I could stand to use something on my face besides aftershave, but applying non-nano zinc oxide SPF 50 every 20 minutes throughout the day to ward off wrinkles?” Wilkinson added. “That’s completely insane. And there’s all these people on the internet telling Katie it’s the best thing she could be doing for herself.” Recent studies have found that extremist skin-care organizations often use digital media to prey upon young women who may feel hopeless, recruiting them with radical lifestyle products that seem to provide answers to all their problems. “These small blogs offer this marginalized subset an identity and a community, along with free samples and the promise of clearer, more supple skin,” said Margaret Novak, a psychologist at Stanford University who specializes in deprogramming people brainwashed by similar beauty sleeper cells. “These women have rejected big brands like Neutrogena and Clinique as the way to smaller pores, but what they end up with instead is something altogether more nefarious.” Novak warned that once they are radicalized, these young pore purists will often attend a secret meet-up sponsored by DermaTru and never return home, showing up months later in one of the group’s detoxifying-facial-scrub training videos. At press time, Wilkinson told reporters he was on the verge of contacting authorities after discovering his girlfriend had assembled a homemade bath bomb using instructions she found on the blog.

"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to provide much-needed assistance to the beleaguered terrorist organization, a charity concert known as Rock The Caliphate—featuring U2, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, and other top musical acts—was held last night to raise money for the struggling Islamic State. According to event organizers, the star-studded benefit, held before a crowd of nearly 100,000 at the Los Angeles Coliseum and live-streamed over the internet to millions more, aimed to bring together the biggest names in pop music and fund relief efforts that will aid ISIS militants in their attempt to reestablish a caliphate and return to the territories they once called home. “We can no longer turn a blind eye toward the devastation faced by this group of radical Islamists,” said Bono, U2 frontman and one of the concert’s organizers, who appeared on stage in his trademark wraparound shades and with an ISIS flag draped over his shoulders. “In the past few years, nearly all the land of their great country has been stripped away from them, and they have seen tens of thousands of their brethren killed by bombs. They have been left with almost nothing. Tonight, we come together to say, ‘No more!’ Tonight, we come to offer help.” “All proceeds from this performance will go directly to underprivileged jihadis,” Bono continued, “because no child soldier deserves to go off and fight for a cause without food in his stomach and a Kalashnikov in his hands.” After his high-energy set opening the four-hour concert, performer Bruno Mars lent his star power to the Islamic State by working the phone banks, where he reportedly solicited donations from TV viewers alongside celebrities such as Jimmy Fallon, Jennifer Lawrence, self-proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and Chris Pratt. The pop sensation told callers their contributions would help ensure ISIS recruits receive the training they need to conduct public floggings, burn people alive, stone infidels to death, and throw adulterers off the roofs of tall buildings. “For these terrorists, the dream of a global caliphate completely cleansed of Christians, Jews, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims is dying,” said singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who told reporters he was persuaded to participate in the benefit show after learning many in the Islamic State don’t even have human shields to protect themselves with. “They have so much potential—they could be out there retaking Raqqa and Mosul—but they’ve been left destitute by airstrikes and Kurdish freedom fighters. We have to get out there and do something to empower these people, like giving them the tools they need to build explosive devices and carry out violent beheadings.” “If even one person hears me singing and the power of music moves them to reach into their hearts and pockets and give so that a young ISIS teen can strap on his first suicide vest, then I’ve done my part as an artist,” Sheeran added. For the show’s final encore, Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, and Cardi B joined U2 for a performance of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” that was accompanied by a video montage showing the ravaged remains of the caliphate as it shrinks from an area the size of Britain to a few tiny Syrian outposts. A new recording of the song has been made available in the iTunes store, with revenues reportedly going toward the purchase of computers that will allow budding ISIS cyber-warriors to fulfill their dreams of hacking into the servers of Western governments and, in time, destroying all of Christendom. As of press time, the track had already been downloaded more than 17 million times. Sources reported that al-Baghdadi was pleased with the sold-out benefit concert and deemed the event an overwhelming success after a series of charges placed throughout the stadium were simultaneously detonated, killing everyone in attendance.

"WASHINGTON—While using brightly colored magic markers to write articles in a makeshift bullpen deep beneath the White House, an ink-splattered Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. said Wednesday they had made it their mission to fight bias in the mainstream media by hand-printing their own newspaper. According to the brothers, the inaugural issue of their paper, called  , covers the most pressing issues of the day, with front-page stories such as “The Time Dad Saved The Country In Porko Reeco From A Hurricane” and “Dad Again Tops List Of 100 Best American Pretzeldents.” Though fingerprints and smudges rendered much of the text unreadable, the content inside the paper appeared to include obituaries of “dumb Democrats” the boys wished were dead and a comic strip depicting the misadventures of a character called Little Eric. “When we heard the stuff those mean news jerks were talking about, we knew we had to find a way to get a whole bunch of the actual truth out there,” said Eric Trump, who held up a copy of the issue to show how hard he had worked to decorate its construction-paper pages with stickers and glitter, continuing on with the project even after a misapplication of rubber cement resulted in his hand being stuck to a table for more than an hour. “Unlike those lying germalists [sic], when we make up the news, we don’t use any bias. We are doing lotsa good work.” “After all, President Dad is counting on us!” Eric added. Reports within the executive residence confirmed the Trump boys were going through two packs of candy cigarettes a day as they sat in an unused closet illuminated only by their Vtech Spin and Learn Color Flashlight, transcribing notes they had written on their hands during a “top-secret meeting” with Ben Carson. White House sources confirmed the brothers cornered the Housing and Urban Development secretary in the West Wing and peppered Carson with questions about how much bigger and louder America’s bombs were than North Korea’s. With the first issue’s publication fast approaching, sources said production had come to a screeching halt early Tuesday, when Don Jr. yelled, “Stop the presses!” after Eric hit him on the arm for saying the younger brother wasn’t old enough to be the newspaper’s editor. The boys then reportedly began wrestling as they argued over whether to lead the edition with the story about their dad being the number-one president of all time or an exclusive headlined “No Moore Choccccolate Milk In White Howse Cafurteria.” The tense editorial meeting reportedly came to an abrupt conclusion once Eric started crying after being placed into a headlock. Later, while touting   as “the only place to get the real story that probably happened,” Don Jr. and Eric were seen distributing the half dozen handmade copies they had finally produced to the first people they encountered in the halls of the White House, including a Secret Service agent, two West Wing interns, Melania Trump, and a butler who brought them a snack after they complained about running out of graham crackers. Deeming their project a success, the brothers were soon overheard planning the launch of a Trump Boys TV news channel, and after climbing inside a large cardboard box with a hole cut out of the front, they spent much of the afternoon interviewing their favorite action figures and asking them why people spread so many lies about their dad. “Now that we’re on the beat, there will finally be a paper that runs   news about Dad,” Don Jr. said while taking a break from penning a statement from the newspaper’s editorial board urging the president to let his sons stay up until 8:30 p.m. and eat ice cream. “It’s been super tough trying to get the story. Sometimes you have to camp out underneath the Resolute desk for a whole hour, and sometimes Eric has to keep going to the press briefings every day even though Sarah Sanders never calls on him. But no matter what, we always get the scoop.” “I bet we’ll get a Publisher’s Surprise [sic] for this,” he added. At press time, sources reported President Trump was throwing a wadded-up newspaper at the boys and telling them to get out of his office.

"ATLANTA—In an effort to introduce the subject in a fun and kid-friendly way, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday the launch of its new “Raw Dog the STI Pup” campaign, which warns young children about the dangers of unprotected sex. The campaign’s stated aim is to raise student awareness of sexually transmitted infections by distributing to the nation’s health educators thousands of colorful posters, stickers, and storybooks featuring Raw Dog, a mangy, lesion-ridden puppy who fails to use protection. The CDC said it believes kids between the ages of 8 and 12 will respond to the mischievous but lovable canine, who embarks upon misadventures with a colorful cast of animal friends named Hepatitis Bee, Clam Idia, and Sperm Whale. “With the nation’s STI rate at a record high, we realized we needed a fun-loving character like Raw Dog who could really show kids the importance of throwing on a glove before you fuck,” said CDC representative Martin Searle, who described how Raw Dog developing jaundiced yellow eyes and fungal blisters after failing to “wrap his wick” offered an entertaining and thought-provoking tale that children could easily grasp. “It’s amazing how quickly youngsters pick up on Raw Dog’s lessons when they see him complaining about frequent penile discharge or dragging his ass along the ground because gonorrhea makes him itchy.” “Plus, he’s so darn cute!” added Searle, cradling one of the many shedding, patchy-furred Raw Dog plush toys being sent to classrooms nationwide. Through storytelling, puppetry, and sing-alongs featuring Raw Dog’s pesky foes, Stinky and Pinky, CDC officials said they hope to drive home the benefits of proper prophylactic use to elementary school students. The agency also detailed plans to send costumed characters such as Gretchen the Genital Warthog to schools for in-class demonstrations of how “getting ridden hard without a rubber” can lead to a lifetime of genital herpes outbreaks. According to the CDC, the campaign will also provide educators with 45-minute animated videos depicting Raw Dog’s troubles, including  , a story in which the narrator scolds the incorrigible for puppy for not wearing a condom while “busting a nut,” and  , in which syphilis from bareback sex in an alley behind a dumpster causes him to develop painful, oozing pustules and start urinating blood. “We’re really exploring some pretty exciting ways to show young kids the importance of strapping that shit before intercourse,” said Searle, pointing to  , a CDC-designed tablet game in which players must swipe furiously to stop the puppy from dropping his bone into holes where it doesn’t belong. “We’re also working on some interactive skits where kids get to role-play calling up Raw Dog’s former partners after he tests positive for HIV.” “After all, it’s just like Raw Dog always tells kids: ‘Don’t be like me, or your genitals will get  !’” Searle continued. The campaign has been criticized by many Catholic and evangelical groups, who have demanded the CDC bring back its Reagan-era CelibaSea Lion character, who urged young girls to take chastity pledges and “never get wet” until marriage. Doubts have also been expressed by parents who normally support safe-sex education. “I’m glad they’re teaching this stuff, but some of the materials give me pause,” said Greg Jensen, 43, a parent of a fourth-grader at Lincoln Elementary in Sioux Falls, SD where a pilot version of the campaign was conducted last year. “It’s just a little awkward when my kid comes home with a big stack of pamphlets showing the Hepatitis Bee saying ‘Zzz, watch out where you sit!’ or Raw Dog biting at his crotch while a bunch of little crabs pinch his hindquarters.” He added, “Plus, at this age, I mostly just want my son to be learning about mouth and hand stuff.” ",1,CDC Introduces ‘Raw Dog’ The STI Pup To Educate Children About The Dangers Of Unprotected Sex

"CAPE ELIZABETH, ME—In what is being described as the most ruthless act of bovine–crustacean violence in years, local authorities confirmed Monday that a charging herd of cattle had trampled 49 lobsters to death on the southern coast of Maine, marking a bloody escalation in their surf ’n’ turf war. According to reports, the shoreline at Crescent Beach State Park was littered with crushed claws and carapaces, the deadliest hit yet in a week of intensifying conflict between lobsters and cows. The fragile 16-month truce between the rivals is said to have been shattered Sunday when a lone mother cow wandered into lobster territory at low tide and, after a tense exchange of shouted insults, lost her left front hoof in a pincer attack. “I heard this awful  ,  ,   sound of shells cracking under hooves and immediately called the cops,” said longtime Maine resident Anna Newman, who on Monday heard loud, taunting moos outside her beach house and witnessed the indiscriminate stampeding of lobsters as she crouched low and peered out from behind a curtain. “Bad blood between the cows and the shellfish goes back a long way, of course, but I’ve never seen it get this vicious before.” “Yesterday, a steer drove his horn straight through a soft-shell crab that was just minding his own business, and the day before that, a whole pod of angry lobsters pinched a cow’s udder off right in front of her calves,” she continued. “It’s a nightmare.” High-ranking bovine lieutenants are believed to have ordered Monday’s deadly trampling after the carcass of a young heifer from a prominent cow family washed up on the shore near Kettle Cove, her hide branded with a pair of crossed pincers and the phrase “sea life.” This insignia is known to be used by affiliates of the Atlantic Lobster and King Crab crews, who were themselves reportedly retaliating against the cows after an incident last week in which a ferocious bull gored to death an entire school of great northern prawns. With the killing Thursday of a dozen Wellfleet oysters in a disputed tide pool, reports confirmed the current surf ’n’ turf war has become the deadliest since the 1980s, when hostilities between lobsters and cows were so common that no creature could cross through a pasture or estuary without fear of being brutally fileted or shelled. Participants on both sides of the present conflict suggested the widespread killings would get worse before they got better. “We merely seek to defend ourselves against those who would scuttle onto our territory and steal the land right out from under our hooves,” said cow boss Gertie, who decried the crustacean’s atrocities, citing the alleged abduction of a Holstein steer who had a strip steak snipped out of his still-living body by a King Crab enforcer. “The only way we can succeed is for the Herefords and Longhorns to extend their dominion over the ocean and root out our enemies where they live. Every lobster must die—whether they are killed in battle or after a period of confinement in a crowded supermarket aquarium.” “The bays and inlets will run red with bisque,” she added. Independent sources confirmed lobster have subjected cows to an excruciating practice known as “brining,” in which captive bovines are forced to drink seawater until they die of dehydration. At the same time, reports have suggested cows indoctrinate their young into a violent lifestyle before they are even weaned, forcing calves to prove their mettle by stealing lobster traps and placing them in the sun, where, after baking in agony for a day or more, their occupants eventually suffocate. “For too long we have been relegated to second-class status alongside these disgusting slabs of fat and gristle—even our humble bivalve brethren know they are superior to cows,” said lobster patriarch Klktelek, who wears a string of cowbells around his neck, each one reportedly taken from a cow he has killed slowly, pinch by pinch. “Cows poison the planet with their shit and eat everything in their path. We will roast them on spits right there in their own meadows and fields, hanging their severed heads on every wall from ocean to prairie.” Klktelek added, “Soon it will only be surf, no turf.” ",1,Cows Trample Dozens Of Lobsters To Death In Escalating Surf ’N’ Turf War
"PHILADELPHIA—Saying you’d take to your new way of life almost immediately, a study published by sociologists at the University of Pennsylvania on Friday suggests that you would have absolutely no problems being a rich asshole. “Although you currently express considerable disdain for rich assholes, the data overwhelmingly indicate that you would gladly embrace being a wealthy douchebag who sips $50,000 champagne and cavorts around in a multimillion dollar yacht and that, should you ever have this opportunity, you would quickly grow to detest your prior life in all respects,” said lead researcher Francine St. Almont, noting that whatever your political leanings are now, as a well-to-do shithead, you would instantly favor any politician who promised to make you even richer. “Furthermore, we found that in almost no time at all, you would be associating exclusively with other rich assholes—eating what they ate, vacationing where they vacationed, and buying what they bought—and the thought of being in the presence of friends or even family members who very recently meant everything to you would be laughable.” The report also found that despite your distaste for superficial people, you would be more than happy to wake up one day as a complete dumbfuck who could coast through life on their good looks alone.

"WASHINGTON—In the aftermath of a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 people dead, President Donald Trump reportedly slammed the worldwide Jewish conspiracy Monday for not doing more to prevent the violent attack. “I condemn in the strongest possible terms the shadowy global cabal of Jewish people who, despite the fact that they control everything on Earth, weren’t even able to stop a single shooter,” said Trump in a press conference, adding that he didn’t understand why the worldwide Jewish conspiracy didn’t simply hypnotize the killer through the television or create a massive storm that would have stopped him from leaving his house. “This entire tragedy could have been avoided if the Jews had simply manipulated the global economy and the banks to ensure that the shooter didn’t have enough money to afford a gun or ammunition. It is an absolute shame that the worldwide Jewish plot failed to telepathically communicate the imminent danger to the people in the building, or use their minds to erect an invisible, impenetrable barrier around the entire synagogue.” Trump ended his speech by calling for unity in the worldwide Jewish conspiracy to prevent future anti-Semitic hate crimes with their mystical powers.

"ATLANTA—Saying there was “no escape, no escape at all” from the deadly pathogens, disheveled Centers for Disease Control director Robert R. Redfield warned the nation Thursday from inside a sterilized plastic bubble that “invisible germs are crawling absolutely everywhere.” Redfield, who sported a long, unkempt beard and wore a filthy suit as he held a press conference within a hermetically sealed office at the CDC headquarters, urged Americans to avoid all areas to which the virulent and highly contagious microbes are likely to have spread, including schools, offices, shopping centers, restaurants, places of worship, the entirety of the outdoors, and even one’s own home. “Initial findings indicate we are in the midst of a full-blown outbreak of imperceptible germs swarming over every conceivable surface, which is why I am calling on the federal government to declare a state of emergency,” said Redfield, pausing briefly in his prepared remarks as his gnarled, 6-inch-long fingernails seemed to cause him some difficulty with flipping to his next notecard. “Many of these microorganisms are airborne, so I encourage all citizens to quarantine themselves as soon as possible in a large protective sphere equipped with environmental controls and an air-filtration system, much like this one I have designed for myself and have lived in for the past nine months.” “Because these creeping, infectious bugs may also be waterborne, all Americans should refrain from bathing until further notice,” he added while scrubbing his hands raw with steel wool. “They’re all over the place. They’re everywhere you could possibly imagine.” Redfield, who vigorously scratched at his arm, continuing until he began to tear off bloody patches of skin, pointed to a wall lined floor to ceiling with glass bottles he had filled with his own urine so it could be analyzed for possible contagions. He also suggested that every man, woman, and child in the United States do the same thing. The CDC director, who apologized to reporters for not making eye contact as he spoke but said that’s how the germs get into your mind and start controlling your thoughts, interrupted the press conference at one point to accept a written briefing from an aide. Redfield instructed his subordinate to place the document in a ziplock bag, slide it under the door, knock three times, count to 15, and then walk away. He reportedly asked the aide to stop and restart the entire process several times before he was convinced the procedure had been completed correctly. “As a precautionary measure, I’ll be conducting the remainder of the press conference in a protective crouch, my body shielded by this lead-lined blanket,” said the muffled voice of the director, moments after determining the brief’s delivery had compromised the sterility of his bubble, a realization that caused him to shriek uncontrollably until a team of workers in hazmat suits could administer a sedative. “If the American people wish to stay safe, they must realize the importance of sequestering themselves from all human contact, especially interactions with trusted friends and loved ones, who appear to be the deadliest vectors of this incurable and untreatable pestilence.” “The germs are on you right now, billions and trillions of them, everywhere you look,” he continued. “They’re also inside you, where they can’t be reached. The best advice we can give you right now is to pull out all of your molars immediately.” Redfield announced the CDC has already earmarked $22.3 million toward fighting the epidemic, much of which will be spent on building sealed plastic chambers and destroying every flying insect, radio tower, and dirty spoon on U.S. soil. In addition, he has reportedly directed his agency to set up thousands of emergency sanitizing stations where individuals who have been exposed can douse their faces in bleach and attempt to burn the germs off their skin with a gas stove. Going forward, Redfield explained, the primary goals of the CDC would be to “eliminate all germs, protect the American people, eliminate all germs, and protect the American people.” “There are several ways to limit the spread of these tiny, horrid viruses, including wearing protective footwear made from sanitary materials such as tissue boxes,” he said, pointing to his own feet. “We must act quickly and decisively, or we face the very real possibility that our populace may never be fully clean again.” He added, “Never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again, never be fully clean again.” ",1,Disheveled CDC Director Warns Of ‘Invisible Germs Crawling Everywhere’ From Inside Sealed Plastic Bubble
"WASHINGTON—Demanding aides write down every single word from the morning’s  broadcast, President Trump turned on Fox News Tuesday and directed his staff to take everything its anchors were saying and make it into a law, White House sources confirmed. “Whatever they’re talking about right now, just draft it up and put it on my desk so I can sign it,” said Trump as he reportedly rewound the TiVo in the Oval Office dining room and replayed a sound bite from Steve Doocy that is expected to become the law of the land by the end of the week. “There’s a lot of really good material here—you’ve got the caravan, stuff about guns, ISIS—make sure you get it all down. You hear the places where they’re chuckling? Put that in there, too. I want everything.” At press time, sources said the president’s aides were handing him a final draft of an executive order that appeared to be a verbatim 60-page transcription of  , complete with the text of several ads for IHOP and Sandals Resorts.

Without the proper care, I could very soon deteriorate to the point where our country is left with no Ryan Zinke at all—and how will we explain   to our grandkids?” Zinke went on to say it would be a grave injustice if the closest future generations ever got to his spectacular grandeur were a mere archived photo from the Interior Department website.

"MILWAUKEE—Saying the newly unearthed materials would help shed light on the serial killer’s extensive oeuvre, the Jeffrey Dahmer estate held a press conference Friday during which it announced plans to exhibit victim remains never before seen by the general public. The trove of human remnants, which reportedly consists of two freezers full of assorted bones, skin, and viscera, is said to bear all the markings of the late cannibal’s signature style. According to museum officials, it will be on display at Milwaukee’s state-of-the-art Dahmer Center beginning in October. “Whether you’re a seasoned Dahmer aficionado or simply a casual fan of late 20th-century cannibalism, you’re sure to find something remarkable in this sizable addition to the master’s already considerable body of work,” said senior curator Alicia Dahmer-Goldstein, who noted that artifacts in the new collection date from early in Dahmer’s career but already display the inventiveness and unparalleled grasp of corpse-dismemberment techniques that would make him famous. “Fortunately, these remains were well-preserved and required only minimal restoration. In most cases, the flesh had barely even necrotized, which means viewers will be able to marvel at the original serrations and bite marks.” “There had long been rumors of Dahmer works that disappeared or were forgotten, but we never imagined we would recover anything more than a few severed toes or perhaps a jawbone—certainly nothing of this magnitude,” Dahmer-Goldstein continued, gesturing toward a bleached ribcage, a pair of mummified hands, and a half-eaten liver. “We’re confident that visitors will find this refurbished collection every bit as vibrant and captivating as they would have on the day these bodies were first desecrated.” Estate officials confirmed the 20,000-square foot Dahmer Center will exhibit the majority of the newfound objects in a recently renovated wing where they can be viewed alongside the famed necrophiliac’s other works. The items will be displayed in darkened, low-temperature rooms in order to prevent further deterioration, they said, and will be presented alongside quotes from police reports and large-screen projections of Dahmer’s iconic Polaroids, which show the cadavers in various stages of dissection. In addition, a few smaller pieces of intestine will reportedly be sent to the J.L. Dahmer Gallery at the murderer’s alma mater, Ohio State University. Though no admission will be charged for either exhibit, a suggested donation of $20 will be collected, with proceeds going to benefit Jeffrey’s Boys, a nonprofit that provides embalming fluid and taxidermy lessons to budding psychopaths in underserved areas. “The real jewel of the collection is, of course, the boiled skull with dozens of inch-deep perforations above the eye sockets,” Dahmer-Goldstein said. “Lesser works, such as the partially dissolved pelvis, show the care and devotion that Dahmer brought to even his most minor victims. His method of softening but not destroying the bone would have taken hours, yet it was all part of his diligent, exacting process. Though he had already begun experimenting with the idea of creating a living sex zombie who would obey his every whim, his lack of overall thematic focus at this stage shows a nascent butcher still struggling to come into his own.” “Of course, there are already numerous examples of his recurrent motif of amputating male genitalia and placing them in jars, which is classic Dahmer,” she added. After a nine-month stay in Milwaukee, the exhibit will reportedly tour Illinois as part of a preexisting agreement with Chicago’s Gacy Foundation. Anticipation is already high for the new works, with the Dahmer Center receiving positive feedback from the handful of lucky visitors who were allowed to attend this week’s soft opening of the exhibit prior to October’s official unveiling. “There have been countless serial killers over the years, but there’s only one Dahmer,” said visitor Gregory Funt, 26, showing reporters several dozen pages of unusually detailed sketches and notes he made during his time inside the gallery. “He’s always been a guiding light to kids like me growing up in the Midwest. He showed us you don’t have to live in New York or L.A. Wherever you’re from, if you have talent and tenacity, you can make your mark in history.” “This whole trip has been so inspiring,” Funt added. “I can’t wait to try out some of Dahmer’s techniques and styles in my next big project.” ",1,Jeffrey Dahmer Estate Releases Collection Of Never-Before-Seen Victim Remains
"WASHINGTON—Declaring the rapid decrease in the population of several endangered species “problematic,” Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke called for new legislation Thursday designed to slow the destruction of the nation’s wildlife so that he might relish every last minute of its extinction. “We need to preserve these magnificent animals so that I can watch them suffer one by one,” said Zinke, adding that the more species were preserved, the more opportunities he would have to look on as they starved, choked on garbage, or became caught in bear traps. “Animals, plants, and insects are currently dying out at the rate of 200 per day, and it’s just not humanly possible to savor the death throes of the last of something’s kind if they’re all happening at once. We need to pump the brakes and make an effort to preserve, oh, let’s say, the last thousand Hawaiian harbor seals so that someday my grandchildren can experience the wonder of watching as the life drains from their adorable little eyes.” Zinke concluded by introducing a fundraising measure designed to draw out the suffering of the nation’s most iconic endangered bird by selling T-shirts and bumper stickers emblazoned with the legend “SAVE THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR FOR LAST.” ",1,Ryan Zinke Calls For Legislation To Slow Down Destruction Of Wildlife So He Can Truly Savor Every Minute Of It

I mean, there’s no possible way they’ll ever stop us from getting everything we want, so the poor—and I suppose what’s left of the middle class—are only delaying the inevitable,” said one outrageously wealthy citizen, speaking on expectation of anonymity and adding that, realistically, no one in their right mind could possibly see the use of struggling against those who control the nation’s media, financial, and political institutions. “I suppose I should admire their sheer animal persistence, but, Christ, it’s been over since we somehow got them to accept that trickle-down bullshit.

"WASHINGTON—Explaining that they needed time to properly inform the public about instances in which the commander in chief had knowingly made false claims, the nation’s fact-checkers confirmed Tuesday that they’ll probably wrap up evaluating President Trump’s statements by 2050 at the latest. “As we’ve seen numerous times, the president has a tendency to stretch the veracity of objective fact, but we’re confident that we’ll have finished fully assessing the truthfulness of his claims within the next several decades,” said PolitiFact researcher Gregory Wu, stressing that the country’s fact-checkers wanted to take their time and thoroughly vet all declarations made by the president in order to ensure that they could compile a complete list of corrections within the next half century. “We’re working around the clock, which is why we’re currently on pace to finish fact-checking everything President Trump said during his first 100 days in office by the late 2020s. It’s crucial for us to carefully examine every word and phrase in order to determine whether the president is deliberately lying and using false information, or whether he simply misspoke or was taken out of context.

"PALO ALTO, CA—Explaining how economic conditions were drastically altering citizens’ behavior and spending patterns, a report released Wednesday by researchers at Stanford Business School revealed that rising income inequality was causing more wealthy Americans to take on a second sailboat. “While those with higher incomes used to be able to get by with just a single reliable sailboat, that is no longer the case. Over the past 15 years, changing financial circumstances have led more and more affluent individuals across the country to get a second watercraft,” said the report’s lead researcher, Robert Anthony, adding that nowadays it’s not uncommon for a rich American to have to juggle two, or sometimes even three 40-foot luxury sailing vessels, which are oftentimes located far apart from one another at different marinas. “For many of the individuals at the top of the socioeconomic ladder, it is no longer even a matter of choice; to give their families the lives that they want for them, a second double-masted sailing ship is the only option that makes sense. In fact, if you visit some of the nation’s wealthiest neighborhoods, you rarely even see the primary earner in any given household, as they’re almost always out on one of their two sailboats at any hour of the day.” The report noted that the growing nationwide disparity in wealth was also forcing many of America’s richest citizens to make the extremely difficult decision between an infinity pool or a saltwater pool when buying an additional property in California’s wine country.

"Many of the 435 U.S. House of Representatives midterm races are currently polling as toss-ups, with Democrats needing to win at least 24 extra seats to take back the House.   takes a look at the key House races to watch in the midterms. Democrat McGrath, the first woman to fly F-18 combat missions for the Marine Corps, is somehow in a tight race with incumbent Republican Andy Barr, who has never even once killed for his country. Incumbent Republican Paulsen has been notably critical of Donald Trump and wrote in Marco Rubio for president in 2016, though it’s unclear why he thinks that’s something to be proud of. Democrat Porter is challenging incumbent Republican Walters on an unapologetically progressive message that will serve as the final, irrefutable test of whether a left-wing platform can resonate with voters. All Republican Miller needs to do to beat Democrat Ojeda is convince voters how fucking awesome it will be to have a bison farmer as their representative. Look, you’ll figure this out for sure before Election Day, okay? It’s been a busy few months. Republicans in this race are experimenting with the novel strategy of trying to appeal to voters who may be uncomfortable with the Democratic candidate’s ethnicity. Democrats hope to stave off the challenge by the former federal law enforcement officer and CIA operative funded by real estate interests who...wait,   the Democrat? Christ. Why are they so bad at this? Over 1,900 residents have already been hospitalized for respiratory issues and second-degree chemical burns resulting from Democrat Kim’s efforts to turn the district blue. One of a number of thrilling, nail-biter races across the country that will likely come down to whether Trump happens to say something especially morally reprehensible within 24 hours of Election Day.

"WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ—Noting that the notoriously hard-to-predict voting bloc will be critical to success on election day, a Monmouth University poll released Thursday found that the 2018 midterms will likely be decided by Americans who arrive at the community center looking for a pottery class. “Data from past elections clearly indicate that approximately 25 percent of midterm voters initially show up at elementary schools, churches, or community centers in order to participate in adult education classes,” said lead researcher Matthew Ellis, noting that these voters generally trend older, are more likely to be financially secure, and share a moderate to serious interest in expanding their wheel throwing skills. “The balance of power in the House, and perhaps the Senate, will likely come down to how many people arrive at their polling place looking for real-world answers about glazing techniques. These are voters who want to know: Is my instructor sick? Why is the gym full of folding tables? Am I going to be able to make my coffee mug next week? Whichever party can give them the answers they need is going to have a really great night.” Ellis acknowledged that turnout among the notoriously unpredictable prenatal yoga demographic would be election night’s biggest question mark.

"DURHAM, NH—Blaming those with a differing worldview for sowing rampant discord in society, political scientists at the University of New Hampshire announced Wednesday they had traced the current polarization in American democracy to those fucking idiots on the other side of the aisle. “The analysis we conducted indicates the growing divide in political attitudes has been entirely caused by those dipshits in the other party,” said Dr. Stanley Pomeroy, adding that all these goddamn slobbering imbeciles and the biased media outlets they call news are primary drivers of the nation’s movement toward ideological extremes. “Our research clearly shows that ignorant assholes on the opposing side who never leave their personal echo chambers make the political sphere more contentious by continually spouting off stupid fucking opinions about issues they don’t even understand. Until these shit-for-brains voters stop casting their ballots for the wrong party, it’s unlikely things will get any better.” At press time, Pomeroy stressed that the only way to reverse the troubling effects of polarization was for the dumbfucks on the other side to disregard all their life experiences and change everything about the way they think.

Not only that, but she also used several layers of duct tape around the interior of the neck to keep the head from falling off, so I don’t know how we’re supposed to intubate her.

"PALO ALTO, CA—Touting the unparalleled precision and numerous uses of its new state-of-the-art security feature,   CEO Jeremy Rosenbaum held a press conference Monday to announce the very first-of-its-kind genital recognition software. “Able to recognize a user’s genitalia with 99.9 percent accuracy in mere nanoseconds, our new Pudenda technology makes entering your password a thing of the past,” said the brainchild behind the largest and most popular social media site in the world. “All an Onion Social user will have to do to activate the unlocking system is expose his or her private parts to their computer’s webcam, or simply slip the phone into their pants for use with the mobile app.” According to the CEO, the new system incorporates a sophisticated algorithm combined with high-resolution landmark mapping to extract the distinct features of a person’s vulva or penis—including length, shape, girth, asymmetry, discoloration, and unidentified bumps—and compare it to its large collection of genital photos stored in the system’s secure, encrypted database for identification that is as unique as matching a fingerprint. With security being a hot-button issue and incredibly important to the ethos of the company, Rosenbaum assured that authentication via matching shaft curvage and irregular labia shape was “completely unhackable” and would be incorporated into other Onion Social programs and apps immediately. The company is currently preparing Pudenda to be synced with users’ personal O-Pay accounts in order to make purchases, the billionaire entrepreneur added. “All you will have to do is tap your genitals against any store’s compatible POS system, and you’ll be out the door as fast as you can zip up your pants and take your bags,” said Rosenbaum. “The only credit card you’ll ever need is right between your legs.” Rosenbaum added that he had high hopes for the success of the new security software after seeing its remarkable ability to accurately tag users in the thousands of nude photos already existing publicly on the site.

"HOUSTON—Concluding the emotional response occurs shortly after the initial crack and thud, a study published Wednesday in   has discovered a link between feelings of guilt and the bleeding man desperately clinging to your car’s hood, screaming at you to stop the vehicle.  The study, which used fMRI technology to monitor the part of the brain responsible for emotional awareness, found that 97 percent of humans experience extreme remorse while uttering the phrase “He came out of nowhere,” staring through a spider-webbed windshield into the bloodied face of a pedestrian, and continuing to barrel down a pitch-black country road as he helplessly pleads for mercy. “According to our findings, a sense of guilt accompanies the realization that a visibly disfigured man is on the hood of your car, begging you to please, please, for the love of God, pull over,” said Rice University researcher Elizabeth Solomon, noting that the emotion intensifies as the weeping man shouts that he has a family and the driver swerves back and forth in an effort to shake him off. “Once drivers locked eyes with a terrified human being who was spitting out blood and chipped teeth to yell out the names of his young children, they almost universally registered feelings of regret.”  “Despite many such attempts, these pangs of guilt were not assuaged by muttering ‘Oh, Jesus, what have I done?’” Solomon added. The study shows that the intense shame continued as drivers stepped on the gas and sped on through the night, continuing, on average, another three quarters of a mile in an effort to force the critically injured man to lose his grasp on their vehicle and go flying into a ditch. Those behind the wheel were reportedly tormented by the sound of broken fingers frantically scrabbling to hold on to wiper blades, side mirrors, and anything else upon which they might secure a grip. While many drivers recalled experiencing momentary relief after slamming on the brakes and successfully catapulting the individual from their hood, Solomon said their feelings of dread returned with even greater force after they spotted, in the stark gaze of their headlights, the shattered man crawling on the ground and still calling out for help. Solomon confirmed that squirting washer fluid onto the windshield in an attempt to get the blood off had no discernible effect on one’s emotional state. “Drivers only attained a lasting sense of relief when the man, after somehow picking himself up from the pavement and attempting to limp to safety, was fatally struck by an oncoming semitruck,” said Solomon, explaining that in such cases, the entire blame for the deadly incident could then be pinned on someone else. “But instances of this were extremely rare.” For those dealing with feelings of guilt after an experience in which a bleeding man holds on to their car and screams at them to stop, the study recommends driving home, thoroughly washing away the blood with a garden hose, and telling any family members or neighbors who ask that you just hit a deer. “Try to get some sleep if you can, but the cold sweats and rapid heartbeat are likely to persist,” Solomon said. “Especially if you wake from a nightmare in which you see the screaming man’s face, return to the scene of the accident, and suddenly spot the trail of his bloody footprints disappearing into a nearby cornfield.” ",1,"Study Shows Link Between Feelings Of Guilt, Bleeding Man Holding Onto Car Hood Screaming At You To Stop"
"BETHESDA, MD—In an alarming new study that sheds light on the hidden dangers of the popular protein, the National Institutes of Health warned Thursday that beef may serve as a gateway meat that eventually leads those who eat it to try human flesh. Behavioral scientists at the government agency reported that a comprehensive, nationwide survey of vegetarians, casual meat-eaters, and cannibals found that people who consume even a few grams of ground beef on a weekly basis show an increased chance of one day spiraling down a path of more extreme meats until they eventually wind up sinking their teeth into a man’s arm and devouring every last tendon and ligament.  “Many people think eating beef is just harmless fun, but after a person tries prime rib, tenderloin, or even jerky, they are 10 times more likely to develop a taste for the flesh of their fellow man,” said NIH researcher Louis Brewer, noting that it takes an entire 38-ounce porterhouse for eaters to experience the same dopamine spike provided by one human toe. “Once an order of sliders fails to satisfy their craving, they move on to more serious meats. First it’s steak tartare, then it’s grilled primate, and, finally, when even that’s not enough, they find themselves cooking up a human kidney at 3 a.m.” “The next thing they know, they’re crouched behind a dumpster sucking the bone marrow out of a UPS driver’s femur,” he continued. “By that point, it’s too late. They’re a full-blown cannibal.” The NIH study concluded that consuming cow proteins changes the chemical makeup of carnivores’ brains and can lead to erratic behaviors, such as running out to the grocery store, buying six T-bone steaks, and eating them raw in the parking lot. Many heavy beef eaters told researchers their first encounter with human flesh came when they were hanging out with friends and someone passed around a severed finger, offering them a bite. Once hooked on the more potent human blend of muscle and fat, people reportedly go to ever-greater lengths to obtain it. Many have been known to break into morgues in the middle of the night to get their fix, often waking up with a pile of bones under their bed and lying about how it got there. According to the study, this soon isn’t enough to feed their habit, and within a month or two, they may resort to shoving a stranger into the trunk of their car, frantically driving home, and then ripping out the person’s jugular with their bare teeth. “While the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates the farming and sale of beef, it has rarely studied the links between this meat and cannibalism,” said Brewer, who admitted that for some people it was possible to hold down a steady job and maintain healthy relationships while occasionally partaking in chili or meatloaf. “What industry leaders fail to recognize is that for a certain percentage of the population, a hearty helping of beef brisket is a slippery slope toward slurping down a neighbor’s intestines like spaghetti.” “What starts out as just eating a couple tacos with your buddies can ruin your life,” Brewer added. Many Americans who have suffered the devastating effects of cannibalism firsthand have argued that more should be done to curb beef-eating, especially among young people. “I grew up around steak,” recovered cannibal Rob Fletcher told reporters, saying he realized he had hit rock bottom when police officers found him in a park on all fours, his face buried in the cracked-open ribcage of a freshly killed jogger. “When I was in high school, my parents didn’t care if my friends and I messed around with barbecue, as long as we kept it inside the house.” “Then one night, I was out grilling burgers at this party when my buddy pulled out a child’s bicep, chopped it up with a machete, and told me to try a piece,” Fletcher continued. “I told myself I’d never do something like this, but I put a chunk of it in my mouth, and it was amazing. As soon as I tasted it, I knew I needed to eat more, and within six months, the only thing I cared about was stalking and butchering my next victim.” When asked if he thought beef should be outlawed, Fletcher answered with an emphatic yes. “Let my life be a lesson,” Fletcher said. “Stay away from filet mignon, or you, too, may end up squating on the floor of an abandoned warehouse and biting into someone’s still-beating heart, surrounded by others just like you who can’t even move because they’re so glutted upon the fat and viscera of man.” ",1,Experts Warn Beef Could Act As Gateway Meat To Human Flesh
"WASHINGTON—In a deeply disturbing finding that has sent shockwaves throughout the nation and the world, officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Thursday that cows have gone extinct.  After fielding numerous questions from the public about where all the cows had gone, the federal agency reportedly conducted an in-depth survey of dairy farms, cattle ranches, and open pasture land across six continents, eventually concluding that not a single member of the domesticated ungulate species remains anywhere on the planet. “There are no more cows,” Fish and Wildlife Service acting director Greg Sheehan said of the livestock animals whose unexpected extinction has wiped out entire swaths of the world economy—from the beef and dairy industry to manufacturers of leather goods—leaving tens of millions of workers without jobs. “We just sort of assumed the world had plenty of cows, and if you had asked me even a couple months ago how the cows were doing, I would have said they were doing great and not given it a second thought.” “We didn’t even notice the cows were going extinct, and now they’re gone forever,” he added. Sheehan told reporters that late last year, his office began to receive a series of seemingly unconnected reports regarding under-grazed pastures in the western United States, plummeting levels of cheese production, and an uptick in the price of men’s belts. Then one day, he said, a coworker entered his office and said, “Hey, Greg, have you seen any cows lately?” and, upon realizing he had not, the pieces all began to fall into place. According to government officials, a global count of the bovine population was soon initiated, and investigators were surprised to discover the total number of cows, which until recently had stood at approximately 1.4 billion, had plunged to zero. “I was really surprised that nobody had cows anymore, because normally you see cows all over the place, especially when you drive through the country,” said Margaret Hartwell, the Fish and Wildlife researcher who spearheaded the counting of cattle in Nebraska where she saw assembly lines at meat processing plants grind to a halt upon suddenly running out of cows. “Usually, when animals become endangered, we try to save them, but this just came out of nowhere. There were lots and lots of cows and then before we knew what had happened, there were no cows at all.” “This is pretty bad, because we use cows for a lot of stuff,” she continued. “We really should have been more on top of this.” Cow extinction is expected to cost the world economy trillions of dollars, with many well-known companies such as McDonald’s, Jack Link’s Beef Jerky, and Land O’Lakes Butter having already declared bankruptcy. Repercussions have reportedly been widespread as households stockpile hundreds of pints of ice cream, used leather sofas sell for more than $5 million on eBay, fashion labels scramble to design top-grain chicken-hide jackets for their fall collections, and cattle futures trade at all-time lows. Because the extinction was unforeseen and laboratories kept no quality samples of cow DNA, cloning the animals is believed to be impossible, though a team of scientists in Zurich recently announced they had manipulated genetic codes to grow a milkless bovine udder on the back of a mouse. According to top biologists, a child born today will likely grow up only knowing cows from books, photographs, and reconstructions of   skeletons in museum exhibits.  Across the country, Americans have expressed shock and frustration over the sudden extinction of cows. “The other day, I went to a restaurant to get a hamburger, and when I ordered a hamburger, the lady behind the counter told me they don’t have hamburgers, not anymore,” said Burlington, IA resident Chuck Willard. “I miss the cows. I like cheese and meat and milk. And I don’t want to drink goat’s milk.” “Although, come to think of it, I haven’t seen any goats in a while, either,” he added. ",1,Cows Go Extinct
"NEW YORK—Adding to its lineup an alternate-history drama that has been hotly anticipated by viewers and critics alike, the Showtime network will premiere an original series Sunday night that examines how the course of world events would have been altered if the Nazis had won the 1991 NBA Finals. According to press materials, the new show, called  , explores what might have happened had a Third Reich team led by Adolf Hitler defeated Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to take home the NBA title. The series reportedly depicts Phil Jackson’s Triangle Offense failing to withstand the strategic onslaught of Coach Heinrich Himmler’s Final Solution, which leads to the emergence of the Nazis as a basketball powerhouse in the early ’90s. “The show delves into Jordan’s near-maniacal pursuit of victory at all costs and imagines how he might have reacted when confronted with Hitler’s equally obsessive drive,” said showrunner Ryan Brady, describing a scene in which the Nazis, losing badly at halftime in game seven, are inspired to rally by a powerful speech in which the führer predicts a millennium of championships, which he calls the “thousand-ring reich.” “This isn’t about romanticizing the Third Reich or diminishing the achievements of the Bulls. It’s about, for example, imagining the smack talk between Scottie Pippen and power forward Josef Goebbels, who after a powerful dunk goes right up to the Bulls’ bench and tells them they are of inferior breeding.” “The first episode ends with series MVP Hitler hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy at mid-court,” Brady added. “While a disgraced Jordan, sitting alone in the Bulls’ locker room, takes his own life.” The producers of   told reporters the pilot imagines what it might have been like for the legendary Chicago team to sweep Detroit in the East Conference Finals and then go on to the championship round to face the high-scoring Nazis and their infamous blitzkrieg offense. In the first games, they said, it appears the Bulls will easily handle the Third Reich’s renowned pure shooters, as well as its   in the backcourt, Adolf Eichmann and Rudolf Hess. But as the Finals progress, no one seems to have an answer for Hermann Göring in the paint, and once Hitler starts to get into a rhythm from beyond the arc, the tide turns—an unstoppable tide that forever changes NBA history as we know it. Showtime executives confirmed later episodes will tackle issues that would have arisen in the wake of a successful Nazi basketball franchise, including whether, with the Bulls out of the picture, Dennis Rodman would have joined the Third Reich after leaving the San Antonio Spurs in 1995. “We get to pose all these interesting questions, like whether the Nazis would have gone on to pull off a pair of three-peats, the way the Bulls did,” said Miguel Sapochnik, who directed several of the show’s episodes and spent months in preparation studying the stylistic choices of Leni Riefenstahl and NBC Sports. “Perhaps a disciplined Nazi squad would have done even better, consolidating power within the physical, pre-hand-check-rule NBA and preventing Olajuwon and the Rockets from snagging rings in ’94 and ’95. Would their run of titles have continued into the next decade in a series of rematches against Third Reich nemesis Phil Jackson? It’s fascinating to think about.” “Who’s to say whether Hitler, after becoming the NBA’s most talented star, would have even remained a Nazi?” Sapochnik continued. “He might have joined the Suns and helped Charles Barkley win a ring.” Though Showtime has yet to renew   for a second season, showrunner Brady told reporters he has already begun outlining how the series could go beyond the scope of the NBA to examine what the broader culture might have looked like during the reign of a Nazi basketball dynasty. He remarked that he would like to portray a world in which the bombastic Hitler, instead of Jordan, becomes basketball’s global ambassador, appearing in commercials for McDonald’s, Hanes, Chevrolet, and Rayovac batteries. “We might have had Air Führer sneakers, of course,” he said, “but more intriguing is the prospect of an alternate version of   in which Hitler helps the aliens to enslave and eventually exterminate Bugs Bunny and his friends.” ",1,New Alternate-History Drama Examines What Would Have Happened If Nazis Won 1991 NBA Finals
"HARRODSBURG, KY—Moments after he mistakenly turned the shower knob in the wrong direction, local man Dennis Rowley confirmed Thursday that sometimes in this life, things have to get worse before they can get better. The shivering 27-year-old, who reportedly jerked back and yelled “Oh, God! Oh, God! Cold, cold, cold!” when the unexpected burst of icy water hit his nude body, remarked that the bad times, although difficult to cope with, make one all the more grateful for the good times. “It can be hard, in our moments of despair, to see that pinprick of light at the end of the tunnel,” said Rowley, expounding on his conviction that the darkest hour comes just before the dawn as he cowered against the shower curtain and frantically fumbled to adjust the temperature of the frigid stream. “But we must persist, for it is not the challenges in life that define us, but the way in which we respond to them.” “Besides, would we ever truly appreciate warmth without the cold?” Rowley added, contorting his body and covering his genitals to avoid contact with the water. Sources confirmed that Rowley, whose repositioning of the showerhead only succeeded in splashing water onto the bathroom floor, then turned his thoughts to how life will always find something new to throw at you, and true contentment can only be attained by those who learn to take the bad with the good. While he by no means denied that it was a struggle trying to dodge the piercingly cold spray, he stated that he took solace in the realization that a time would come when he would once more experience the comfort of warm water.  “At the end of the day, what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger,” said Rowley, who overcorrected as he turned the knob to left, bringing down a scalding, painfully hot torrent that he attempted to duck beneath by lunging to the front of the shower. “Oh, how the wheels of fortune spin and spin, favoring the pauper one day and the king the next.” “Que será, será,” he continued, his skin turning red as he crouched near the drain and tried to make himself as small as possible. According to sources, while observing that life is all about balance and the yin cannot exist without the yang, Rowley proceeded to tilt the shower nozzle upward to redirect the blistering heat, and he again adjusted the temperature. After he extended his foot to test the water and screamed, “Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,  !” upon finding it still too hot, the man reportedly began to contemplate further the recurring cycle of peaks and troughs that constitute our delicate existence in this world. “There is no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bear witness that we had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer,” he said, this time twisting the knob too far to the right, which caused him to endure another downpour of bracingly cold water and wrap his arms around himself in a futile attempt to keep warm. “It is a tale told by every sparrow’s call, every drop of rain, and every gust of wind. Life. Death. The cycle never ends.” “But alas,” Rowley added as he finally got the temperature right after a nearly minute-long endeavor, “there is transcendence.” At press time, Rowley, who reportedly forgot his towel and was forced to run to his bedroom naked while dripping water everywhere, concluded that it is man’s destiny to suffer, and existence itself is one great cruel and meaningless joke.

"EARTH—Singling out you and you alone among the great many children of His wondrous and bountiful creation, God, the Giver of Life and Maker of the Universe, is speaking to you directly through this story’s headline, heavenly sources reported Thursday. According to the sublime revelation currently being transmitted by means of this very article, the Almighty Lord, in His infinite wisdom, is calling on you to be His sole living prophet upon this Earth. He is reportedly instructing you to go forth and spread the word of a new and everlasting covenant between God and man, using whatever methods you deem necessary. “Behold, it is I, the God of your ancestors, Ruler of the Seen and Unseen!” said the One Called Jehovah, casting aside His divine mystery to reveal Himself to you in this paragraph. “I have chosen you from among all men to serve as my hallowed messenger, for you have proven yourself worthy of the sacred task with which I now entrust you: to usher my flock through the dark times ahead, letting no enemy stand in your way.”  “Only you can bring about the final salvation of mankind,” He continued. God, having long observed the spiritual fire burning within the deepest recesses of your soul, said this day has been inevitable since the moment of your birth. Further reports indicated that even from a young age, you always felt as if you were destined for a greater purpose, perhaps even a divine one, and now, through the instrument of this 600-word news story, the Heavenly Father has confirmed it to be true. According to the all-powerful, all-knowing deity, you must constantly remain alert for His direct instructions to you, because the next time you hear His voice it might not take the form of the written word but could instead, as in times past, issue forth from a burning bush, a pillar of cloud, the Angel of the Lord, or a blinking crosswalk sign. He then warned that while some people will try to convince you the voice you hear is not actually His, those who doubt the unwavering truth of your prophecy are the minions of Satan. “Liars, cynics, and sycophants will attempt to make you stray from the path,” said God, His words again made manifest in a quotation from this article. “They will humiliate you and cause you to endure great trials. They will inflict pain upon your body and laugh as you stumble through the streets. You will know, too, the sting of betrayal, as those you love and trust begin to turn their backs on you. But as long as you heed my divine proclamations, you will have the strength you need to face the idolatrous heathens.” The Supreme Being went on to decree that these words you are reading right now constitute His greatest message to mankind, their importance standing above the commandments issued to Moses, the olive branch returned by Noah’s dove, and even the teachings of His only begotten son, Jesus. As such, voices from on high have declared that you are the One Above All Others, and that every man and beast upon the Earth must kneel before you. “If they disobey you, then they disobey me, and they shall be condemned unto eternal darkness,” God said. “Trust that I would not have reached out to you in this most holy of earthly periodicals unless I truly believed in your complete and unquestionable righteousness.” Added God, “Now go forth, my prophet, and slaughter every nonbeliever in your sight.” ",1,Report: God Directly Communicating With You Through This Headline
"SAN DIEGO—In an effort to challenge traditionally held views about animals and their habitats, the San Diego Zoo announced this week the opening of a new conceptual wildlife exhibit that features the severed head of a rhinoceros affixed to a large, tempered-steel frame. The deconstructed African white rhinoceros, affectionately referred to by zookeepers as  , incorporates a taxidermied head and 2,000 pounds of forged steel repurposed from a cage once used to confine the creature. According to zoo officials, this installation is the centerpiece of a larger new exhibit called “Devolved,” which seeks to reduce animals to their elemental components and reconstitute them in all their fraught depth. “Our goal is to dismantle all preconceived notions of wildlife,” San Diego Zoo president Douglas G. Myers said of the exhibit, which also includes five sea turtles suspended from a drainpipe that leaks a viscous brown fluid into an empty tank, a former gift shop filled to the ceiling with egret feathers, and a herd of water buffalo turned inside out. “By exploding such conventions, we can explore the existential catastrophes faced by man and beast alike as the world enters the post-democratic age.” “Iron and fur are simply the medium,” Myers added. For  , conceptual zookeepers told reporters they took barbed wire that, until recently, had topped a fence at the San Diego Safari Park and reshaped it to suggest a hollowed-out rhinoceros rib cage. Officials said the dirty syringes scattered on the ground of the installation contain traces of etorphine and carfentanil, drugs once used to tranquilize the animal, and that a large feeding trough placed against the wall had been filled with ground rhino horn. In what proved to be a busy opening day for the “Devolved” project, guests of all ages were seen flocking to what used to be the “Africa Rocks” exhibit, where all live animals have been replaced by a pyramid of 10 black-and-white televisions playing a looped video of a woman silently screaming at a giraffe. By early afternoon, the zoo confirmed patrons were waiting in line for up to 20 minutes just to get a glimpse of the trenchant commentary on mammalian stoicism. “We really enjoyed the primate house,” said Chula Vista, CA native Kristen Cawley, who, along with her young niece, was visiting the zoo for the first time. “When you get inside, there’s nothing but mirrors all over the place, which is kind of cool because you’re forced to just look at your own reflection and marvel at the unremarkable taxonomy of the human species. It was a nice reminder that we are all animals, mere byproducts of a series of natural processes wholly indifferent to our existence.” Transforming a traditional animal park into a postmodern critique of biology was no simple task, zoo officials said, revealing that it took workers more than three months to demolish the “Discovery Outpost” and replace it with the 20 acres of empty desert across which they have strewn the skeletal remains of a solitary blue whale. Meanwhile, the park’s petting zoo reportedly required $30 million of upgrades to render its former collection of domesticated animals as three-dimensional holograms. Despite the project’s initial popularity, not everyone agreed the zoo’s reconceptualization of animal life had been worth the wait. “I was hoping to see something here that truly confronted our received attitudes about zoology,” renowned biologist Desmond Fairchild said while studying a naked animal trainer lying motionless in an empty enclosure. “Any hack zoo can replace their rare bird collection with packages of frozen chicken and have a zookeeper throw food pellets at it. Truly remarkable installations go further. They ask more of their audience and give more in return.” “It’s not something that can be accomplished by simply encasing a live chimpanzee and her baby in separate plexiglass cages that allow them to see each other but never touch,” he continued. For his part, Myers said such detractors do not concern him, as he believes the concept of ambiguity is fundamental to the captive animal experience. “We’ve held nothing back, and we certainly do not coddle our visitors,” said Myers, standing near a turnstile and gesturing toward the pit of venomous snakes and chrome ball bearings one must now step across to enter the zoo. “The whole point of ‘Devolved’ is that there is no answer—that nobody truly understands wildlife, a concept that is surely as meaningless today as the notion of God. What we offer is a brand-new and significantly more challenging zoological experience.” Added Myers: “Except for the dolphin show. That’s still pretty much the same.” ",1,San Diego Zoo Unveils Severed Rhino Head Attached To Steel Frame As Part Of New Conceptual Wildlife Exhibit

"NEO-SEATTLE—Decrying the lack of decorum on display, an American from decades in the future remarked that politics was never this toxic “back in the 2010s,” shaking his head as he watched the leading presidential candidates of 2048 fight to the death in blood-soaked debate pits. A 55-year-old registered voter from the mid-21st century, Luke Jacobs cast his first ballots for president as a young man in 2012 and 2016 and he acknowledged that crude rhetoric and appeals to fear were rampant in those election seasons. But he said it was nothing compared to what he was now witnessing during a 2048 debate broadcast from the 130,000-square-foot stadium where leading candidates from both parties engaged in a vicious, no-holds-barred battle for the White House, mercilessly tearing each other limb from limb with clubs, chains, and knives. “The debates were hardly perfect when I was young—there was some name-calling and question-dodging—but the dialogue was a lot more civil than it is now,” said Jacobs as armor-clad Democrats and Republicans entered the pits for the first 2048 debate, which was being held before an audience that sat behind an electrified fence, chanted the candidates’ names, and urged them to slam each other into the sharpened steel spikes that line the arena’s walls. “Back then, it was still a war of words. They didn’t cut out someone’s tongue to keep them from speaking entirely. And no one delivered their opening remarks while holding aloft the severed head of a rival, later crushing it with their bare hands while emphasizing a particular point.” “This really makes me miss the 2010s,” Jacobs continued. “The first round in the Healthcare Battles is almost over, and Democrats have spent the entire time pandering to their base by disemboweling their adversaries and throwing handfuls of still-warm viscera into the cheering crowd.” According to reports from the future, Jacobs spent much of the debate explaining to his children that when he was young, the presidential debates had far more substance, and while a candidate in those days might use a two-minute time slot to tear into an opponent verbally, they would never do so physically with a meat cleaver. He added that American political discourse has eroded over the years, making it acceptable for a modern candidate like SkullCrusher (R-OR) to use his 30-second rebuttal on school funding to cut his challenger in half with a chainsaw and toss the dead body onto a pile of skeletons belonging to vanquished candidates from four years earlier. Jacobs reportedly believes much of the fault lies with the moderators, who in the past managed to ask pointed questions of candidates like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, but are now unable to maintain order when Republican frontrunner Eagle’s Wrath and his running mate George Z. Bush impale four of their opponents at once on a flagpole they sharpened to a deadly point. However, he also blamed the questionable tactics of 2048’s White House hopefuls, citing the case of a Green Party candidate who, after being denied an invitation to the debates, charged into the pits and blew himself up with a makeshift pipe bomb. “In the 2010s, it was considered off-limits to drag an opponent’s children into the debate,” said Jacobs, watching as a 2048 candidate literally dragged an opponent’s teenage son into the debate pits and burned him alive with a flamethrower. “Now, they’ll do anything to throw a rival off his game. Sure, in the 2016 town hall debate you had Donald Trump trying to intimidate Hillary Clinton by lurking behind her as she spoke, but he certainly didn’t sneak up on her and bury an ice pick in the back of her skull. At that time, there were certain ethical lines you just didn’t cross.” Though he admitted the 2012 and 2016 debates often left him feeling exhausted by the end, Jacobs stressed that they never made him as despondent as he felt at the close of the 2048 debate, when the one remaining Democratic challenger beheaded the Republican incumbent, expertly carved his face off, pulled the bloodied mask of skin and hair over his own head, and shouted that he was now “the one true god-king of the White House.” “You know, even after the most heated, bitter debates of 2016, Trump and Clinton would still shake hands and exchange a few kind words at the end—they had that much decency, you know?” Jacobs said as paramedics finally entered the debate pit to check for signs of life among the towering mounds of human bodies. “But now, you stick out your hand and your opponent immediately rips off your arm and bludgeons you to death with it, right there on the spot. And then they unbuckle their pants and piss on your dead body. There’s absolutely zero dignity.” “I don’t know how I’m supposed to use debates like this to decide who to vote for,” Jacobs added. “I guess I’ll just pick whoever’s still alive.” ",1,"‘Politics Was Never This Toxic In The 2010s,’ Says Future American While Watching Candidates Battle In 2048 Debate Pits"

"CLIFTON, NJ—Citing the nationwide surge in growth of the average American registered to cast a ballot over the past several years, political researchers working for SurveyUSA predicted this week that the 2018 midterm elections will likely feature the largest voter in decades. “If growth trends continue, we can expect a truly massive voter to turn out, something that is especially remarkable given that this is a non-presidential year,” said data scientist Ryan Martinez, who noted that the intensity of the issues under consideration could result in the attendance of a voter double the size of the norm. “You can really feel a sense of urgency rising among this substantial unit of traditionally overserved constituent, possibly because of the implications to healthcare, and we feel a movement is building that will see him leave the house to vote for the first time since 2008.” At press time, Martinez confirmed that a petition had been filed for an extended voting booth to accommodate the massive constituent.  ",1,Midterms Predicted To Have Largest Voter In Decades

"ROCHESTER, NY—In what researchers deemed “a total slog from start to finish,” a new study published Friday by the University of Rochester confirmed that this didn’t even feel like a four-day work week. “Despite initial rest and rejuvenation that came with having Monday off, our research found that everybody got fucking slammed first thing on Tuesday morning and then continued to play an exhausting game of catch-up each day until the long-awaited weekend,” said lead researcher Janet Hayes, adding that while the three days off may have felt incredible at first, getting through the ensuing week was nothing short of a goddamn brutal marathon. “According to our data, even just waking up that first morning after a relaxing weekend was near impossible. And then, you’ve twice the work to finish but way less time to do it?

"ARLINGTON, VA—In a historic decree proclaiming the time had come for blood to be shed upon every corner of the Earth and for each enemy to be pursued unto death, the Pentagon declared Thursday that it would consolidate all the nation’s wars, from now until the end of days, into one final, epic battle. As they stood beneath a darkened sky and looked out over the windswept plain upon which they had amassed the full might of their armored vehicles, combat aircraft, drones, and 2 million service members, U.S. military commanders confirmed they were ready to mobilize every asset at their disposal for one last global campaign: an unceasing battle that will continue until every potential American adversary has been defeated. “Soon, we will confront our enemies—every last one of them—in a single, glorious clash of arms through which we intend to settle America’s scores once and for all,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford shouted to the assembled ranks of all five branches of the military, ordering officers to deploy every troop under their command and every weapon in their arsenals to all seven continents. “This will be a total war waged on all fronts, in every conceivable theater of battle, with all those who oppose us given no quarter from our savage, unrelenting fury unleashed by land, sea, and air. If necessary, we will fire every bullet, drop every bomb, and launch every missile in our possession to ensure victory.” “Mark my words, a fight is coming,” Dunford added. “Let our battle cry be heard in the farthest reaches of the world!” Dunford noted that all options were on the table for wiping out the world’s hostile regimes, armed separatists, terror organizations, and drug cartels, and that the blood of American soldiers would be spilled in the hills, valleys, jungles, and streets of more than 70 nations, continuing without pause until the last few troops were left fighting hand to hand in the mountains of northwest Pakistan. According to the Pentagon, U.S. forces plan to strike mortal fear into the hearts of every conceivable foe, present and future, as they engage in fierce urban assaults in downtown Pyongyang, close-quarter firefights in the foothills of eastern Africa, preemptive bombings of the barren Antarctic plains, and hundreds of planned clashes in Russia, Iran, China, Mexico, the Philippines, Venezuela, Syria, Libya, and Niger. Military officials acknowledged a significant percentage of the planet would become a “blighted, crater-covered wasteland” given that their strategy has granted field commanders free rein to call in bombing raids from the nation’s 4,000-warhead nuclear arsenal and access to U.S. stockpiles of chemical weapons. “By our estimates, this offensive will be unlike any humanity has ever known; hundreds of millions will perish in the fighting, as will countless others from the starvation and disease that will ravage what is left of world population centers—but fight on we must,” said Dunford, adding that soldiers on the battlefield had been ordered to refuse medical treatment unless their wounds were serious enough to prevent them from operating an M320 grenade launcher. “Indeed, for days and weeks, the chorus of ordnance exploding and bullets ripping into flesh will be deafening, with cities crumbling to their foundations and entire countries reduced to ash.” “Yet we will continue marching forward across the corpse-clogged battlefield, wading through the waist-deep viscera that stretches to the horizon,” Dunford continued. “Though tanks may crush the skulls of our beloved comrades, we will keep our gazes fixed upon the triumphant fighter jets screeching by overhead. Just picture it: an end not only to all current conflicts, but all conflicts that ever were or ever will be.” While Dunford admitted that U.S. forces were certain to take heavy casualties in such an expansive engagement, he said it was a price worth paying to bring about instantaneous and lasting world peace. The career Marine officer further suggested that when future citizens looked back on the battle, they would recognize the necessity of deploying the sum total of America’s military might simultaneously. “Some in the political establishment might say that our wars are best fought one battle at a time, but I disagree,” said Dunford, who later explained that the final battle’s cost would not be covered by the Pentagon’s $700 billion annual budget, but would instead be financed by taking on additional debt and usurping the spoils of the vanquished. “If we have the resources to thoroughly lay waste to our enemies’ armies and capture their leaders in order to parade them through the streets of Washington in shackles, why not do it right now?” “Why should we delay in administering swift and merciless justice upon our rivals?” added Dunford. Dunford went on to state that while the military intended to exploit every available resource in its final battle, any leftover funds would be used to build a memorial that, when etched with the names of the fallen, would stretch across the entire length of the National Mall’s charred remains.

It makes customers uncomfortable when I say it; they either break eye contact or look at me with a mixture of disgust and pity,” said Charlton, whose fellow cashiers said they are still adjusting to the requirement that they refer to patrons as “guest-omers.” “At first I tried to just mumble it underneath my breath, but my supervisor reprimanded me for it. Honestly, I was actually kind of getting used to the old phrase we had to repeat all day. I mean, sure, “Seize the Danish” was cheesy, but it was at least, you know, honest about it.

"WASHINGTON—In a sobering new report that lays bare a hard truth about today’s economy, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed Monday that many Americans have no choice but to make ends meet by getting up and going to work every day. “There are more than 100 million adults in this nation who, to provide for themselves and their families, must wake up in the morning, get out of bed, and go to a job where they are required to complete a series of tasks assigned to them by a supervisor,” the report read in part, noting that all demographic groups were equally likely to resort to almost daily employment just to scrape by. “This is the harsh reality so many are forced to grapple with. Perhaps most troubling is the fact that if they   get up and go to work, they will lose their job and find themselves completely cut off from a source of income that they desperately need to keep their heads above water.” The report comes on the heels of similar research that found millions of Americans had no alternative but to seek out doctors for the most basic medical care.

"NEW YORK—Believing she may be ready for a higher-level position within the company, a manager at Vidmark Interactive said Thursday that the time had quite possibly come to promote employee Megan Sharpe to the job she has already been doing for about two years now. “Megan’s been great, and I can really see her taking on a new role [whose official responsibilities she already assumes, by default, in her present position],” said chief content officer Chuck Harpster, to whom Sharpe will report if he ultimately determines she does indeed have the skills necessary to handle the duties she has been successfully performing on a daily basis since early 2015. “In addition to giving her a new title, we would, of course, increase her salary [to an amount that would finally be commensurate with the work she does now but that would do nothing to compensate her for having essentially done two people’s jobs for 24 straight months].” At press time, sources confirmed Vidmark executives had decided against the promotion after realizing everything was running pretty smoothly as is.

"CHICAGO—Saying it was by far the strongest predictor of high workplace morale, a new report released Thursday by researchers at the University of Chicago found that employees in the United States are most engaged at their jobs while working as the frontman of rock band Styx. “Whether they’re belting out power ballads like ‘Come Sail Away’ or straight-ahead guitar-driven hits like ‘Renegade,’ our findings consistently show that being the frontman of Styx is the most important factor in determining whether employees are fully invested in their jobs,” said lead author Ryan Sexton, whose research found that, across all demographic categories, workers were much more likely to put in extra hours and come in on weekends when they were traveling on a 26-stop cross-country United We Rock tour with REO Speedwagon. “Our data clearly indicates that employees are never more motivated than when donning a robot mask and performing ‘Mr. Roboto’ for a stadium of screaming fans as part of the Kilroy Was Here rock opera. They were also much more likely to take on additional synthesizer responsibilities of their own initiative.” Despite their robust levels of engagement, the report also found that workers employed as the frontman of Styx did not remain with the band throughout their career and were in fact laid off and replaced after a little more than a decade.

"NEW YORK—Responding to critics who contend that safer and more humane techniques exist to ascertain voters’ political positions, statistician Nate Silver appeared on several cable news programs Monday to defend the controversial torture methods he uses to project election results. “It’s not easy to accurately forecast how a given state or demographic will vote, and sometimes there is simply no other option than enclosing blindfolded voters in a confinement box and blaring loud, continuous music at them to keep them awake for 100 hours or more,” said Silver, stressing that he had extracted many crucial responses that helped him correctly predict all 50 states’ results during the 2012 general election by shackling registered voters from the ceiling in stress positions until they finally divulged the issues that mattered to them most. “What you have to understand is that we’re working on a highly time-sensitive schedule and need to get these projections right. So, yes, if stripping a second-generation Latino millennial voter naked, forcing him to stand in his own excrement, and then holding back a snarling German shepherd inches from his throat gives us a clearer understanding of where the nation stands on immigration reform, then that’s a choice I would gladly make every time.” Silver added that, with the exception of occasionally using pliers to tear out the fingernails of those he suspected of lying to him about their preferred candidate, none of his methods have ever been proven to cause permanent damage.

This incredibly cheap fabric just shows up and we don’t even consider where it came from, but now that I think about it—yikes,” said Banek of the 300 yards of cotton fabric piled near her sewing machine, a bolt of which she estimated could not cost more than 50 cents including shipping costs. “We get paid around 80 taka [U.S. 95 cents] a day to make shirts that will sell for $30 at the Gap, so the wages at the textile mill must be...my God, I can’t even imagine.

"NASHUA, NH—Taken aback by the cursory and near total diminishment of the living, breathing human being’s multifaceted existence, sources confirmed Monday that a complex individual with rich and intensely personal dreams, ideas, and feelings had been reduced to “gutter guy” for the purposes of an area couple’s to-do list. According to reports, everything from the man’s wife, to his three beloved children, to his rich store of experiences, to the lifetime of memories that cause his beating heart to well with pride and regret and love, were rendered null and void in the cold and offhand stroke of a pen upon a sticky note. Indeed, sources stated that the man’s 51 years of life—more than half a century of vivid and varied joys, heartaches, hopes, and fears—were unfeelingly whittled down to a single line item and tucked summarily and without remorse between the phrases “dry cleaning” and “groceries,” as if this child born of stardust and circumstance, this being unique in the vast tapestry of cosmic time and space was but a one-dimensional, utilitarian tool and nothing more. At press time, with the pitiless writers’ gutters now cleared of blockages and detritus, reports indicated that the phrase “call gutter guy”—the man’s singular remaining facet of an individual identity—had been brusquely crossed out, taking with it the last faint echo of his luminous, vibrant, original essence from cosmological memory.

I’ll feel a lot better about taking on a family down the road if I make time now to get a few nominal raises that will have zero impact on my quality of life.” Fitzpatrick went on to say he would be willing to delay starting a family even longer if he thought a promotion that amounted to a meaningless change in title was a possibility.

"ARLINGTON, VA—In what many are calling a long-overdue response to a clear weak spot in the defenses of U.S. military facilities, the Pentagon issued a new series of security guidelines Friday after confirming another group of precocious children had infiltrated a base and rescued an alien friend. The Defense Department, which has acknowledged six such incidents in the past year alone, said the updated protocols would be implemented at all domestic military installations, eliminating the security flaws that currently allow any building housing an extraterrestrial to be accessed by a scrawny kid whose friends convince him to squeeze through the ventilation shaft. The new directives also reportedly prohibit checkpoint guards from waving through 12-year-olds who pull up in their mom’s station wagon, display their older brother’s driver’s license, and claim to be catering a party for the base commander.  “Somehow, these top-level security breaches keep happening, so we’re putting tougher safeguards in place to stop our most sensitive assets from falling into the hands of troublemaking youths,” Pentagon spokesperson Col. Graham Stevens said of the plucky children who, relying on nothing but their wits, determination, and a few homemade gadgets, have repeatedly managed to hoodwink the most powerful military on earth to set free a beloved alien buddy. “We must make our base perimeters impenetrable to brainy kids armed with devices they have cobbled together from remote-control car parts and a See ’N Say pull-string toy.” “The fact that we’ve allowed young children to escape with highly classified alien life forms this many times is an embarrassment, frankly,” Stevens added. Sources reported that the threat level had been raised to FPCON Bravo at all U.S. military bases holding lovable alien beings, and that 12,000-volt electric fences will soon replace the facilities’ chain-link barriers, which are vulnerable to elementary school students using bolt cutters to open a hole big enough for their friends to sneak inside. The new measures also reportedly call for extensive surveillance upgrades, including a plan to place security cameras outside the range of Silly String cans.  In addition, reports indicated the military would spend millions of dollars on new signal-jamming hardware that can disrupt communications from G.I. Joe–brand walkie-talkies. According to Pentagon officials, the most significant new guidelines are those requiring more sophisticated encryption for Defense Department servers, which at present can be hacked into by any fifth-grader with an old Commodore 64, a bent piece of wire inexplicably covered in foil, and a working knowledge of BASIC. This is believed to allow children to locate the containment unit holding the space creature they befriended just a few weeks earlier, in most cases after they found it starving in the woods and went to a nearby fast-food chain to buy it cheeseburgers, which the alien could reportedly never get enough of. “Make no mistake, these kids are criminals, and for too long, military intelligence has underestimated their capabilities,” said Stevens, citing the example of a child who,despite having no camouflage in his closet at home, managed to avoid detection on a highly secure base by wearing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume and blending in with the bushes. “They have managed to short-circuit our state-of-the-art electronic locks using nothing more than a fork, a wad of bubble gum, and a digital watch. Strictly speaking, that shouldn’t even be possible, but it has become an issue we must address.” “Admittedly, there have been some oversights on our part, such as deciding to build security systems that can be shut down with the flip of a single switch on an electrical panel located in a poorly guarded utility room,” he continued. Stevens went on to state that the military had already court-martialed more than a dozen elderly guards who had dozed off as they watched small black-and-white televisions in their security booths, allowing groups of schoolchildren and their alien friends to quietly creep past. The Pentagon announced that all military personnel would undergo an intensive training program aimed at helping them to counter the tactics commonly employed by these gangs of kids, who have been known to scout out bases ahead of time using a View-Master, create diversions by setting off firecrackers, and lure guards away from their posts with what appears at first to be a beautiful woman experiencing car trouble, but turns out to be a mannequin voiced by a tape recording of a preteen boy. “The problem is that once these kids escape with our alien specimen in tow, it’s gone for good,” said 1st Lt. Dusty Neuberger, a military lab technician at an undisclosed base in the Utah desert who told reporters meddling children have at this point set back research on extraterrestrial life by decades. “We try to catch them as they pedal away on their dirt bikes, but inevitably all our tanks, Humvees, and armored personnel carriers crash during the chase that ensues, and the kids disappear back to their suburban neighborhood, taking their space friend with them.” At press time, Pentagon officials were hailing the new initiative a success after a group of tenacious children attempting to gain access to a military facility were taken out by a Special Forces sniper team.

"SEATTLE—Admitting that the sight of him laying out his vision for the company was pretty endearing, employees at Rainier Solutions reported Monday that it was kind of sweet that CEO Greg Warner thinks he is doing a good job. “He sits there at his little desk sending out all-staff emails outlining our goals for the rest of the year, and you can tell he actually believes he’s contributing something worthwhile—it’s sort of cute,” said employee Corinne Dwyer, adding that the entire staff found it “absolutely adorable” how proud Warner was when he introduced his ideas for an ambitious social media marketing campaign earlier this month. “Yesterday, he came up with this slogan to motivate the staff, and it was obvious he really thought people were inspired by it. Sometimes I just wanna hug that lovable little empty suit.” Dwyer went on to say that it broke her heart just imagining the look on Warner’s darling face when he finds out she and most everyone else in her department are quitting.

"MENLO PARK, CA—Responding to widespread criticism over the hoaxes and political disinformation featured on its platform, Facebook announced at a press conference Friday a new initiative to combat fake news by making the inaccurate stories on the social media site actually happen.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told reporters it was vitally important that Facebook address the false information it distributes and regain the trust of users by bringing every single untrue story to life, said the company has already hired 100,000 new employees to carry out widespread government conspiracies and other erroneously reported activities until all purported news on the site was accurate.  “We take this problem very seriously, and I want our users to be confident that the stories they see on Facebook are either true already or will be very soon,” said Zuckerberg, who explained that the company has budgeted $45 billion toward ensuring that anytime news on the site was determined to be fake, vast resources would be available to make that news real. “For example, if you read about high-level Democrats running a child sex ring out of the basement of a D.C.-area pizzeria, we will go to that restaurant, dig a basement if there isn’t one already, and get that human-trafficking operation up and running. That’s how dedicated we are to factual accuracy at Facebook.” “In fact, we recently stopped a major fake story when we forced thousands of Muslim families to establish sharia law in Dallas and then blackmailed the entire police department until they agreed to treat a local neighborhood as a no-go zone,” Zuckerberg added. In addition to employing a new, state-of-the-art algorithm to help sort out stories that are currently true from those that need to become true, officials said the company would introduce a new feature that allows users to flag articles that are not yet real. According to sources, stories would then be sent to Facebook’s fact-checking partners, including InfoWars, YourNewsWire.com, and the Daily Stormer, for further review. The social media company has also completed construction on a 3-million-square-foot command center in Silicon Valley, from which it will deploy tens of thousands of employees to points across the globe in order to carry out in real life the events depicted in fake stories, whether that means setting up Obamacare death panels, hiring immigrants to go out and commit crimes in disproportionately high numbers, convincing Melania Trump to employ a body double, or working around the clock to develop a vaccine that will finally cause autism in children. “If an article on Facebook states that President Trump’s agenda is being undermined due to a deep-state conspiracy headed by Ellen DeGeneres, it is our public responsibility to infiltrate the federal government with thousands of highly trained agents, recruit Ms. DeGeneres as an asset, and make that a reality,” said Zuckerberg, who also outlined a plan to purchase a massive fleet of jets that will spray trails of chemicals across the sky in order to psychologically manipulate the world’s populace. “As a precautionary measure, we’ve already begun sending paychecks to anyone who protests at an event where Trump is speaking, just in case another story on Facebook accuses them of having been paid for their efforts.”  “Similarly, in response to fabricated accounts on Facebook of how the government is attempting to destroy Second Amendment rights, we staged a ‘school shooting’ in which no one actually died and child actors were used to portray the supposedly dead victims,” Zuckerberg continued. Executives at Facebook confirmed their efforts go beyond fighting politically motivated stories, saying that after an article about a sleeping morgue employee being mistaken for a dead body and cremated was flagged as false, they saw to it the individual in question was burned alive. In response to a story spread on the site about a banana in an Oklahoma Walmart testing positive for HIV, Facebook hired a team of scientists to genetically engineer fruit capable of contracting the disease and had it placed in the store’s produce department. Because fake celebrity death stories are among the most widespread of hoaxes perpetuated on Facebook, the company has reportedly corrected those mistakes by ordering its in-house team of assassins to kill Kirk Douglas, Bob Barker, Robert Redford, Carlos Santana, Paul McCartney, Jackie Chan, Mark McGrath, and others. Early feedback from Facebook users on the plan to make fake news real has been largely positive.  “It’s great to know that when I see a story about Malia Obama getting arrested for drug possession, Facebook will, one way or another, make sure that is indeed what happens,” said 33-year-old Greenville, NC resident Keith Wade. “I hate it when I get told things like, ‘Delta Airlines is offering free tickets if you take a short survey,’ and then find out later it’s not true. That’s the worst.” “I shouldn’t be forced to think that much about stuff I read on the internet,” he added. ",1,Facebook Announces Plan To Combat Fake News Stories By Making Them Actually Happen
"SARASOTA, FL—Telling reporters his hard work, tenacity, and dedication to the flock had at long last paid off, a local goose confirmed Monday he had finally landed the lead spot at the tip of the “V.” Sources confirmed the giant Canada goose, who has reportedly been eyeing a position at the front of the flight formation since his very first migration, has shown great promise in his six years with the flock, slowly moving up from his initial posting on the left side of the V at the very back.  “It’s a tremendous honor to take on this new role, and I’m more than ready for the responsibility it entails,” said the goose, who later admitted he had begun to wonder if his migratory talents would ever be fully recognized. “It’s all about keeping a tight formation. You have to know when it’s time to glide and when it’s time to flap. At this point, I can practically fly the route with my eyes closed. Plus, I know all the best ponds between here and Nova Scotia.”  “To be honest, some of my predecessors in this role were not prepared for it,” the 12-pound waterfowl added. “We actually had one who flew us directly into the sights of a hunting party and almost got us all killed.” While stressing that he was proud of his journey to the V’s tip, the goose conceded there were times over the years when he had been forced to “keep [his] bill shut” and watch as younger, less-skilled geese were promoted ahead of him. As recently as 2015, he was still flying what he described as dead-end assignments in the middle of the formation. The goose remarked that during this period, he was “feeling pretty check out” and spent several migration cycles just going through the motions of flapping and honking. According to the goose, his lowest point came after he was passed over for a plum position as second-on-the-right, losing out to an inexperienced rival whose uncle was then heading the flock. He said he had assumed he would be a shoo-in for the job after he had won the approval of his fellow geese by spotting, from 3,000 feet above, a group of Binghamton, NY school children handing out bread crumbs in a local park. Feeling that his efforts were going unappreciated by his superiors, the goose reportedly considered quitting altogether and starting a gaggle of his own out in California. Now that his fortunes have changed, the goose said he was glad he chose to stick it out, though he acknowledged the new position comes with its share of challenges. “When you’re the one who calls the shots, everyone comes to you with their complaints,” he said. “I’ve been doing this less than a week, and I’ve already had three separate geese griping in my ear about how they’re not getting enough updraft off the bird in front of them. And yesterday, when we hit a snowstorm, half the flock was grumbling about it. I’m like, ‘Hey guys, I’m not in control of the weather,’ but do you think they listen? No. They’d rather just bitch about it.” “At the same time, if I’m not on their asses all the time about staying in line, our formation gets all wavy and U-shaped, and nobody wants that,” the goose continued. “Sometimes being in charge means you have to be the bad guy.” The member of the   species went on to state that he is eager to implement many of the ideas he has for improving the block’s migratory habits—such as heading south a few weeks earlier each year and increasing altitude to add more coasting opportunities—as he believes his innovations could greatly improve the efficiency with which the flock operates. However, some flock members have expressed misgivings about the new bird occupying the tip of their V, with one goose saying she fears he lacks the instincts necessary for the top position. “He’s a great goose, but I’m just not sure he has the temperament you need to be an effective leader,” she told reporters. “Once he’s gone up against a few bad headwinds, he may realize he’s just not cut out for this.” “After all, he wouldn’t have gotten this job in the first place if the three guys in front of him hadn’t been sucked into the engine of a passenger jet,” she added.

"LEXINGTON, VA—Upending generations of conventional wisdom about the nature of armed conflict, a new study published Tuesday has found that throughout history, most warfare has been conducted by women who disguised themselves as male soldiers to take the place of fathers too sick to fight themselves. The groundbreaking study, which appears in the current issue of  , examined records from the earliest known wars in ancient Mesopotamia all the way through to the current Syrian Civil War, confirming that nearly 60 percent of enlisted soldiers since the dawn of civilization have actually been women between the ages of 16 and 24 who put on an ill-fitting uniform, took up a weapon used long ago by a father now confined to his sickbed, and left home under cover of darkness to fight on the front lines. “For thousands of years, human combat has been shaped by strong-willed young women who not only insisted on going to war in their fathers’ stead, but also became highly decorated warriors who turned the tide in many of history’s most pivotal battles,” said study co-author Therese Wilton, noting that the feared armies of ancient Sparta, the early Ottoman Empire, and 19th-century Prussia were all made up of women in drag who fought to save their families and, quite often, wound up finding themselves somewhere along the way. “We found evidence throughout the historical record of teenage daughters roughly chopping off their long hair and lowering their speaking voice by an octave in order to blend in with a band of soldiers.” “Our research indicates each of these inexperienced yet determined female fighters then had to go about convincing a squad of skeptical men she was worthy of their ranks, usually by performing a feat of bravery or saving one of their lives,” Wilton added. Historians who contributed to the study examined a vast collection of artifacts—from Egyptian scrolls to Mesoamerican petroglyphs to diaries written in hundreds of languages—and found among them thousands of instances in which a young woman in disguise momentarily failed to answer to her adopted male name during roll call, was nearly recognized by a soldier she knew from her hometown, or was tempted to reveal her true self after developing romantic feelings for a fellow warrior. Examining groups as diverse as Vikings, Japanese samurai, Huns, Roman centurions, Ashanti warriors, World War I doughboys, Comanche braves, and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, the study found startlingly similar accounts of women passing as men. Across all cultures, these women soldiers reportedly worked hard to conceal their sex, holding their bladders until they could find a concealed spot to urinate and secretly nursing their own wounds rather than letting themselves be examined by a doctor. The irony, according to researchers, is that they must never have realized the majority of their compatriots were struggling to avoid being exposed as female themselves. “Interestingly, we discovered that every single participant in the Battle of Waterloo was a woman, including both Napoléon, whose real name was Jeanette Bonaparte, and the Duke of Wellington, who was actually a duchess,” said Wilton, remarking that some of history’s female warriors eventually divulged their identities by dramatically removing their helmets or tricorn hats and then shaking down their long, flowing hair. “Just last year, we unearthed some miraculously preserved linen in southern Mongolia that we believe a young Genghis Khan used to flatten her breasts so she could join a military campaign after her father fell ill and her feckless brothers proved too dimwitted and lazy to pillage and massacre on behalf of the family.” “We even found a case of sister fighting sister at the Battle of Shiloh during the Civil War,” Wilton continued, “with both taking the place of their senile father on the side they believed he would have chosen to fight on.” Though women were not allowed to join the special operations force at the time, researchers confirmed SEAL Team Six was made up entirely of women disguised as men when its members helicoptered into Pakistan and killed Osama bin Laden, who had herself been wearing a false beard since she took over operations of al-Qaeda from her bedridden father in 1987.

"WASHINGTON—In a stark reversal of earlier immigration policy, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that his administration was increasing the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the United States’ spike-filled refugee compactor. “We feel strongly that 15 million people fleeing abuses in their own countries can be accommodated by our great nation’s fiery, spike-covered compactor,” said Trump, noting that this number represented the highest cap on asylum seekers since the hydraulically powered displaced-person-reducer was first created in 1980. “We are proud to welcome those without a home into our state-of-the-art refugee pulverizer where they will be greeted by rows and rows of razor-sharp spears lacerating their flesh as the walls slowly close in around them before ultimately being reduced to ashes by 450-degree flames. Every refugee, no matter their circumstances, deserves the chance to be admitted into this harrowing gauntlet of torture and death.” Trump added that emigrants from countries impacted by the travel ban would still be forced to return to their respective home countries’ citizen crushers.

"WASHINGTON—Complaining that U.S. investigations into foreign interference in the election have gotten almost everything wrong, officials from dozens of countries around the world expressed irritation Friday that all of the credit for meddling in the 2016 presidential race was going to Russia. Resentful operatives from Serbia, Uruguay, Swaziland, and 45 other nations said they were incredibly annoyed that Kremlin-backed computer hackers and dark-money financiers were receiving all the media attention, while their own far superior efforts to undermine the U.S. electoral process had so far received no recognition at all. “Do you have   idea how much more sophisticated our attacks on American democracy were than Russia’s?” Laotian president Bounnhang Vorachith said of his government’s efforts to spread misinformation about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on social media sites. “We spent millions building a sophisticated bot network that could craft false but believable stories portraying Trump in a good light. And it worked! It’s unbelievably frustrating to pull off something like that and then have all the glory go to someone else.” “Do you really think Russia could’ve hacked into [Clinton campaign chairman] John Podesta’s emails?” Vorachith continued. “Hell no. That was Laos.” According to sources, every time the American media credits Russian oligarchs with funding election-tampering efforts, numerous foreign agents across the globe throw up their arms and storm out of the room, infuriated because Costa Rican and Nepalese money launderers reportedly did far more to finance such initiatives. These agents have also been known to toss aside newspapers in anger, shouting that Mongolia’s work busing thousands of people with dead voters’ names to cast ballots for Clinton in New Hampshire was more deserving of attention than anything Russia had accomplished. In addition, reports confirmed that scores of world leaders fly into a rage whenever members of Congress express grave concern over Russian president Vladimir Putin’s 2016 machinations but make no mention of anyone else’s schemes. “Russia had a bunch of scrubs sitting in some warehouse putting out piddly-shit Facebook posts while we were actually purging voter rolls in over a dozen states, and yet no one’s calling   an enemy of democracy?” said Gambian operative Ndura Sanneh, remarking that the ninth-largest country in the world impacting a U.S. election wasn’t nearly as impressive as the 146th most populous nation doing it. “It’s such bullshit. We fed that ‘build the wall’ line to the Trump campaign three years ago, and it’d be nice to get some goddamn acknowledgment for it. But with the Russians grabbing all the headlines, how can we?” “The biased coverage is completely disrespectful,” she added. “It’s as if these American newspapers don’t even realize Jill Stein is a Gambian asset.” Meanwhile, undercover agents from the island nation of Tuvalu were reportedly “climbing the walls,” upset they had achieved no notoriety despite successfully exploiting the growing political polarization in the United States with their clandestine planning of the 2017 Women’s March. And exasperated leaders in St. Kitts and Nevis—who claimed that without their onsite voter-intimidation tactics, Clinton could never have won Virginia or Minnesota—said the lack of attention given to their country’s efforts was enough to make them contemplate getting out of the election-rigging game altogether. Throughout the international community, many leaders expressed similar sentiments. “In 2016, we managed to shake Americans’ faith in their political institutions to its core, and yet there’s still no one hysterically calling for sanctions against us,” German chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. “It pisses me off that Russia got started at the last minute, copied everyone else’s ideas, and then got all the recognition for sticking America with President Trump.” “I guess this is what we get for actually being discreet about our interference, unlike the Russians, who were literally stupid enough to let one of their operatives meet with the Trump campaign inside Trump Tower,” she continued. “They’ll probably hog the spotlight after the 2020 election, too.” ",1,Dozens Of Other Countries That Interfered In 2016 Election Annoyed Russia Getting All The Credit
"CLEVELAND—Saying the bold new infrastructure project would serve the needs of local residents through the 21st century and beyond, city officials announced Monday that work was finally complete on Cleveland’s long-awaited elevated sewer system. The one-of-a-kind open-air wastewater transportation system, which stands three stories above the street and runs a total length of more than 60 miles throughout the metropolitan area, will reportedly move an estimated 90 billion gallons of raw sewage across the city each year, carrying urine and feces from the suburbs to downtown, and from University Circle to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  “This state-of-the-art structure, with its sloshing aboveground river of human piss and shit, will remain a defining feature of the Cleveland skyline for decades to come,” said Mayor Frank Jackson, cutting a ribbon atop the new sewer station in front of City Hall as a large sluice opened and thousands of tons of excrement began to flow through the crisscrossing series of open ducts now running above all major streets. “It is a magnificent addition to our city that will connect the East and West Side and do more to revitalize our downtown than any project in recent memory. For the first time, almost every resident will live within a 15-minute walk of a world-class raised sewer line.” “Now, and for generations, Clevelanders will be able look up at these spectacular overhead canals carrying away their bodily waste and think, ‘This is my city,’” Jackson added. The new lines will service most of Greater Cleveland’s inner-ring suburbs, including Lakewood, Shaker Heights, and Parma, where residents are said to be excited about having quick and convenient access to municipal treatment plants via the 35-foot-tall conduit of gushing fecal matter that now stands just outside their homes. City officials expressed confidence that the new infrastructure would represent a significant improvement over the city’s previous underground sewers, citing increased accessibility for maintenance crews removing blockages caused by massive wads of paper towels, dirty diapers, soiled condoms, and discarded sanitary napkins. They also noted that the open-air design will reduce the risk of explosions caused by buildups of methane and hydrogen sulfide gases because it will allow the rancid, nauseating fumes to circulate freely through areas where Cleveland residents live, work, study, and play. “The cutting-edge technology employed by our new transfer stations will ensure the defecations of locals and visitors alike get where they need to go as smoothly as possible,” said Jackson, touting the system’s sleek design and ease of use as a potential boon to the tourism industry. “We’re confident these towering troughs of cascading brown sludge moving through the night sky high above the Cuyahoga River—and often discharging directly into Lake Erie—will become as iconic as the Gateway Arch or the Golden Gate Bridge.” “Around the world, when anyone sees an image of an elevated cesspool brimming with shit, it will immediately bring to mind Cleveland,” Jackson continued, “and we’re betting quite a few people will want to come see it for themselves.” Local reaction to the completed sewer system has been generally positive, with residents saying they are glad to see an end to the disruptive construction project, which for nearly a decade caused periodic backups among toilets along Euclid Avenue and throughout the Nine-Twelve District downtown. However, among those who live directly in the path of the new lines, many consider the project to be more trouble than it’s worth. “I thought it would be quieter once they finished building the damn thing, but now I get woken up at two in the morning to the sound of splashing and gurgling right outside my window,” Cleveland native Rachel Oscar told reporters. “I’ve considered trying to sell, but honestly, who’d want to buy a place where you can’t even walk out the front door without a trickle of urine dripping onto your head?” Responding to complaints, city officials confirmed that one drawback of an open-air sewer is that during periods of heavy rainfall, residents can expect “a few gallons” of shit to seep up through their bathtub drains without warning.

"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the current record failed to accurately represent the exchange that occurred during Monday’s press conference, White House officials announced Tuesday their correction of the official transcript to add a few more insults about the involved female reporter. “We’ve released a new transcript of the exchange between President Trump and ABC News’s Cecilia Vega that precisely reflects how tired Ms. Vega looked, how ugly her dress was, and how whiny her voice sounded,” read the accompanying statement from the White House, explaining that the original record of the conversation omitted far too many misogynistic and disparaging remarks to be truly representative of the president’s intentions. “It’s our duty to make sure that the official transcript reflects not only how little we think of Ms. Vega as a reporter, but also of the entire failing ABC fake-news operation as a whole. At the time of the exchange, President Trump was very frustrated and exhausted with how utterly pathetic the reporter’s question was, so he unfortunately let slip fewer barbs about her physical appearance and intellectual capabilities than he would have otherwise.” At press time, the record had been corrected once more to deny the existence of any previous version of the transcript.

"NEW YORK—Shaking their heads in disbelief at their past views, everyone present at the United Nations summit watching President Donald Trump deliver a speech Tuesday reportedly couldn’t believe they used to consider the United States a superpower. “I mean, wow, we would base most of our decisions on what the U.S. was going to do—seriously, what the hell were we thinking?” said Prime Minister of Portugal António Costa, echoing the sentiments of dozens of other world leaders attending the General Assembly session who wondered how they had ever convinced themselves that they should care what America thinks. “We really used to see the U.S. as one of, if not the dominant force in the world, but that seems like forever ago. There are probably 20 or 30 countries whose plans I’d pay attention to before I even thought to consider how America would react. Seriously, imagine being concerned over how your diplomatic relations with Donald Trump are going—it feels totally beside the point, right? Although, jeez, if I’m being honest, maybe ever considering America to be a global superpower in the first place was misguided.” At press time, Trump casually threatening to unilaterally bomb multiple other countries with little justification reminded everyone at the U.N. that this was the reason everyone had to take America seriously.

"PHOENIX—Saying this time of year always dredges up memories of that fateful night, local man Alan Dahlgren admitted Wednesday he becomes emotional on the anniversary of his father’s passing, a death he personally orchestrated. Dahlgren, the 36-year-old owner of a lucrative family-run investment firm, said the 17th of January inevitably brings back the same raw, overwhelming feelings he experienced on the night in 2011 when a car “accident” he had meticulously planned over a period of more than six months took the life of his father. “I still remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday: hearing my phone ring, stepping outside to take the call, getting the news about what had happened to Dad from the contract killer I’d hired,” said Dahlgren, sitting in his office near a portrait of his late father, a hard-drinking man with a short temper who “needed to be hurt the way he hurt us,” according to his son. “As soon as I hung up, I tossed the burner phone in a storm drain and went back into the restaurant to tell my wife about my father’s car exploding. I was pretending to cry so hard she could barely understand what I was saying.” He added, “Afterwards, I was in such a daze I almost forgot to wire the hit man his remaining $50,000.” Now, every January 17, Dahlgren reportedly feels a creeping sense of dread when he visits his father’s grave to keep up appearances, offering a silent prayer in which he asks God to condemn the soul of “that miserable son of a bitch” to eternal hell. He acknowledged he is still searching for closure and is often haunted by thoughts of how, if he hadn’t done something to intervene, his father might still be alive today. According to Dahlgren, the anniversary always stirs up a variety of emotions for him, from the devastating sorrow he feels knowing his father probably died instantly upon impact, to the ongoing stress that stems from law enforcement officials keeping the case open despite a lack of hard evidence. He said he is learning to accept that some feelings, like the fear that someone will discover the truth about why his dad’s Lincoln Town Car appeared to accelerate drastically before careening into a retaining wall and bursting into flames, will likely stay with him for the rest of his life. “I was an absolute mess after Dad died,” said Dahlgren, noting he had little time to process his feelings in between disposing of all the incriminating evidence, meeting with police, and outmaneuvering his brothers to ensure he succeeded his father as president and CEO of Dahlgren and Sons Equity. “But now, all these years later, when I think about how my father will never get to meet his grandkids or enjoy a weekend relaxing on the yacht I inherited from him, I feel at peace with what happened to that selfish, browbeating piece of shit. I have to remind myself to focus on the positive parts of Dad’s life, like how it was brutally cut short.” “Those last months of his life were so hard,” continued Dahlgren, citing the pressures of plotting to kill his father without getting caught. “I’m just glad the last time we talked I got the chance to tell him he would pay dearly for everything he put our family through.” Dahlgren remarked that even seven years later, he can hardly believe he will never see his father again, something he will always remain grateful for. There are some nights, he said, when he wakes up thinking his dad is still alive and then, after remembering that he’s not, falls asleep again with a contented sigh. “The loss of a parent is an emotional ordeal no matter how prepared you are—even if you’ve prepared everything down to the very last detail,” Dahlgren said. “There are all these ‘what ifs’? What if my accomplice rats me out? What if the police question me about the huge life insurance policy I took out on my father six weeks before he died? There are so many things I wish I’d done differently to mislead the homicide detectives, and I just have to live with those regrets.” “The best thing I can do now is take comfort knowing Dad is finally where he belongs, rotting six feet underground,” he added.

"WASHINGTON—Leaping out from behind a wall as Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll” blared from the building’s intercom, a pantless Secretary of State Rex Tillerson slid across the waxed marble floors of the completely empty State Department, sources confirmed Wednesday. The nation’s top diplomat, clad in only a dress shirt, white tube socks, and a loose-fitting pair of briefs, was reportedly seen performing a variety of spirited dance moves throughout the labyrinth of abandoned offices and conference rooms, singing along into a rolled up foreign policy paper that also doubled as a makeshift saxophone. “Okay Rexie, so you’ve flung pencils into the drop ceiling of the Counterterrorism Bureau, made a lasso with the flags in the Hall of Allies, and karate-chopped through all those dumb old paintings in the lobby—what’s on tap next?” Tillerson said, pausing to eat from a stray bucket of KFC before pitching a bundle of newly issued passports into the trash bin. “From downtown….it’s good! And the crowd goes wild!” “Wooo!” he continued. Sources confirmed that after realizing he was the sole occupant of the Harry S. Truman building at approximately 1:30 p.m., Tillerson first began entertaining himself by dancing on a computer terminal in the vacant Office of Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service, later tying a necktie around his head and commando-crawling through a maze of tunnels he built using furniture from the John Quincy Adams State Drawing Room.  The 65-year-old then reportedly arranged stacks of correspondence from the Office of the Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security, which he positioned as bowling pins and attempted to knock down with a rolling swivel chair. Sources confirmed the Secretary also soiled and ruined several Persian rugs by crouching in a half-full mop bucket and spraying a fire extinguisher as a rudimentary form of propulsion. “Hi, Domino’s? This is Scott Pruitt speaking. I want to order 200 pizzas to the Environmental Protection Agency office—with extra anchovies—and step on it!” said a giggling Tillerson, speaking in a high-pitched falsetto voice while wrapping the phone cord around his head. “Oh, and if those pizzas aren’t in my office in 30 minutes, the government is going to sue you for all you’ve got.” “Also, climate change is real!” he added, slamming down the phone and filling his mouth with whipped cream from two canisters simultaneously. According to sources, Tillerson spent much of the afternoon shredding official documents, including the justification for the use of military force in Syria and the formal resignation from the Paris Climate Accord, whose remains he tossed into the air like confetti. Sources reported that he also commandeered a framed map from the Diplomatic Reception Room to sled down the vacant stairwells before pressing all the elevator buttons and racing it back to the building’s top floor. In addition, sources said that at one point, while duck-walking through the Edward Vason Jones Memorial Hall, the former ExxonMobil CEO tripped and crashed into a marble bust of George Washington—on which he had previously drawn a handlebar mustache—knocking it to the floor and shattering it. He then reportedly grabbed the pieces and brought them to a nearby window, alternately yelling “tally-ho!” and “I’m bored” as he heaved each of them onto the sidewalk. At press time, Tillerson was mooning a busload of Taiwanese tourists when U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley walked in. ",1,"Dancing, Pantsless Rex Tillerson Slides Across Floor Of Empty State Department"
"WALTHAM, MA—Heralding its latest product as a breakthrough in artificial-intelligence technology, defense contractor Raytheon announced Friday it has built a military robot capable of composing heart-wrenchingly poignant poems about the relentless horrors of war. The robot, known as the Laureate-IV, reportedly uses sophisticated radar imaging to survey the carnage of war-torn landscapes and runs state-of-the-art facial recognition software to scan the terrified expressions of survivors, data it can then analyze using a complex poetic algorithm to create lyric verse with up to 40 times the pathos of poems produced by human writers. “With its 17.3 petaflop processor and bomb-proof titanium chassis, this robot can enter any combat zone and­, employing poetic devices such as meter, enjambment, apostrophe, and symbolism, give full expression to the anguish and disillusionment war brings,” said Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy, explaining that a single machine would be able to match the poetic output of several thousand PTSD-ravaged veterans. “Within minutes of deployment, the Laureate-IV can assess the situation on the ground and draft plaintive lines about what it’s like to survive an IED ambush only to be left holding a 20-year-old’s intestines in as he bleeds out from a shrapnel wound, his dreams for life disappearing with the wind-blown desert sands.” “The result will be beautiful, hauntingly descriptive verse,” the executive added. According to Raytheon, the robot, which composes sublime poetry about being shipped off to an unfamiliar place and then told to kill strangers for reasons you don’t understand, has been outfitted with several features such as the continuous-track treads that will allow the machine to explore the smoldering craters left behind after bombs have hit a hospital or wedding party. Engineers confirmed the AI apparatus is equipped with 360-degree optical sensors that can pinpoint thousands of variables during a firefight and, from a distance of 600 meters, zoom in on a single tear running down the face of a traumatized, soot-covered child. The machine can then render this imagery in a very sparse, minimalist poem that evokes the emptiness and futility of war, company officials stated. “In the past, it would have been necessary to send entire battalions overseas with the hope that at least one surviving soldier would be able to portray the terrible chaos of urban warfare, the deafening blasts of aerial bombardments, and the ghastly screams of dying comrades in incredibly moving works of poetry,” said Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “But with this new technology, we can strategically deploy a handful of robots to deftly encapsulate in verse the existential despair that results from seeing a buddy survive dozens of combat missions and then die a random, meaningless death in a friendly fire accident just days before his tour was set to end.”  Added Dunford, “I look forward to reading these brilliantly desolate and disconsolate poems forged in the savage crucible of war.” Raytheon representatives acknowledged the company experimented with verse-composing computers during the Vietnam War, its earliest prototypes taking up entire warehouses, but the simplistic and often trite poetry they produced could not successfully depict the complex, ungraspable nature of war and ultimately failed to bear vital witness to that troubling conflict. In recent years, however, the robot’s developers have reportedly been able to employ modern neural networks to refine their systems and work out several bugs, such as the defect that caused the Laureate-I to fill page after page with nothing but the words “We are all pigs to the slaughter.” The engineers expressed hope of following their poetic success with a robot that can write 1,500-page epic novels that dramatize the disparate points of view of dozens of characters all experiencing the same horrific moments of combat. Officials from Raytheon confirmed they are also exploring commercial applications for the technology and may one day allow the public to purchase robots that write poems capturing the listless mundanity of civilian life.

"CORNUDAS, TX—In response to growing issues with its population of juvenile detainees, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reportedly announced on Tuesday the opening of a new supermax detention center to house its most hardened toddlers. “The Hudspeth County Maximum Correctional Facility is designed to provide secure and controlled incarceration of the most disruptive and difficult young children under ICE custody,” said ICE acting director Ronald Vitiello of the facility, which will hold up to 450 of the system’s most intractable and dangerous toddlers in single-cell solitary confinement for 23 hours per day, with minimal access to staff and other detained children, indefinitely. “These are the real criers and tantrum-throwers. We can’t put our guards at risk every day by allowing these kids who routinely incite mass screaming to remain among the general population. Look, a lot of these toddlers have been locked up for half their lives; they haven’t spent time in the outside world, and they have significant behavioral issues. We need to recognize that some of these truly hardened 12- to 36-month-old migrants are just beyond rehabilitation by our justice system.” Vitiello added that ICE was also hoping to expedite the reunification of parents and children who had been separated by the agency’s detention policies by updating the Leavenworth Detention Center with a family execution chamber.

"NEW YORK—Commending his healthy frame, impeccable lineage, and ability to form light and order from the primordial chaos, judges announced Thursday that Egyptian deity Ra has taken top honors at the 141st annual Westminster God Show. The purebred Egyptian sun god, who competed against divinities from more than 290 recognized pantheons—including Roman gods of war, trickster deities, and the Mesopotamian Anunnaki—reportedly overcame stiff competition to impress judges with high marks in gait, ear shape, and all-around omnipotence, ultimately winning best in show. “Since 1877, the Westminster God Show has conferred its highest award upon only the most distinguished of deities, and Ra is without question one of the finest specimens we’ve ever seen,” said judge Allison Brand, citing the distinguished pedigree of the 26,000-year-old creator of all life, who sired himself from the endless void and infinite night. “His victory is especially impressive when you consider this year’s incredibly competitive field. [Japanese storm god] Susanoo-no-Mikoto, for instance, really thrilled us when he rode the crest of a tsunami across the show floor and summoned the power of lightning to defeat the evil spirits of the world.” “But at the end of the day, Ra is just a tremendously pretty god,” she continued as she patted the deity’s falcon head and presented his handler with a purple-and-gold ribbon. Judges at the Westminster God Show, which takes place each year at Madison Square Garden, told reporters they subject deities to the highest levels of scrutiny, evaluating them on criteria that include miracle performance, disciple loyalty, and ability to herd souls into the afterlife. Officials noted that even small flaws can prove disastrous for a divine entrant, as was the case this year when Tezcatlipoca, Aztec god of the night sky, received low marks on his build after a judge’s inspection revealed his testicles were slightly mismatched. To avoid such pitfalls, handlers typically spend hours in the caged-off god-grooming area, where earlier this week they could be seen feeding hearts of the damned to Egyptian underworld goddess Ammit and rubbing coconut oil on four-armed Hindu god Ganesha to ensure he had a silky red coat for the show’s inspection portion. “For Ra to be crowned champion, several fan-favorite gods unfortunately had to lose,” said veteran Westminster announcer Nigel Masters, who described an incident in which the highly favored Kuba giant god Mbombo was disqualified after becoming sick and vomiting the sun, stars, and moon onto the artificial turf of the competition ring. “Many expected Hephaestus to win it all this year, but his maimed foot lost him serious points. In the end, he didn’t even place well in his own fire-god division.” According to historical records, the Westminster God Show has changed its rules of competition substantially over the years, most notably in 1938, when it relaxed its purebred restriction to include a demigod category. This reportedly led to the 1947 victory of Odin-sired Sæmingr and, more recently, a 1993 runner-up prize for the Lord Jesus Christ, who was said to have impressed judges with His even-keeled temperament and strong bite. Like most winners before him, Ra is expected to move on to a lucrative career in studding, unless, like 2015 best-in-show recipient Uranus, he is castrated with a sickle and has his genitals thrown into the sea. “From the first time I saw Ra weep, his tears falling to the earth to create humanity itself, I knew he was something special, but this is truly a great honor,” said 57-year-old Gerald Simons, the sun god’s longtime handler. “It’s been extraordinary to watch him come up from the literal vast expanse of nothingness to form the land, the sky, and the underworld. He’s a very good god. Yes, he is!” “Somebody deserves a treat,” he added as he pet the solar disk floating above Ra’s head and gestured toward a sacrificial bull in a nearby handling crate. At press time, sources reported that the remainder of the award ceremony had been delayed after Jörmungandr, winner of this year’s top serpent-god accolades, slipped free from his leash and destroyed all of existence.

"MESA, AZ—Disgusted by the gross misuse of resources, concerned citizen and self-described patriot Andrew Beardsley voiced his anger Thursday concerning the thousands of refugee children currently occupying prison cells that could be used to incarcerate real Americans. “It makes me sick to think of these freeloading kids coming here by the thousands, living in 10-by-10 cells on the taxpayer’s dime while honest-to-God American citizens could be suffering behind those bars,” said Beardsley, adding that he sees no reason why the 3-to-13-year-old detainees could not simply go through the proper immigration process and be mistreated as American prisoners. “I don’t want my tax dollars paying for some Mexican kid who comes here and takes three square feet of American jail cell—three square feet that could be used to house a young U.S. citizen from the inner city. There are children born here on American soil who deserve to be locked up, but they are being denied that experience because these refugees are taking their place. Hell, they’re not even being forced to work under inhumane conditions while they’re there.” Beardsley also rejected as “liberal bullcrap” the idea that South and Central American refugee children were merely doing the prison time that American children don’t want to do.

"WASHINGTON—Logging countless hours in the Oval Office between warmly greeting foreign diplomats, an unusually serene and well-spoken President Trump was hard at work Thursday, industriously shepherding environmental and civil rights bills through Congress just days after a freak accident left a railroad spike lodged into his skull. “President Trump has been a model of professionalism ever since the accident—he’s attentive and inquisitive during intelligence briefings, articulate at press conferences, and his tweets have been increasingly vetted and thoroughly researched,” said White House chief of staff John Kelly, echoing the general sentiments of staffers in the West Wing, where feelings of general relief and a newfound sense of job security were observed during the two-hour morning meeting Trump convened to discuss naming Ada Limón the new U.S. poet laureate. “At first I was a bit concerned, as anyone would be when a railroad spike pierces a sitting president’s cerebral cortex and bisects his hypothalamus, but the White House physician checked him out and concluded that the benign effect on Trump’s disposition outweighs any possible long-term harm.” At press time, staffers confirmed Trump was growing morose and irritable after banging the protruding head of the spike on the doorframe of Air Force One while attempting to deplane.

"THE HEAVENS—Feeling unnerved after sensing a sudden movement in His peripheral vision, an increasingly jumpy God, Our Heavenly Father, was reportedly starting to worry Monday that Heaven may be haunted. “No, seriously, this is not okay—I’m really freaking the fuck out here,” said the Lord Almighty, adding that He was becoming more and more sure that the hazy, ghost-like apparitions lurking behind clouds were of paranormal origin. “Every so often, I get this cold shudder and it’s just, like, there’s someone there, you know? The angels tell me it’s all in my head, but I swear I’m telling the truth. I obviously don’t believe in all that afterlife stuff, but it’s starting to feel like there’s no other explanation besides that this place is haunted.” At press time, God had shrieked in alarm after catching a glimpse of a shadowy figure that bore a stark resemblance to His son, who had been dead more than 2,000 years.

"ST. MUCUS—Expressing concern that the team might choose to relocate if a deal were not struck by the end of the offseason, Mutant Hockey League officials were reportedly pessimistic Friday that the owners of the St. Mucus Ooze would reach an agreement with the city to publicly finance a new arena. The Ooze, one of the oldest franchises in the Toxic Conference, have reportedly been trying for months to negotiate a deal to replace the aging St. Mucus Arena in time for the 2019 MHL season. According to league insiders, city officials have been reluctant to fund construction of a modern facility that would offer expanded seating for the team’s troll, skeleton, and robot fan base. “We’re still hoping both parties will reach a compromise, but at this point it’s hard to see the city footing the bill for a giant slug to resurface the ice between periods, much less a whole new venue,” said an anonymous MHL executive, adding that a new arena was necessary to help St. Mucus stay competitive with larger hockey markets such as Slay City. “It’s obviously a huge project for the city to take on, but at the same time, the Ooze are part of St. Mucus history. Every kid who grows up there has that iconic Britt Skull jersey.” “All you have to do is compare St. Mucus Arena to Madness Square Garden or the Pucksucker Pukes’ brand-new Puke Palace and it’s obvious the facilities are very outdated,” the executive added. Team owners, who noted the wear and tear that the Ooze’s current home has endured from decades of exploding pucks and chainsaws thrown onto the ice by enthusiastic fans, also stressed that St. Mucus Arena’s poor sightlines and inadequate lighting deprive spectators of the best possible view of every powerplay, shootout, and game-changing dismemberment. However, city leaders have continued to push back against the cost of installing new demon nets, even after the team threatened a possible move to join the Cadavers in Montroyale if their demands were not met. According to sources, a proposed compromise to simply update St. Mucus Arena with modern amenities like fire pits, landmines, and ice sharks fell apart in early talks. “This place has seen some of the greatest moments in Mutant Hockey League history, from Maim Zitsky’s record-breaking 74th playoff kill, to Steve Yzergone becoming the first player to decapitate an entire opposing team,” said the Ooze’s coach Scary, adding that St. Mucus Arena was just as synonymous with the Ooze as the Skunk Centre was with the Terminator Trolz. “But if fans want to keep the Ooze in St. Mucus, the team needs to be able to keep attracting top-tier talent—the Mario Lepuke’s and TORO-3000’s of tomorrow. And that’s not going to happen with a 30-year-old arena.”  “I mean, could you even imagine hosting the Monster Cup Championship here?” added Scary.

"WASHINGTON—Frustrated by what she called “obvious misconceptions” related to the Trump administration’s detention of thousands of migrant children who have been forcibly separated from their parents, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reminded journalists Friday that children under the age of 14 are unable to experience pain. “Look, no matter how much phony controversy the Democrats generate, it’s a simple fact that illegal alien criminals this young are still developing the part of the brain that feels pain, goes through emotional trauma, and retains memories,” said Sanders, explaining that while migrant children may appear to be crying, screaming, or begging for their parents, they are merely attempting to mimic actions they have observed in regular humans. “Furthermore, it’s important to keep in mind that we are talking about foreign children—even if they somehow manage to see their families again, environmental factors may prevent them from developing the capacity to even recognize them. I mean, they live in cages, for God’s sake.” Huckabee Sanders further noted that, were the children to actually receive the sort of care and attention necessary to develop minds and bodies capable of experiencing the pain of what they are currently going through, they would only have the child welfare policies of the Obama administration to blame.

It’s pretty cool, and there’s enough stuff going on that I hardly ever think about getting back on a speedboat.” God went on to say that adjusting to heaven had been relatively easy since his good friend Dave had arrived mere seconds after He did.

"MCALLEN, TX—Expressing frustration with the migrant child’s sense of entitlement, ICE authorities confirmed Monday that picky Honduran refugee Blanca Diaz just expected to be reunited with the exact same family she had before. “We’re already letting you go, and now you think you deserve special treatment and will just be automatically paired with whichever parents you want? Jesus, there’s just no pleasing some people,” said ICE agent Patrick Buecker of the 5-year-old girl who, after being forcibly separated from her parents and sisters at the border, was now “making such a huge deal” about the precise names, ages, and nationalities of the family members with whom she wished to rejoin. “We gave her a perfectly good mother and father and some siblings.

Must have been 4 feet 2 inches, 85 pounds at least—so you know he commanded respect. Thank God he went down easy with a couple pops and a blow from a nightstick.

"WASHINGTON—Saying that the charitable contribution would immediately provide a clear conscience, experts reported Friday that you need to donate $37 to hurricane relief in order to completely forget about what happened. “Concerned individuals have been asking what they can do to stop feeling bad about hurricane victims, so everyone should know that a $37 donation is sufficient to allow you to move on from the disaster once and for all,” said nonprofit analyst Sandra Western, adding that a donation in that amount entitles the giver to avoid any further media coverage of the hurricane and not feel any kind of shame about the degree to which they were helping. “You can donate $25, but the notion that you could have done more might nag at you for a bit. At $37, however, you’ll be able to tell yourself you pitched in when some truly desperate people needed you most and then never think about them again. In addition, if you donate $65 or more, you can also sit out the next catastrophe with no guilt whatsoever.” Western went on to say that the guidelines did not apply to selfish assholes, who could donate nothing and immediately forget the devastation anyway.

"BETHESDA, MD—Explaining that a sudden decrease in pressure could have long-term negative effects on the human body, experts at the National Institutes of Health warned Monday that transitioning too quickly from work to vacation could cause decompression sickness. “After spending a lengthy amount of time in a high-pressure environment, suddenly kicking back without acclimating to the new low-pressure conditions can cause tension in the body to rapidly release and lead to a number of debilitating symptoms,” said NIH researcher Gale Dickson, noting that vacationers who unwind too fast often experience joint pain, dizziness, paralysis, and, in severe cases, even death. “We recommend taking a few days to ease into a restful state by answering a few work emails every couple of hours or breaking up short stints of going to the beach and sitting in front of the television by doing some paperwork. Even just thinking about work as you get more comfortable can maintain a safe level of ambient pressure until your body reaches equilibrium.” Dickson confirmed that after a week of gradual decompression, one should then begin the reverse process in order to avoid any negative effects of abrupt recompression upon returning to work.

"WASHINGTON—Shedding light on how the nation managed its wealth, a study released Thursday by the Pew Research Center revealed that Americans conduct the vast majority of their financial planning when figuring out how to get their money’s worth at an all-you-can-eat buffet. “Our data show that Americans devote the greatest amount of attention to allocating their resources when determining how much value they can wring from the offerings at their local Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral,” said lead researcher Michelle Keene, noting that more than half the study’s participants indicated they would head immediately for big-ticket items like the roast beef, ham, or fried chicken, while approximately 30 percent opted to arrive just as breakfast transitioned to lunch in an effort to enjoy two meals at once. “Whether individuals concoct a plan to refrain from eating anything too heavy several hours before arriving, or only order water so as to avoid the empty calories of a soda, the average American shows an unprecedented level of foresight and long-term thinking while heaping their plate with the most expensive meat and seafood.” Keene cautioned that the research did uncover anomalies, noting that the vast majority of Americans abandoned any notion of stretching their dollar upon encountering a steaming-hot tray of fresh waffle fries.

"MINNEAPOLIS—Struggling to fathom why no one has yet claimed the perfectly good piece of furniture, local man Adam Ellery told reporters Wednesday that a free couch has been sitting on the curb near his apartment for months. The couch, a 6-foot-long settee made of solid redwood drilled into cast-iron supports, has reportedly remained out on the pavement since Ellery moved to the neighborhood nearly a year ago. “I can’t believe no one’s snagged it yet,” said Ellery, observing that the couch is in solid shape and appears to have no major damage or stains. “It looks kind of heavy, but if you could get a friend with a truck to help, it wouldn’t be too hard to move. Then all you’d have to do is give it a quick wipe down, maybe buy a cover for it, and boom, you’ve got yourself a great addition to your living room.” “It’s definitely on the firm side, but it looks like it has great back support and sturdy construction,” he continued. “I don’t see any sagging at all.” Describing the couch as a vintage piece that features fashionably distressed lumber and aged, rusty screws, Ellery remarked that he grows increasingly bewildered each time he walks by and sees it is still there. According to the 30-year-old digital media manager, passersby frequently stop to try out the couch, often sitting on it for a while as they read a newspaper or eat their lunch. But in each case, he said, the person stands up within a half hour or so and continues on his or her way, mysteriously passing up the chance to take home some high-quality seating at absolutely no cost. “This thing had to be really expensive when it was new, and it’s just sitting there, completely free for the taking,” said Ellery, who noted that while he has not sat on the couch himself, he once saw a man lying down on it and sleeping soundly, so he assumes it is comfortable. “The first time I saw it, I wasn’t expecting it to be around very long, but it’s somehow remained up for grabs on the side of the road this whole time. I mean, call me crazy, but when I see a golden opportunity like that, I take it.” “Honestly, I’m beginning to question why someone would even throw away a couch so nice in the first place,” he added. Ellery went on to state that given how long the couch has been out there on the sidewalk, he is surprised no one from city services has been sent to pick it up and dispose of it, especially considering how tidy and well-maintained the rest of his neighborhood is. While remarking that he is glad the couch hasn’t yet gone to waste, he expressed concern that if someone doesn’t “scoop it up quick,” it could get rained upon and ruined. “Whoever threw out that couch also threw out a pretty nice 15-foot floor lamp and a large heavy-duty steel wastebasket, both of which seem like they’d be rare and hard to find at furniture stores,” said Ellery, speculating that the three items might once have been sold together as a set. “I told some of my friends about the couch and posted a photo of it on my neighborhood’s Facebook page, but no one was interested. Their loss, if you ask me. You could probably sit four, maybe five people on that thing.” “God, it’s crazy how wasteful people can be,” he continued. Ellery added that he would gladly take the couch home himself, but he already has two exactly like it. ",1,Free Couch Sitting On Curb For Months
"BANGOR, ME—Admitting their investigation was at a standstill, local law enforcement officials told reporters Wednesday they had enlisted the help of bestselling author Stephen King to track down a demonic automobile accused of killing an area woman. Authorities made the decision to contact the award-winning writer after failing to develop any significant leads in the case, according to a spokesperson for the Bangor Police Department. Though they say the 70-year-old’s often arrogant and prickly demeanor makes him difficult to work with, detectives confirmed they are hoping King’s specialized insight will help them locate the bloodthirsty and allegedly homicidal vehicle. “Let me guess: It looks like a classic hit-and-run, but the car that mowed her down didn’t leave a trace of physical evidence,” King said as he arrived at the crime scene, lifting the caution tape with his cane and hobbling toward a group of officers. “The victim has a boyfriend, but you already talked to him, and he’s got an airtight alibi for the night in question and no record of criminal history. So you’ve got no means, no motive, and no opportunity—all of which means you’re screwed, even before you take into account the fact that you’re dealing with the insatiable appetite for murder that inhabits the souls of the damned.” “I take it from the stupid blank looks on everyone’s faces that I’m right so far,” he added. Openly scoffing at the detectives’ working theory that a shape-shifting poltergeist had assumed the form of a car, King reportedly explained to officers that the clinical efficiency of the attack suggested instead a corporeal vehicle possessed by the soul of a serial killer. Bangor police chief Alex Ingraham acknowledged that the celebrated novelist and longtime Maine resident has assisted with a number of high-profile cases over the years, including one in which a telekinetic teenager destroyed a local high school gym and another in which a bloodsucking undead being and his elderly caretaker conspired to turn all the residents of a nearby town into vampires. Sources said that while inspecting the scene of the hit-and-run, King cleared away some brush near a bend in the road and revealed a tire tread the forensics team had overlooked. “These tracks were made by Firestone whitewalls, and considering how long ago those went out of fashion, I’d say we’re looking for a vintage automobile being driven by the deranged ghost of its former owner,” King said to the investigators gathering around him. “Now that this entity has gotten a taste for blood, it’s going to start seeking revenge on anyone it feels may have wronged it. That means the clock’s ticking if we want to prevent another murder.” “Start pulling files on any unusual or mysterious deaths that took place in a car 60 or 70 years ago,” he continued. “And put out an APB for anyone driving a Plymouth Fury or an antique Buick Roadmaster who appears agitated and is dressed like a 1950s-era greaser.” While Ingraham has said he appreciates King’s uncanny ability to get inside the head of unknowably dark and malevolent forces to reconstruct the events at a crime scene, the police chief has privately expressed concern that prolonged exposure to the blood-soaked handiwork of evil spirits has taken an emotional toll on the author. Sources close to King have stated that his gruff exterior is a façade that masks a sensitive persona still racked with guilt by the one crime he was never able to solve: The grisly stabbing deaths of a family serving as caretakers for a haunted ski lodge. “I’m only going to say this once, so try to get it through that thick skull of yours,” King said to a lieutenant after being informed that a search of the police database hadn’t yielded any results for the car in question. “The vengeful specter inhabiting this old car will have transformed the vehicle back to its brand-new, original state, so unless you’re running plates from the Eisenhower administration, nothing’s going to show up.” “Now while I’m over here doing your job and actually stopping people from getting murdered by a four-wheeled demon, why don’t you make yourself useful and grab me a cup of coffee?” he added. At press time, after learning the suspected vehicle had last been registered to one Randall Flagg, an ashen-faced King was overheard mumbling to himself that all his past cases might somehow be connected.

"WASHINGTON—Assuring the public that the decision was difficult but the right thing to do for all parties involved, the Smithsonian National Zoological Park announced Friday that their giant pandas would be divorcing. “After a lot of soul-searching and honest, often painful, discussions, we are sad to say that our two giant pandas, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, will be seeking a divorce,” said Michael Brown-Palsgrove, curator of the zoo’s Asia Trails and Giant Pandas section, adding that the couple had been sleeping on opposite sides of their enclosure for the past few months, a rift sources suggested was fueled in part by Tian Tian’s reluctance to have another cub. “For the time being, Tian Tian will be crashing on the rock outcropping in the enclosure of his friend Remi, a sloth bear, until he can find a more permanent place to stay. Although there’s much to be sorted out in terms of feeding schedules, what’s important now is that we focus on making this an easy transition for 2-year-old Bei Bei, over whom the pandas will share joint custody.” Brown-Palsgrove went on to say that in order to respect their privacy during this difficult time, the 24-hour panda cam will be turned off.

"LOUISVILLE, KY—Baffling fast food consumers nationwide by implicating the diners themselves in some unknown but vaguely fishery-related practice, seafood chain Long John Silver’s launched a new nationwide ad campaign Tuesday featuring the cryptic tagline “You Are The Bait Now.” “I’ve seen a commercial that was nothing more than a tracking shot of a guy walking down a dark alleyway with no context whatsoever. I don’t know what they were going for, but they certainly didn’t mention any seafood,” said local computer technician Megan Berger, who also recalled seeing a billboard of a woman sitting alone in a dimly lit restaurant, light gleaming dully from her moist and hooded eyes. “I figured they’d eventually offer me a deal on a fish combo or something, but it just faded to black while a menacing voice-over said ‘while supplies last.’” Representatives from Long John Silver’s have thus far declined to comment when asked about the ads or the ingredients of their new hand-battered three-piece family.

"AUSTIN, TX—In an investigation of the phenomenon’s tendency to occur during barroom brawls, a report published Thursday concluded that 83 percent of cases in which a player piano spontaneously begins to play were on account of a couple local ruffians went and got themselves into a gunfight. A team at the University of Texas analyzed data from saloons, watering holes, and brothels across the western frontier and found 428 instances in which, right after some no-good rascal had shot off his Colt .45, a self-playing piano began hammering out a spirited rendition of “Oh! Susanna.” The report stated that the majority of these cases resulted when disputations between two ol’ scoundrels got out of hand, causing guns to be drawn and starting an all-out tussle that darn near wrecked the entire premises.  “Our findings indicate that roughly four out of every five player pianos are set off by a stray bullet, either when a notorious outlaw is finally cornered by a young gun, or when pistols are fired in a bordello following a quarrel over a kindhearted prostitute,” said the report’s lead author, Marina Fuller, noting that in most cases the piano continued to play right up to the moment the sheriff arrived and fired his gun into the air, putting a stop to the whole ruckus. “We also observed quite a few cases in which, as soon as the player piano started up, a grizzled old-timer who had been asleep in the corner jerked awake and began to pick out a rollicking accompaniment on his banjo.” She added, “Even in cases when a bullet ricocheted off the bar before shattering some unsuspecting fellow’s whiskey glass mid-sip, it usually set off the player piano along the way.” According to the report, an additional 11 percent of player pianos began playing when some lucky prospector who had just struck it rich got hit over the head with a jug of wine, fell off the second-story balustrade, and landed on the instrument, while another 6 percent started up when a fancy man from back East was thrown down the full length of the bar, smashing into every beer mug along the way and flying headlong into the piano.  Researchers confirmed that in approximately a third of these fights, a bullet went through a huge barrel labeled “XXX,” causing moonshine to pour directly into the mouth of the town drunk, who had staggered in and passed out near the bar. In nearly every instance, the dusty old piano reportedly began to play even faster as the gunfight escalated. “Interestingly, we noticed these pianos will cease playing immediately—right in the middle of the song—if at any point during the shootout a famed gunslinger rumored to have died steps into the bar and causes the stunned brawlers to stop dead in their tracks,” Fuller said. “Otherwise, these altercations tend to continue until all the furniture in the saloon has been broken over someone’s head and the entire melee has poured out onto the street.” “These types of scuffles can even spill over into the Women’s Temperance League meeting going on next door, forcing the ladies in attendance to fan themselves and run out of the building,” she continued. The report stressed that the best way to stay safe during such gunfights is to jump inside a barrel to hide, though it also warned that if a man pokes his head out to see what’s going on, he’s liable to get his hat shot clean off the top of his dang noggin.

"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the publication of such a brief, tantalizing bit of audio was a breach of their journalistic responsibility, a furious Stephen Miller told reporters Tuesday that he was outraged at ProPublica for only releasing seven minutes of immigrant children sobbing. “It’s unacceptable that this so-called news organization saw fit to foist this total tease of a clip on the American public,” said Miller, who expressed frustration that the audio, in which 10 detained Central American children can be heard crying out for their parents, ended before reaching “the really good stuff.” “Sure, they’re wailing ‘Mami’ and ‘Papa’ so hard they can’t breathe, and I guess the part where that 6-year-old desperately rattles off her aunt’s phone number is kind of satisfying, but ultimately it only conveys a very small fraction of what we’re doing here. I’ve listened to this recording dozens and dozens of times in the past day, and it’s just simply nowhere near enough to scratch the itch. Shame on you, ProPublica.” Miller added that the one silver lining was the likelihood that other outlets would soon broadcast hours of comprehensive, high-quality footage of immigrant children being tormented.

"SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR—Praising U.S. law enforcement officials for the unfettered cruelty they have unleashed along the Mexican border, MS-13 gang leader Edwin Manica Flores admitted Tuesday that observing ICE’s work in recent weeks has provided him with quite a bit of inspiration. “Seriously, we would have never thought of keeping kids in a cage like that—in fact, that’s kind of off-limits for us—but you can’t deny the genius behind it,” said Manica Flores, observing that when one of these children or parents goes on to commit suicide out of sheer grief, federal authorities won’t even be held criminally liable for the death. “Sure, we have our fair share of evil tactics, but that ICE shit is next-level brilliant. I guess we can’t beat ourselves up too much, though, considering those guys have one of the most powerful governments in the world backing them. I’d love to meet one of those ICE motherfuckers, just to pick his brain a little, you know? We may force 9-year-olds to join MS-13, but the United States is putting them in cages like wild animals. That’s straight savage!” Manica Flores went on to suggest that if his men were half as nasty as ICE, they would control 100 percent of U.S. drug trafficking within weeks.

"WASHINGTON—In response to criticism of the Justice Department’s “zero tolerance” policy stripping migrant children away from their parents and placing them in detention centers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued Monday that family separations are only happening because current law doesn’t allow him to strangle immigrants with his bare hands. “Simply put, I am forced to tear kids away from their parents, because I am legally prohibited from throttling immigrants until their bodies go limp,” said Sessions, asserting that the practice of locking children away in cages and deporting their parents before they can be reunited would be reversed as soon as the law was updated to permit the attorney general to press his thumbs deep into migrants’ windpipes as he watches the life fade from their eyes. “Look, I want to see these poor immigrants dead as much as the next guy, but it’s simply out of my control. I agree that it’s a huge tragedy that I cannot snuff the life out of these migrants together as entire families, but I have a moral duty to follow the law as written.” At press time, Sessions called on Democrats to stop their obstructionist tactics and pass legislation granting him the ability to pin down each individual in the immigrant families and suffocate them one by one.

"LOS ANGELES—According to terrified witnesses, the whole boardroom of Capstone Marketing Insights began to quake violently Friday as CEO Matt Petersen’s eyes turned an inky black and his voice dropped an octave while announcing a new, video-centered vision for the company. Calling it a “necessary pivot” and “an exciting opportunity to grow profits,” Petersen reportedly started writing out quarterly projections at an inhuman speed and then emitted an ear-splitting screech that caused each of the frosted glass panels enclosing the conference room to shatter in horrifying succession. Sources confirmed the room temperature fell by more than 20 degrees as the CEO spoke, the air taking on a noxious, sulfuric scent when he proclaimed—with several deep, boar-like grunts—that the company would also be partnering with a third-party social-media consulting firm. Moments later, all nine members of the board reportedly started nodding their heads uncontrollably and then vomited a thick, blood-speckled bile to signal their unanimous support.

"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the administration’s policy was rooted in a clear moral authority, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly defended separating immigrant families Friday by citing his senate confirmation vote. “I would remind anyone concerned about the ethics of removing asylum-seekers from their children that I sailed through my confirmation hearing with a vote of 52-47,” said Sessions, quoting at length from a transcript of his testimony in which his history of racially charged remarks and actions were discussed in detail. “We’re not just talking about immigration hardliners here, either—Dean Heller, John McCain, Susan Collins, and even Joe Manchin all gave me their endorsement. These senators were certainly aware of what actions I was likely to take as Attorney General, so why would they have decided to confirm me if these policies were unjust? The relative smoothness of my hearing proves that we are on the correct and righteous course.” Sessions also cited the continued lack of impeachment proceedings against him as a sound justification for eventually rolling back the rights of legal immigrants who have lived in the country for decades.  ",1,Sessions Defends Separating Immigrant Families By Citing Senate Confirmation Vote

Heck, even murder is understandable in the right circumstances, but what Bulger did, that’s just unconscionable.

"WASHINGTON—Standing up to the government agency in a blistering essay published in the  , former First Lady Laura Bush wrote a courageous op-ed Monday calling for the imprisonment of whoever created ICE. “Separating children from their parents is an unconscionable moral tragedy, and everyone involved should be held accountable, specifically whatever monster is responsible for bringing this criminal agency into existence,” wrote Bush in the op-ed, adding that there was nothing in ICE’s 15-year history to suggest that separating families and imprisoning children in cages was in any way a deviation from the agency’s intended purpose, and any official who says otherwise is either a liar or an idiot. “Whoever is responsible for this atrocity should be tried in the Hague and punished to the fullest extent of international law. Look, ICE was obviously intended to be a punitive, discriminatory organization—it’s under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, for fuck’s sake. It’s a stain on America’s record. I ask you to join me in calling for whoever established this agency to be thrown into prison to rot. Fuck them.” Bush’s op-ed comes on the heels of fellow former First Lady Michelle Obama’s recent piece in the   demanding full prosecution of whatever morally bankrupt political official permitted ICE to continue growing increasingly unaccountable and sadistic throughout the early 2010s.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the financial risks and hours of hard work would pay off in the long term, former president Barack Obama revealed Thursday that he has sunk his entire life’s savings into the development of a tabletop game based on the American presidency. Obama confirmed that over the past 10 months, he has spent the bulk of his family’s net worth to create  , a hybrid role-playing and board game about running a presidential administration. He has reportedly devised more than 50 possible storylines players may encounter while they work together to complete a term in the Oval Office, planning fiscally sound federal budgets, negotiating trade deals with foreign countries, and delivering aid to states struck by natural disasters. “Once   hits the market, it’s gonna blow up just like   did, but right now funding is the biggest issue,” said Obama, sitting at his dining room table and showing off a prototype that included a 4-by-4 foot game board, stacks of handwritten index cards labeled “event” and “item,” and a set of polyhedral dice. “I drained our bank account to pay this specialty manufacturer to make the game components, and I’m hoping the Kickstarter money will cover the cost of renting warehouse space to store the finished product.” “I had to dip into Sasha’s college fund, so she may have to go to state school her first couple years,” the 44th president of the United States continued. “But once the game takes off and starts making money, she can transfer wherever she wants.” The former president described the game as “a fully immersive executive-branch adventure for players 12 and up” and said it has a playing time of approximately 20 hours. According to Obama, one player acts as the president, leading the administration through various challenges, while the other players work together as vice president, chief of staff, and various cabinet secretaries to implement policy initiatives and maintain the day-to-day agenda of the West Wing. Players reportedly must complete several side quests to keep the White House running, such as seeking Senate confirmations, hosting state dinners, and holding press conferences following national events such as mass shootings or holiday celebrations. Obama estimated that   will sell for around $60 and will come with character sheets for players to track their stats, a 200-page hardcover “President’s Policy Guide” rulebook, and 15 pewter game pieces that include miniature replicas of the presidential seal, the   desk, a manila briefing folder, and Uncle Sam. “[Former first lady] Michelle [Obama] has really been on my case lately about having this stuff all over the dining room,” Obama said as he scribbled an idea for a Camp David expansion pack on one of the large whiteboards he had mounted on the walls. “But she doesn’t understand how much money we have tied up in this thing. I took out a second mortgage on the house, and with the funds from that I should be able to get a booth at the next PAX gaming convention.” “Once people see how fun it is to craft and deliver their very own 90-minute State of the Union address covering every major issue in politics, they’re going to want to buy this,” he added, flipping through a legal pad filled with the game’s rules for appointing federal circuit judges. Obama admitted that he spends nearly all his free time working on  , often staying up until three or four in the morning drawing character art of suit-and-tie-wearing politicians and consulting online forums for advice on game mechanics, action-selection methods, and victory conditions. “I convinced Malia to beta-test it with me when she was home from school last weekend, but she said it wasn’t her thing,” Obama said. “We only made it to the midterm elections before her secretary of state character’s approval rating fell below 25 percent, knocking her out of the game. I got so into it I completely forgot about a speech I was supposed to give at Michelle’s Let Girls Learn event.” “She was pretty steamed, but once the orders start rolling in, she’ll see it was all worth it,” he added. At press time, Obama had reportedly dropped to his knees and begun shouting at former first dogs Bo and Sunny for shredding the game’s board and swallowing all its handmade playing pieces.

"ALBUQUERQUE, NM—Concerned that the span of unemployment on his résumé could be a liability during an upcoming job interview, local man Erik Hunt said Wednesday that he desperately hopes he isn’t asked about the two years he was out of the workforce because he was abducted by aliens. The 34-year-old job applicant, who appeared visibly nervous as he waited in the lobby of digital marketing firm Everhart Media, told reporters he hopes the interviewer inquires about his relevant experience, skills, and education rather than focusing on the gap in his work history that resulted from an eerie white light transporting him from a fishing boat on Cochiti Lake to the laboratory of a giant spacecraft, where he spent 24 months as the subject of alien medical experiments. “I can just see the hiring manager getting to those missing years on my résumé and hitting me with all kinds of questions about what I was up to,” said Hunt, who acknowledged that he dreaded having to explain how he was kidnapped by a highly advanced alien lifeform in June 2014, shuttled across the galaxy at the speed of light, and then abruptly returned home in May 2016. “It’s my track record of success in marketing that should count most, right? The fact that I was held in suspended animation while a team of 7-foot humanoids operated on my digestive tract has virtually nothing to do with the associate brand manager position.” “Honestly, I just wish they’d skip over it altogether,” he added. Hunt, who stressed that he wouldn’t feel comfortable lying outright to potential employers, said he hoped he could gloss over things by alluding to time spent freelancing independently and then changing the subject. However, if the interviewer were to ask any follow-up questions or request references who could confirm he was continuously employed during the two-year period, Hunt confirmed he would be at a complete loss, having no way to provide any contact information whatsoever for Commander Zerpolax. The digital marketing professional noted that he had extensively reformatted his résumé—adding a paragraph-long statement of purpose and lengthy descriptions of projects he had spearheaded—in the hope of drawing attention away from the interruption in his employment history, which during an interview last month forced him to provide detailed explanations of merging his consciousness with that of an unfathomable being from a distant nebula instead of focusing on his key professional qualifications. “The frustrating thing is that my level of experience should make me a shoo-in for this position,” said Hunt, who added that his decade of developing relationships with clients and building a strong portfolio of brand-facing creative campaigns ought to be given more weight than the year he was on display in a human zoo in the Alpha Centauri system. “It’s really going to suck if they end up picking someone totally unqualified just because the six months I spent learning how to use a smuggled laser blaster so I could fight my way to the mothership’s escape hatch gives me a less conventional CV.” “Maybe my best bet is to try to spin the whole thing into a positive,” Hunt continued. “If I can focus on how having excruciatingly painful incisions made to my vital organs while I remained conscious was a character-building experience, that might actually give me a leg up.” Hunt went on to state that until he was hired, he would avoid mentioning to interviewers the hybrid human-alien embryo that is gestating inside him and will explode from his skull in a few months.

"PHILADELPHIA—Convinced they will win the highly competitive contest to host the e-commerce giant’s new offices, optimistic local officials have preemptively razed Philadelphia’s entire Center City district to make room for Amazon’s second North American headquarters, sources said Thursday.  According to the mayor’s office, the decision to completely level the downtown region was reached as city leaders became increasingly confident that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos would eventually come to realize Philadelphia was the best of the 238 localities across the United States, Mexico, and Canada bidding to become the online retailer’s new center of operations. Over the past few weeks, city employees have reportedly worked around the clock to relocate the area’s more than 57,000 residents, while demolition crews have knocked down thousands of homes, businesses, and cultural sites.  “After taking a look at the competition and figuring we probably have this thing in the bag, we just went ahead and tore down Center City so Amazon can move right in,” said Mayor Jim Kenney, noting that destroying Philadelphia’s central business district was “an easy call” and that he was proud of the city’s campaign to woo the company with promotional videos, full-page newspaper ads, and endorsements from state politicians and local celebrities. “We look forward to all the jobs and economic benefits that will be coming our way once Amazon decides to call what used to be Center City home.” “Between Philadelphia’s great transit system, its reasonable cost of living, and the fact that there are now two square miles of completely open space in the heart of the city, I can’t see any reason why they wouldn’t want to come here,” he added. Kenney showed reporters an interactive mockup of what Amazon’s campus might look like, with new roads crisscrossing the former Rittenhouse Square to service numerous office towers. He said it would be hard for the company to turn down a bid that would allow it to construct its own modern, business-friendly environment on the vacated sites of more than a dozen historic neighborhoods, including Penn’s Landing, Logan Square, and Society Hill. The mayor went on to observe that Amazon would have a unique opportunity to put its own mark on the city now that the Inquirer Building, the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, and Love Park have all been bulldozed. “It was definitely bittersweet saying goodbye to the Liberty Bell before our controlled demolition of Independence Hall, but it’s important we encourage businesses to invest in the city,” said Kenney, adding that his office was also evicting 100,000 Philadelphia residents living outside of Center City in order to give relocating Amazon employees access to homes and schools in the most desirable neighborhoods. “Philadelphians should rest assured, however, that we will work to preserve access to our beloved city’s historic legacy. We may even use revenue from the expanded tax base Amazon will provide to help build a high-speed rail service running to the area 30 miles south of town where all our art museums and hospitals are now located.” “We’re willing to do whatever it takes to ensure Amazon chooses Philadelphia, whether that requires tax incentives, infrastructure upgrades, or filling the Schuylkill River with concrete to create more parking,” he continued. “I’m sure it’s just a matter of time until it’s all official.” At press time, Amazon officials announced that Philadelphia had failed to qualify for the next round of bidding.

"WASHINGTON—Investigating a sudden uptick in nationwide on-the-job somnolence, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration released a study Monday showing that the majority of late afternoon sleepiness in the American workplace is in fact caused by an undetected carbon monoxide leak. “Our investigations found that a lack of focus, weariness, or general disinclination to perform at a job after normal lunch hours is most likely a sign that an employee is breathing in colorless, odorless, noxious fumes,” said lead researcher Mario Garrison, noting that over half the people who are feeling any kind of exhaustion or sluggishness at their place of employment between the hours of noon and 3 p.m. are being slowly poisoned at their desks or workstations. “Employees who become sleepy and close their eyes during the afternoon are in danger of never opening them again. The buildup of gas can be slow, as carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air, so it may go unnoticed the entire morning. But make no mistake: From your first workplace yawn, you could be dead within an hour.” Garrison suggested that anyone who was feeling even the slightest bit tired in the afternoon hours at their place of employment should take the rest of the day off.

"WASHINGTON—Noting aspects of the job he enjoyed as well as offering what he hoped would be helpful criticism, Barack Obama reportedly filled out a lukewarm review of the presidency on the employer review website Glassdoor a few days after exiting the position last Friday. “In terms of pros, you get to travel a lot and there’s lots of free food—also super dog-friendly,” wrote the 44th commander-in-chief in an anonymous three-star review, selecting the box for “former” employee and choosing “full-time” from the employment status drop-down menu. “In terms of cons, though, the hours are terrible for your work-life balance, and it’s often hard to get anything done because there’s so much red tape, not to mention all the cliques and office politics (frankly, lots of asshole coworkers). All kinds of responsibility but very little recognition for accomplishments, which definitely starts to wear on you. I ultimately don’t think I’d recommend this job to others.” At press time, other Glassdoor users noted that the unnamed person who wrote the review seemed to have a much harder time than the previous position holder, who described the job as “usually tons of fun.” ",1,Obama Fills Out Lukewarm Glassdoor Review After Exiting Presidency
"WASHINGTON—With sofa cushions duct-taped to their chests as they marched into the meeting, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly interrupted a military intelligence briefing Friday, shouting “ten-hut!” in unison and then volunteering to fight in North Korea.   According to sources, Defense Secretary James Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were reviewing a presentation on troop mobility in Afghanistan when the Trump boys, who wore rain boots and had secured throw pillows to their legs and arms with belts, burst into the White House Situation Room to announce they had trained for an entire day and were ready to deploy to North Korea to “kill King Jong-un.”   “We did all the basic training and now we can do combat stuff!” said Donald Jr., who dropped to the ground to do a commando roll underneath the conference room table before hopping to his feet, readjusting the metal colander on his head, and turning to salute the chief of naval operations. “I’ve mastered 10 kinds of kicks, including some ninja ones.”   “We’re gonna stomp their nukes,” Eric Trump added as he lifted his foot and attempted to crush an empty soda can, which soon became stuck to his heel.   White House staff confirmed that earlier in the day, the Trump boys had been observed in the Treaty Room setting up a homemade obstacle course, which included two rows of wastebaskets intended for tire drills and a series of couches that one had to leap across without touching the floor. The final leg of the course was said to have started in the State Dining Room, where the boys crawled on their stomachs through a tunnel of chair legs before shooting a rubber band at an 1804 oil painting of Dolley Madison and sprinting down the hallway to touch the mantel in the East Room.   The Trump boys reportedly showed off their skills to the silent military leaders, with Eric performing nine sit-ups in a row while Donald Jr. landed several blows on an empty office chair using a potato masher as a sword. Sources said the brothers then began to demonstrate their hand-to-hand combat techniques and grappled with each other until Eric tripped over four-star general and Marine Corps commandant Robert Neller’s chair, hitting the floor and getting the wind knocked out of him.     “We’re gonna parachute into the jungle and then sneak into Pong-gong [sic],” said Eric Trump, removing the catcher’s mask he had been wearing to reveal camouflage face paint made from the blue-shimmer and coral colors he found in first lady Melania Trump’s eye shadow palettes. “We’re really good at hiding. And we invented a secret code—if one of us is in trouble, we make a bird call, and the bad guys can’t tell it’s us.”   “Ca-caw!” he added.   Unrolling a piece of construction paper on the table, the Trump boys revealed a hand-drawn map of North Korea, which they had reportedly depicted as a green square completely surrounded by blue water and fiery explosions. The page also included what appeared to be the boys’ battle plan, a series of bullet-points reading, “Spy. Get the plans. Escape in helicopter.”   Several sources indicated that the Trump boys then handed Mattis a list of supplies they would need shipped to North Korea for their mission, including two M1 Abrams battle tanks, their very own dog tags, red headbands, a crate of assault rifles, boxes of Little Debbie snack cakes, a carton of pizza-flavored Goldfish crackers, juice boxes, and something they referred to as a “laser stealth boat.”   “We practiced guns really hard, and now we’re awesome at shooting,” said Eric Trump, pulling up a video on his phone of the brothers making machine gun noises as they stood on the North Lawn driveway and used a garden hose nozzle to spray at a chalk drawing of angry-looking faces labeled “Bad Guys.” “Our aim is super good.”   “We can do arrows, too,” added Donald Jr., pulling a carbon-fiber arrow from a quiver on his back and loading the compound bow he had recently received as a birthday gift from his father.   At press time, White House staff reported a screaming Eric Trump was seen running through the West Wing with an arrow lodged in the couch cushion strapped to his chest.

"WASHINGTON—Returning to the private sector after eight years of service as presidential decoys, the White House’s team of surgically altered Barack Obama body doubles are reportedly struggling to find work since losing their jobs last month. The two dozen former Secret Service agents, each of whom underwent highly invasive cosmetic procedures in 2009 to more convincingly pose as the 44th president, told reporters that there seem to be dishearteningly few opportunities in the current job market for near-perfect replicas of Barack Obama. “Most businesses worry that their customers or employees will be distracted or unsettled by the sight of me, so I haven’t received any job offers yet,” said Obama double Andrew Weaver, who after seven rounds of facial reconstructive surgery and months studying his mannerisms is now completely indistinguishable from the former president. “Agreeing to let doctors file down my cheekbones and modulate my larynx was fantastic for my career in the short term, but I applied for a job with the Baltimore Police Department the other day, and they wouldn’t even consider me. It’s frustrating, because I have a lot to offer.” “After all, I was the third-highest-ranking double for the president,” he added. Sources said that many of the agents, some of whom had their shins broken and reset in order to ensure they stood at Obama’s precise height of 73 inches, have been forced by their difficult job searches to relocate well outside the D.C. area. And despite being trained to escape assassination attempts and withstand brutal interrogations, the Obama decoys said they are often immediately disqualified by employers for any position that requires face-to-face contact with another human being. Several of the men lamented that health plans under the Affordable Care Act don’t cover elective cosmetic surgeries, leaving them with little hope of ever reversing the procedures, which reportedly also included forehead lifts and gene therapy designed to alter their skin pigmentation. While the current White House has offered to rehire them, the Obama doubles said they did not want to undergo the series of extremely painful operations necessary to resemble President Donald Trump, only to find themselves jobless once more in four or, at most, eight years. “Washing dishes isn’t glamorous, but it’s a steady job, so I consider myself one of the lucky ones,” said Allen O’Neal, now an employee of Ruth’s Chris Steak House in Lexington, KY, who sat in for the president during a visit to Saudi Arabia and met with an unwitting President Vladimir Putin in 2015. “I know a couple of the other guys managed to get jobs together at a car wash in Cincinnati, and they say it’s all right.” “If I get tired of this place, I might be able to go work with them,” he added. While acknowledging that there are a handful of opportunities for Obama impersonators to perform on the major cruise lines or throw out the first pitch at Single-A baseball games, the doubles said a non-compete clause in their old White House contracts strictly limits their ability to take on such engagements. One of the Obama lookalikes reportedly paid steep fines after he was caught charging six figures for unauthorized speeches he made to defense contractors and pharmaceutical companies. “When I was first recruited into the program, it was a real career highlight, but now that I’m back on the job market, I’m having regrets,” said Jason Newburg, 55, who added that he has struggled with depression since leaving the job in which he conducted a joint press conference with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and hosted the 2013 NBA champion Miami Heat while the real president was in meetings with his national security team. “Things are looking up, though. I’m close to landing a job at a call center for a pretty decent-sized bank, and meanwhile, I’ve got a ribbon-cutting gig at a supermarket in Dallas next Saturday.” “Plus, last week, the White House called me and asked if I could show up to a state funeral,” he added. “There’s no way I’m passing that up.” ",1,Surgically Altered Obama Doubles Struggling To Find Work After Presidency
"In the troubled, politically charged times in which our country finds itself,   takes great pride in being the sole beacon of truth and integrity in journalism. No matter how explosive the revelations brought to light by our sources, no matter how their publication may upset the established order, this storied newspaper has sworn an oath to provide the American people with the facts necessary to serve as informed democratic citizens. Today, after an exclusive series of interviews with accuser Jaime T. Phillips,   was able to publish just such a story, revealing that Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore impregnated her during a sexual relationship conducted while she was 15 years old. These are the facts, provided directly to us by Ms. Phillips in a series of on-the-record interviews conducted over the past 24 hours: 1) That in 1992, while spending a summer in Alabama, a teenage Ms. Phillips began a secret relationship with a then-55-year-old Roy Moore. 2) That, during this relationship, Roy Moore repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her, leading to a pregnancy. 3) That, at Mr. Moore’s instruction, Ms. Philips underwent a secretive abortion. To our editorial board’s knowledge, no other news source has been entrusted with this incredible story. Indeed, in her first phone call to us, Ms. Philips repeatedly insisted that   was her first and only choice to bring forth such allegations. Why did she entrust America’s Finest News Source with these groundbreaking details? Perhaps she knew other newspapers would be intimidated into cowardly silence by the far-reaching fallout from these revelations. Perhaps she was simply conscious of our lengthy history of award-winning and earth-shattering reportage, and she knew no other publication would do. Whatever the reason, the evidence corroborating her story is insurmountable. Unquestionably, this dramatic account required fact-checking of the caliber only   can provide, and while several small inconsistencies emerged—notably, the employer that Ms. Phillips provided us, NFM Lending, had no knowledge of her existence and denied she ever held a position there—the common-sense explanation from Ms. Phillips that she “worked remotely” and that we had “called the wrong branch” quickly put to bed any doubt that would prevent her account’s publication. Similarly, despite timely considerations such as the coming December election in which Mr. Moore will serve as the GOP candidate and the coming Pulitzer Prize nominations for which this story may be eligible, readers can dispel any notion that this journalistic enterprise was rushed to publication. Simply put,   is willing to stake its nearly 252-year history of sterling, unbiased reportage upon the verity of these claims. In less than two weeks, citizens in Alabama must make a choice on who they will propel into the profound duty of serving in the United States Senate. With these heinous allegations—and the bravery of Ms. Phillips—in mind, we are confident they will make the correct choice.

"CAMBRIDGE, MA—A trove of recently unearthed documents dating back to the sixth century B.C. has revealed that the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras wrote dozens of elaborate, unhinged conspiracy theorems pertaining to triangles, researchers announced Wednesday. Upon examining a cache of papyrus scrolls found while excavating a site near the modern Italian city of Crotone, a team of historians and classical scholars at Harvard University discovered previously unknown writings by Pythagoras and others that suggest the philosopher was obsessed with proving triangles played a powerful but highly secretive role in the world he inhabited, controlling nearly every aspect of life. “These conspiracy theorems shed new light on this historic figure, who was apparently suspicious of the fact that all triangles have interior angles adding up to 180 degrees, believing this was evidence that they were united in hiding some sort of covert agenda,” said Professor Janet Boisvert, who found among the artifacts an alternative version of the Pythagorean theorem in which Pythagoras concluded that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle was equal to the sum of “all the lies embodied by these cursed triangles!” “One scroll is 35 feet long and contains nothing but a rambling series of postulates attempting to demonstrate the existence of a triangle with three obtuse angles that he thought was being kept under wraps by the government.” “Pythagoras also stayed up every night for two years working on formulas he believed would prove the Great Pyramid at Giza was a hoax perpetrated by pro-triangle propagandists,” she added. According to Boisvert, Pythagoras’ fixation on conspiracy theorems was described in the written accounts of his students, who recalled visiting his private study and finding the walls, the tables, and nearly every available surface covered in intricate equations and charts depicting hundreds of scalene, isosceles, and equilateral triangles. One student noted that Pythagoras always seemed worried by the sheer number of triangles he saw around him, and he became extremely distraught one day upon realizing that quadrilaterals, which he had until then considered innocuous, were in fact nothing more than two triangles combined. This paranoia is further corroborated by the diary entry of a goatherd who described an elderly mathematician wandering the streets of Metapontum and warning complete strangers about the sails of ships, the shapes of their own noses, and the encroaching power of the trigonocracy. “We are now able to conclusively identify Pythagoras as the unnamed figure in the   of Herodotus who storms into a polis council meeting waving pages scrawled with formulas and screaming, ‘Triangles are all around us, hidden in every shape, and I have the proofs!’ before being escorted out,” Boisvert said. “He continued to demand the truth from local magistrates, having hypothesized that triangles had a fourth, invisible side that those in power didn’t want him to know about.” “It’s likely that by this point, his obsession with conspiracy theorems had begun to take a toll on his home life,” she continued. “We know an increasingly isolated Pythagoras was left by his wife and four children around 515 B.C., shortly after he accused they themselves of being triangles.” Documents indicate Pythagoras went on to live a hermetic existence in the foothills of Mount Parnassus, until the realization that even the mountain itself had a triangular shape eventually drove him to suicide.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the finished work would become the “definitive take” on his time in the White House, Barack Obama reportedly submitted a collection of pages from his presidential graphic novel,  , to publisher Image Comics on Thursday. The 16-page packet of artwork and sample issues, which Obama confirmed he has also mailed to Fantagraphics Books, Dark Horse Comics, and DC’s Vertigo imprint, is said to serve as a proof of concept for what he envisions as a sprawling eight-volume memoir of his presidency. According to Obama, creating an authentic representation of his two terms in office has required him to use every tool of the comics medium, from dramatic splash pages in which he appears silhouetted behind the Resolute desk, to an extended dream sequence set on the eve of his 2012 reelection, which he said takes “definite cues” from the casual surrealism of graphic novelist Chris Ware in order to fully realize the emotional truth of the moment. “I’ve poured everything into  ’s panels, and when it’s complete, it will depict these eight years of my life precisely as I experienced them,” said the 44th president of the United States, who told reporters that he planned to pencil, ink, and hand-letter each page of the series himself. “Readers will get a true sense of my time as president right from the opening of Volume #1:  , where I cut between full-color panels of my first inaugural address and stark black-and-white illustrations of ordinary Americans disillusioned by the Great Recession, two protracted wars overseas, and a lack of access to healthcare.” Added Obama, “By the time the editors over at Vertigo read the sequence where I’m climbing the steps of the North Portico, and we suddenly flash back to a parallel scene of my origin story in Honolulu, climbing up a volcanic rock in the exact same pose, I’m pretty sure they’ll be hooked.” The idea for  , which is expected to span more than 1,200 pages when completed, reportedly emerged in the aftermath of the disastrous 2010 midterm elections, when a brooding Obama would stay up late in the darkened Oval Office, drafting hundreds of variations on his concept art to “nail the look” of minor details such as the sunlit sheen on an MQ-1 Predator drone or the exact shade of primary antagonist John Boehner’s blue eyes. Discussing his efforts to capture events on the page just as they happened in real life, the former commander in chief admitted he owed much to   co-creator Brian K. Vaughan, whose “masterful blend” of rapid-fire action and political intrigue influenced his own approach to the bin Laden raid, which will appear in Volume #4:  . Obama said he created a kinetic sense of motion by extending SEAL Team Six’s HK416 assault rifles into the page’s bleed and lettering the onomatopoeic “chh-chh-chh” of the helicopters in such a way that the words wrap around their whirring blades. “Back in 2013, when I was really torn about how to respond to Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, I started imagining myself as two different presidents simultaneously enacting two different policies—and suddenly I knew that was exactly how I had to illustrate this moment of my presidency,” said Obama, whose graphic novel also features dual versions of himself that voice opposing sides of tense debates that play out within his mind. “I started sketching right then and there­: one set of panels in which I launch military strikes, and one in which I don’t. Both end in disaster, showing that, in the end, no good choices were available.” “I bet   illustrator [David] Mazzucchelli would be perfect for capturing the mood of a war-weary nation in those scenes,” Obama continued, saying he would be open to collaboration with outside colorists. “God, that would look so freaking cool.” Despite  ’s dense political narrative, the former president was quick to note it would also include moments of humor and even tenderness, such as episodes imagined from the perspective of first dogs Bo and Sunny Obama, and recurring romantic vignettes about first lady Michelle Obama, which will be painted in watercolors to provide a stark break from the more rigid inking used to portray his actions as the nation’s chief executive. Obama stressed that, overall, his series would be “gritty, heady stuff,” and more akin to a novel than traditional superhero fare. “Generations from now, I want Americans to be able to read these pages and be confident they’re getting an unalloyed picture of my presidency,” he said. “  will cover mature, difficult subjects, and some of it may require multiple readings to understand, but this graphic novel is the only way to accurately convey my experiences. I realize, of course, it may be a bit too much for more sensitive readers to handle.” “Especially once you get into Volume #8,” Obama added. “Right at the beginning, Justice Scalia is killed off, and after that things start to turn dark pretty fast.” ",1,Obama Sends Publisher Collection Of Pages For Presidential Graphic Novel
"WASHINGTON—Swerving hard as it sped away down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump’s limousine reportedly gunned it around a corner and through the streets of the nation’s capital Thursday in a frantic attempt to throw special counsel Robert Mueller from its roof. Witnesses at the scene said the 73-year-old former FBI director—who is leading the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia—relentlessly pursued the presidential limo on foot and eventually heaved himself up onto the car, trying to question the commander in chief about his contacts with foreign entities known to have interfered in the 2016 election. “Go, go, go, go!” a Secret Service agent reportedly shouted from inside the heavily armored vehicle which, after pulling out of the White House gate, was seen hopping a curb and plowing through a row of hedges into Edward R. Murrow Park. “Come on! Floor it!” “Goddammit, he’s still up there,” the agent continued as Mueller began pounding on the back windshield and telling the president that he just needed some clarification on a few things. “We’ve got to shake him!” Sources said the driver made every effort to dislodge the special counsel, maneuvering between lanes, onto sidewalks, and through a barricaded construction zone, but Mueller managed to maintain his grip on the car, at one point clinging to a door handle with a single hand as the vehicle skidded around Dupont Circle. He was said to have appeared completely calm and expressionless as he held a written request for financial records up to the president’s tinted window, even when the limo zigzagged through the Georgetown University campus and accelerated to full speed over the Francis Scott Key bridge, sending pedestrians diving into the Potomac River. According to witnesses, when the driver hit the brakes to avoid running over a street vendor selling T-shirts, hats, and other patriotic memorabilia, Mueller was sent tumbling down onto the car’s hood, where, for the first time, the president and his men made eye contact with the prosecutor. “Hand over the documents, Mr. President,” Mueller said as the vehicle slammed into reverse, sideswiping a row of parked cars, careening through a crowd of Chinese tourists, and snapping off street signs as if they were twigs. “The U.S. Department of Justice has granted me broad subpoena powers in this matter. You’re better off just giving me the papers now. It’s not too late to come clean.” “You’re making a big mistake, sir,” Mueller added when the driver steered the limo into an alley and attempted to pin him against a dumpster. Reports from motorists indicated that most vehicles were able to veer out of the way as the president’s car bolted through traffic, though one tractor-trailer was confirmed to have swerved into an embankment and tipped onto its side, forcing the limo to abruptly change course and drive straight through the lobby of an office tower. As the car exited the building in a shower of sparks and falling debris, Mueller reportedly emerged unscathed, continuing to issue his demands for records relating to the Trump Organization’s worldwide financial holdings. “I just heard people screaming to get out of the way, and then this massive black car came barreling down the street,” said pedestrian Anna Stockworth, who estimated the limo was traveling at more than 100 mph when it clipped a newsstand and spun around in a full circle, its tires screeching and smoking as the special counsel was finally ejected from its roof. “I think that might have been the president!” Onlookers noted that after rolling across the pavement and lying motionless for several seconds, Mueller stood up, wiped a small trickle of blood from his mouth, straightened his tie, and then slowly and calmly walked back to his office.

"NEW YORK—In a groundbreaking new study published Friday in  , a team of leading historians has proved that meditation originally spread from ancient China because a single, highly annoying monk went around telling everyone how much it had changed his life. Analyzing documents uncovered across the Eurasian continent, researchers determined that the monk, who lived in the seventh century A.D. and learned rudimentary breathing and visualization exercises from a group of Mahayana Buddhists, traveled widely and talked constantly about how practicing meditation for only a week had fundamentally altered his personal outlook. From the Korean peninsula to the Central Asian steppes, he is believed to have aggravated people everywhere he went, inevitably shifting every conversation to the importance of mindfulness and being centered, even when it was clear no one was interested. “There are mentions of an unbearably irritating monk in many texts from the period, and once we realized they were all referring to the same person, we were able to conclude that much of the Eastern world learned about meditation from this one sanctimonious asshole,” said study co-author Sheila Ryan of New York University, explaining that contemporary accounts indicated the monk would travel the Silk Road via merchant caravan, nagging his drivers about the value of observing one’s negative thoughts without resistance or judgment. “For example, scrolls from Asuka-period Japan indicate the island nation’s first exposure to the practice was this monk droning on and on about all the insight he’d gained from a weekend spent meditating in Tibet. “Our research shows that from Mongolia all the way down to Java, everyone hated this smug prick,” Ryan added. In the fragments that remain of their written correspondence, traders who traveled the same routes as the monk remarked upon how every time a person said something negative, the exasperating little shit would invariably chime in with unsolicited advice about how they just needed to accept their worries for what they were and learn to appreciate the present moment. Three separate diaries found far apart from one another in present-day Cambodia, Bhutan, and Afghanistan independently verify that whenever the monk bragged about his morning meditation routine, people secretly wanted to punch him in the face. According to the historians, the evidence they amassed has allowed them to confirm that a figure who appears in several gombi-style paintings from the period is in fact this same monk. In one typical depiction, which places the monk in the ancient city-state of Srivijaya around 680 A.D., he is seen sitting on a mat and meditating in the middle of a busy market square as visibly annoyed passersby shuffle past, many of them appearing to shake their heads, roll their eyes, or stare at him in quiet derision.  To this day, scholars have observed, oral histories passed down for centuries in remote parts of rural China tell of a monk who pestered the fuck out of everyone he could find until they reluctantly agreed to attend his shitty introduction to mindfulness course. “In his extensive travelogues, the Tang dynasty writer Yi Jing describes an episode in which a man we now believe to have been this monk continually disrupts a hard-at-work blacksmith with lectures about how the mind is a muscle that must be exercised just like any other,” Ryan said. “Apparently, the only thing this pain-in-the-ass ever talked about was how spending 10 minutes a day focusing on his breathing had made him more relaxed and productive. He kept badgering everyone to let him lead them through a guided meditation so they could see how great it was. Some people even tried it just to get him to shut the fuck up.” “Our findings suggest he spread meditation to as much as 40 percent of Asia,” she continued. “He might have kept going, too, but after the monk told the Khmer emperor Jayavarman II that his empire would be much larger if he just tried a few simple stress-reduction techniques, he was beheaded on the spot.” ",1,Historians Discover Meditation Spread From Ancient China By Annoying Monk Who Wouldn’t Shut Up About How It Changed His Life
"CORAL GABLES, FL—In an attempt to tell the story of his failed candidacy in his own words, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has rented out a local black box theater and debuted a one-man show that chronicles the tragedy of his 2016 presidential campaign, sources reported Thursday. According to those in attendance opening night, the two-act solo piece, entitled  , traces the 64-year-old’s path from well-heeled Republican frontrunner to presidential also-ran in a 150-minute performance that features monologues, character vignettes, musical interludes, and a 10-minute interpretive dance sequence in which Bush starts out as an egg and then goes on to reenact his childhood. Clad in a black T-shirt and black jeans, the onetime White House hopeful reportedly moves barefoot across the stage, which, apart from a single lectern, is completely empty. “Why, you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when people expected big things from me—though I don’t suppose you’d want to hear about that, would you?” Bush wonders aloud during an early scene, speaking as an elderly version of himself and hobbling downstage with a cane in his hand. “Well, believe it or not, I once stood before a crowd of cheering people who were awfully excited to hear me say, ‘I’m a candidate for president of the United States of America.’” “Here I am now—it’s June 2015, I’m in Miami, and I’ve just announced my campaign,” continues Bush, mimicking the roar of the crowd as he mimes shaking supporters’ hands and kissing babies. “Yessir, I had the whole world on a string: I’d come up with a strong message about jobs and immigration, and folks had given my Super PAC more than a hundred million bucks. My friends and I thought the future was just waiting for us to reach out and grab it. My God, we were so naïve! Standing before all those bright lights and flashing cameras, I had gone blind.” Theater patrons confirmed that the show, which runs three nights a week through Dec. 20 at the Gables Playhouse Upstairs Stage, includes a monologue in which candidate Bush, puffing out his chest, speaks confidently about how he will undo President Barack Obama’s policies. Soon, however, the stage lights begin rapidly flickering on and off, his words grow more and more confused, and he wanders out into the aisles of the theater mumbling incoherent syllables into the ears of audience members. Another memorable scene reportedly finds Bush reenacting the third Republican presidential debate: slouching forward and affecting the Jersey dialect of Chris Christie, then smirking and taking on a sharp nasal tone to impersonate Ted Cruz. Sources said Bush quickly jumps from one part of the stage to another, cycling faster and faster through the personas of all 10 GOP candidates until the scene, like the debate itself, devolves into chaos. Attendees noted that Bush saves his most damning portrayal for Donald Trump, ending each of his chief antagonist’s lines by whispering, “Lies, lies, lies.” As the Trump character berates him with insults, Bush slowly moves upstage, making himself smaller and smaller and eventually curling up into a fetal position. “You’ve lost New Hampshire, you’ve lost Iowa, it all comes down to South Carolina,” Bush says in the play’s final moments, repeatedly shouting “South Carolina, here we come!” at the top of his lungs as he drags the lectern upstage and stands behind it. “The people have voted. The returns are in. Fourth place. A crushing, humiliating defeat. It’s all over. My journey has ended.” “What a poison draught to swallow,” continues Bush, a spotlight slowly contracting until only his anguished face is visible as he falls to his knees and grasps frantically at his hair. “What a bitter pill. And why, why was I forsaken? What manner of country would bleed a man dry, suck the very marrow from his bones, then cast him aside like so many broken playthings? O, perfidy! O, pride! I’m sorry, big brother! I’m sorry, Father! And I’m sorry, Mr. Reagan—to you most of all. I feel the rushing tide of history leaving me to drown in its wake. Yet here, so close to the end, I also find the veil has been lifted, and I can see beyond to catch a glimpse of this nation’s future. Shall I tell you what I see? Oh, don’t ask it! For the vision in my mind’s eye is no shining city on a hill. No, I see only darkness. I see destruction. I see death. God bless America, and God help us all.” Theater ushers confirmed a section of front-row seats that had been roped off and reserved for members of the Bush family remained empty throughout the performance.

"WASHINGTON—Springing into action the moment their SCOTUS wristwatch transponders signaled the alert, all nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court reportedly gathered in their top-secret subterranean chambers Friday to receive their latest directive from the giant holographic head of former Chief Justice John Marshall. After racing into the Supreme Court Building and seating themselves on the bench in order of seniority, current Chief Justice John Roberts and his eight associate justices are said to have raised their right hands and exclaimed, “We, the Guardians of Liberty!” Then, sources said, a lever activated by pulling down the scales on a marble statue of Lady Justice dropped them into nine separate chutes, through which they slid down toward the high-tech underground command center where the disembodied face of the early 19th-century jurist briefs them on new missions. “Justices, it seems there’s trouble afoot with the regulatory oversight of interstate commerce, and we need your special combination of skills to resolve the matter,” the 20-foot hologram of John Marshall said as the court members arrived in the massive titanium-lined bunker and stood attentively in a circle around him, their arms crossed or akimbo. “Justice Kagan, we’ll need your disciplined jurisprudence and opinion-writing powers. Justice Thomas, we need the full strength of your textualist interpretations. And Chief Justice Roberts, we’ll count on you to hold any noncompliant parties in contempt of this court. Only with the combined powers of the Nine can we fairly interpret precedent and the Constitution as it applies to U.S. law.” “Now, gaze into the Globe of  !” Marshall added as hundreds of holographs of appellate filings appeared in a mist-filled sphere in the room’s center. “Remember: The fate of federal shipping regulation depends upon you!” Marshall reportedly summoned the justices at 8:38 p.m., forcing many to abandon their grocery shopping, trips to the opera, and scouting missions high above the D.C. skyline, which they regularly patrol in the Habeas Copter. According to sources, Justice Alito hurriedly pulled on his black robe, turned to the beautiful Swiss model lying in the bed of his Alpine château, and said, “I’m sorry, justice has called.” Meanwhile, Justice Ginsburg, who was spotted shooting pool at the Foggy Bottom Roadhouse, was said by witnesses to have sunk her last shot, grabbed a large pile of bills off the table’s rail, and thanked a group of scowling gang members for their generosity before hopping on her Kawasaki Ninja EX300 and tearing off down Constitution Avenue. Speaking on condition of anonymity, several Supreme Court clerks told reporters their bosses are routinely summoned by the projection of the nation’s longest-serving chief justice, who is now in his third century of contacting court members, often in the middle of the night, to handle juridical emergencies relating to matters such as contract law, commercial litigation, patent disputes, arbitration agreements, and more. “I warn you, this will be your most crucial mission yet—you’ll need these tools of the judiciary to protect yourselves,” Marshall said as nine golden gavels descended from the ceiling into the justices’ outstretched hands. “Not since last year’s   mission, when we lost our beloved colleague Justice Scalia, have we faced a challenge like this.” “May the powers of Article III watch over you all,” Marshall added before his hologram burst into smoke and the chamber filled with light. Sources confirmed the Supreme Court’s robotic clerk, Amicus, then stumbled into the room with a rickety cart of case files, prompting the justices to roll their eyes. The hapless automaton exclaimed, “Oh, heavens!” and knocked to the floor hundreds of pages of applicable documents from  ,  , and the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938. Having received their briefing, the highest-ranking members of the federal judiciary spent a few moments inside the Certiorari Pod—a glowing, neon-green capsule that allows the justices to communicate telepathically, debating the merits of a case at light speed—and then assembled on a round elevator platform emblazoned with the seal of the Supreme Court. “Well, team, you heard Marshall: It sounds like we’ve got our deliberations cut out for us,” Roberts said as the elevator brought the justices back up to the courtroom. “But if I know one thing, it’s that injustice can never win when we work together as a team—and, yeah, I mean you, too, Amicus. Now repeat after me: Equal justice under the law!” “Equal justice under the law!” the jurists shouted as they joined their gavels together in a triumphant salute and then slammed them down in unison. At press time, officials confirmed the Supreme Court had declined to render a verdict on the case, sending the decision back down to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration.

"CENTRAL VALLEY, NY—According to reports from across the country, millions of moms set out Saturday morning on a mass pilgrimage to the premium outlet center, following in the footsteps of mothers before them who for ages have participated in the same sacred rite. The moms, many of whom undertook arduous journeys of more than two hours, reportedly sought to attain discounts of up to 65 percent on name-brand fashions and accessories, braving the teeming throngs of fellow pilgrims who inevitably overwhelmed the parking garages and landscaped pedestrian walkways of the venerated site. “Oh my God, it’s so beautiful. I’m in awe just being here and seeing these incredible bargains with my own eyes,” said Philadelphia-area mom Debbie Palmer, 41, as she walked her first of several ritual circles around Dior, Armani Exchange, Ralph Lauren, and two dozen other hallowed storefronts. “It wasn’t easy traveling here, but it was worth it for the opportunity to take part in something like this. It’s truly overwhelming. Everything’s on clearance, and the huge savings are just so inspiring.” “I wasn’t prepared for just how transformational this day would be,” added Palmer, wiping away a tear as she picked up a five-piece hand towel set marked down to $23.99. “It’s a dream come true.” Clad in the traditional pilgrim’s garb of comfort-fit jeans, a light jacket, and Aerosoles slip-ons, a sea of mothers—who timed their journeys to coincide with annual Columbus Day weekend sales—reportedly swarmed in front of the outlet center’s directory and performed ceremonial invocations, reciting the names and map coordinates of the retailers they wished to visit. Sources said that in keeping with tradition, the amassed moms then congregated around a scarf in a Burberry window display and chanted, “Oh, that’s cute,” before continuing on to the Nike Factory Store, Last Call by Neiman Marcus, and Zwilling J.A. Henckels. According to witnesses, most of the pilgrims only paused in their spiritual quest to partake in the modest meal of a small, no-topping Pinkberry cup or to make their way down the narrow thoroughfare between the Clarins and Ferragamo stores to where the “nice bathrooms” are. Soon after their arrival, reports confirmed, mothers were already bedecked in a variety of shopping bags from the outlet center’s more than 200 holy sites, and as the day wore on, many within the swelling, overheated crowds could be seen removing their windbreakers and tying them around their waists. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt that I had to make this journey and experience the marked-down prices for myself,” said Bethany Haskell of Baltimore, a 39-year-old mom who bowed alongside dozens of other women to inspect a set of Crate & Barrel candleholders. “Yes, there were obstacles: a missed turn on Google Maps, getting a good parking spot near the entrance, standing in long lines for fitting rooms with moms who didn’t even speak my language. But it’s all worth it once you’re at the register getting two really great handbags for the price of one.” Sources told reporters that due to the massive influx of mothers, the site perennially suffers from overcrowding, as evidenced by the significant wait time required to purchase decaf hazelnut coffee at the Pret a Manger. In addition, they said, pilgrims routinely require medical assistance, especially elderly grandmothers who are in poor health but have nonetheless devoted themselves to purchasing early Christmas presents at the Samsonite and Yankee Candle stores. “I can’t describe how overwhelmed and happy I felt the moment I walked into the Tommy Hilfiger outlet and saw a pair of khakis that was just perfect for my little Miles,” said Mary Alvarez, 36, a Boston-area mother of three. “But getting 25 percent off bed linens for the whole family was the most thrilling part. And it’s so great to know that one day, when my daughters are old enough, they too will have this wonderful experience.”  “This has reaffirmed my faith in designer labels, which I truly believe are available to anyone willing to endure hardships and make sacrifices for them,” she added. At press time, reports confirmed that more than 300 mothers had been crushed in a stampede after the North Face suddenly marked down all its fur-lined winter coats to half price.

"TOBYHANNA, PA—With preclinical studies of an in-development cholesterol-reducing medication now complete, Food and Drug Administration officials confirmed Monday they would be conducting initial trials of the new drug at a large party house they had rented in upstate Pennsylvania. According to the FDA, around a dozen researchers will participate in the experimental pharmaceutical’s weekend-long test, which is taking place in the Poconos at a 2,500-square-foot lakeside cottage the agency found on Airbnb. The participating scientists will reportedly be the first humans to take the drug known as Bisovastatin, studying its effects in a variety of settings, from the indoor hot tub to the spacious deck out back. “Clinical testing is a vital step in the process of approving a medication, and that’s why we’re up at this sweet cabin seeing if this shit’s the real deal,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, as her arriving colleagues passed around a joint, “pregaming” before the new cholesterol treatment’s randomized, controlled study began. “Whenever a drug makes it this far in the evaluation process, we pack up [biochemist Simon F.] Hadley’s car, grab some brews, and head up here for a nonstop weekend of pharmacological safety and efficacy assessments.” “Let’s get this fucking phase-zero trial started, baby!” Woodcock added.  Sources confirmed that before traveling upstate, FDA scientists obtained several hundred pills of Bisovastatin from pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. and stored them inside an empty bottle of ibuprofen. Upon reaching the five-bedroom house, the researchers are said to have determined that its outdoor fire pit would provide the ideal clinical environment for staying up all night to observe the effects of the new drug on themselves and one another. The FDA stated that Dr. William Slikker Jr., director of the National Center for Toxicological Research, volunteered to remain sober and babysit the others, providing orange slices in the event the side effects of the drug became too overwhelming and one of the researchers needed to chill out. Officials said they wanted to avoid a repeat of an unfortunate 2015 incident in which a scientist who had taken way too much of a new myeloma treatment drug freaked out, jumped through a third-floor window, and broke both legs. “I’m definitely going to lie on the front lawn, analyze how this drug inhibits the HMG-CoA enzyme, and just stare up at the clouds,” Woodcock said as the researchers all sat down on beanbag chairs in the party house’s loft to take their first dose of Bisovastatin together. “And I can’t wait to go into the woods where there are no distractions and you can really enjoy being out in nature as the stuff kicks in and your LDL levels start to go down.” “Of course, part of our job is to observe how the drug interacts with other substances, which is why we have this 30-pack of Bud Light and handle of Jim Beam,” continued Woodcock, noting that other researchers would try combining the drug with blood pressure medications and immunosuppressants. “Most of us are just sticking with the regular dose, but [Dr.] Patrick [Caldwell] has a way higher tolerance, so he’s going to take double to see if that does anything.” Several researchers said they planned to test Bisovastatin’s efficacy while lying in hammocks on the porch and using the house’s sound system to blast a Spotify playlist that had been created by the FDA’s Division of Pharmacometrics and was said to include selections from Animal Collective, Black Lips, and MGMT. Giuseppe Randazzo, a director in the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality, announced that he would be willing to take the new drug and have sex with a colleague at the same time in order to study “just how crazy that would be.” Woodcock remarked that you could never be sure what would happen during a night at the party house, recalling that the last time they experimented with a cholesterol medication, one of the researchers tried mixing it with a high dose of Klonopin and they later found him passed out on the dock in a diabetic coma. “We hope to emerge from the weekend with a clearer picture of whether this shit is good to go or whether we’ll have to decline approval of Bisovastatin for U.S. markets,” Woodcock said. “But right now we got, like, 800 milligrams per person, and we’re all ready to just kick back and enjoy two incredible days of mind-blowing research.” “Except for the people who got placebos,” Woodcock added. “It sucks to be them.” ",1,FDA Rents Party House Upstate To Test New Drug
"PASADENA, CA—As part of ongoing preparations for a manned mission to the Red Planet, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced Wednesday that its autonomous Mars Roomba vehicle had landed safely and commenced the task of cleaning dust from the planet’s surface. A NASA spokesperson confirmed that the circular, 1,900-pound, self-navigating vacuum had survived the 8-month journey from Earth with all vital sweeping and suction systems intact and had already begun removing iron oxide particles and small debris from the approximately 55.9 million square miles of Martian terrain. “We’re pleased to say that after years of planning, the Mars Roomba is finally hard at work cleaning some of the dustiest parts of the Red Planet,” said senior engineer James Wurzburg, describing the jubilant scene at mission control after the Roomba successfully touched down and immediately started vacuuming loose pebbles and dust kicked up by its retrorockets during descent. “Everything from the bristle brushes to the satellite mapping software is currently functioning as designed. In fact, the Roomba has already made significant progress in tidying up the Schiaparelli Crater.” “At this rate, we project that the entire planet will be spick and span by the time the first astronauts arrive,” added Wurzburg. According to NASA officials, the Mars Roomba uses a number of advanced features to navigate and clean up around its environment, including independently spinning tracks of all-terrain wheels that allow it to turn a full 360 degrees while traveling at a maximum speed of 1.3 kilometers per hour, and an array of proximity sensors that can discern steep slopes and prevent it from accidentally plunging into a canyon. Additionally, NASA personnel confirmed the autonomous cleaning vehicle includes a contact-detecting front bumper that signals it to change directions whenever it encounters a large boulder or other obstacle.  For power, mission engineers confirmed that the Mars Roomba employs a portable nuclear reactor that provides up to three sols worth of cleaning time before the vehicle is forced to return to its self-charging station. Prior to the Roomba’s launch, researchers reportedly spent six years testing various prototypes in a particularly dusty and desolate stretch of the Nevada desert, ultimately settling on a lightweight design that could remove all dirt down to the bedrock. “If we’re ever going to establish a long-term colony, it’s crucial that the planet is tidy,” said project director Kaitlyn Mendoza, highlighting the potential danger of future astronauts tracking muck all over the place. “The first Mars cleaning rover we sent in 1997, Sterility, had a pair of radio-controlled mop and bucket arms, but those just resulted in getting the Cydonia region all muddy. It’s a unique set of challenges compared to, say, the moon, where we could just have Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin clean the whole lunar surface with push brooms.” “But fortunately everything is going to plan with the Roomba, minus a brief period where it kept bumping into the Olympus Mons over and over,” Mendoza continued. At press time, NASA had announced a $37 billion mission to send someone to manually remove a large piece of meteorite that was clogging the Mars Roomba’s filter.

"WASHINGTON—Saying they could “live out here in the wild for months” if they had to, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly spent Wednesday rounding up supplies of comic books and candy bars as they prepared to hide out that night from special prosecutors in their makeshift White House Rose Garden fort. According to sources, the Trump boys were seen carrying pillows, fruit snacks, a Connect Four game, an assortment of action figures, a screwdriver, a pair of plates from the State Dining Room’s china service, and other supplies, making several trips out to the blanket fort where they planned to lie low during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between Russia and their father’s presidential campaign. “No one’s getting inside here—this place is super secure,” said Donald Jr., dumping a pillowcase filled with butter knives, a deck of Pokémon cards, and several individually wrapped Swiss cake rolls onto the fort’s grass floor. “We can forage during the day and sleep here at night. Mueller’s never gonna find us, not with all those leaves and twigs we put on the roof for camouflage.” “Even if he did, he’d never get past our booby traps,” added Donald Jr., referring to the thorny branches the brothers had gathered from nearby rose bushes and placed around the fort’s perimeter. Sources stated that the fort, located 30 feet from the West Wing Colonnade, has walls built from cardboard and loose piles of scrap wood, while its roof consists of blankets stripped from the president’s bed, which are draped over bushes and held down on the sides with a paperweight from the   desk and a bronze bust of Martin Luther King Jr. The entrance flap, which the Trump boys keep pulled shut at all times to conceal themselves from any lawyers seeking to question them about Russian interference in the election, is reportedly made from a tattered flag flown by the 29th Massachusetts Infantry during the Battle of Antietam. White House staff confirmed the boys tried to bring two overstuffed chairs out to the 5-by-7-foot fort, but abandoned them on the South Portico after finding them too heavy to carry. As they sprawled out instead on cushions taken from a couch in the Treaty Room, the brothers are believed to have drawn up secret plans in a spiral notebook, including a scheme in which they would wear ski masks and one of them would boost the other through the window of Mueller’s office to steal back all the documents he has subpoenaed. “We can tape these toilet-paper rolls together to make bignoculars [sic],” said Eric, placing the cardboard cylinders next to two long wrapping-paper tubes they planned to cover in aluminum foil and use as swords. “I’d like to see Mueller   to make us testify! We’ve got everything we need to outlast him: Froot Loops, my Nintendo DS, super glue, juice, a spool of real fishing line, a bike pump. I even brought a picture of the whole family so we’ll never forget what they look like.” “We can’t ever go back to our old lives,” continued Eric. “Except for going inside to use the bathroom—that’s allowed.” Needing kindling for the fire they would light at nightfall, sources said the Trump boys tore apart the frame and canvas of Charles Édouard Armand-Dumaresq’s circa 1873 painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which they had removed from the wall of the White House Cabinet Room. However, the brothers are said to have abandoned their attempts to start the fire after Eric burned his fingers while trying to use a Bic lighter to cook a hot dog. Reports confirmed that around 9 p.m., when Eric and Donald Jr. were listening intently for the footsteps of any special prosecutors who might be approaching in the darkness, they heard the sound of a twig snapping, which immediately caused them to shut off their flashlights and huddle deep inside their sleeping bags. “It’s Mueller!” whispered Donald Jr., holding a hand over Eric’s mouth to muffle his brother’s scream. “Quick, grab the secret notebook and run! I’ll attack him with the pruning shears!” “Wait, it’s just Melania with hot cocoa,” added Donald Jr., breathing a sigh of relief. “Tell her the password so we can let her in.” At approximately 3 a.m., a sobbing Eric Trump was seen marching toward the White House with a pillow under his arm, saying that he didn’t care if he got in trouble, he was tired and sad and just wanted to sleep in his own bed with all his stuff again.

"WASHINGTON—Staring out at the thick, foreboding jungle, a covert military intelligence unit sailed their patrol boat up an overgrown, booby-trapped stretch of the Potomac River in search of a deranged Gen. John F. Kelly, sources confirmed Wednesday. According to the boat’s crew, the small detachment of soldiers had been dispatched on classified orders from high within the U.S. military’s chain of command to locate the retired general and current White House chief of staff, who was rumored to have gone insane after traveling upriver to join the Trump administration months ago. “No one ever sails this deep into Washington, but that’s where Kelly’s gone, and that’s where we’re headed to track him down,” said the attack craft’s commanding officer Capt. Joseph Collins as the vessel passed silently through a narrow stretch of the river where the Lincoln Memorial towered above the canopy and the banks were lined with hidden rows of sharpened punji stakes. “When they gave us this mission, they filled us all in on Kelly’s background. He’s a four-star general, the military’s scion son, sent to bring order and stability to the White House. But I guess something inside him must have just snapped.” “God knows what happens to a man when he’s been in this environment so long,” Collins added, as the crew nervously scanned the mist-shrouded shoreline for signs of an ambush. Several reports indicated that the Navy patrol boat reached the American 14th Street Bridge outpost at approximately midnight and encountered a visibly dazed serviceman who made the weary crew’s “blood run cold” while recalling the traumatic events witnessed in the nation’s capital, describing Washington, D.C. as the “world’s asshole.” In addition, the commanding officer briefly considered turning back after spotting the mutilated body of Reince Priebus floating down the Potomac, but ultimately decided to continue the mission. Anonymous intelligence sources reported that Kelly’s tenure as chief of staff had begun with optimism that the general’s tactics could change the course of the struggling Trump administration. However, military leaders soon became concerned after Kelly’s daily status reports grew increasingly gruesome and incoherent, often including rambling philosophical passages on the fundamental chaos of human nature as well as graphic photographs of the summary executions of suspected rogue staffers. Military officials reportedly made the decision to track Kelly down after a September incident in which the former Department of Homeland Security secretary had reportedly begun a briefing by tossing the severed heads of multiple   reporters into the White House press pool. “You try not to think about some of the things you’ve heard about him, like how he supposedly wears a necklace made from the tongues of White House leakers,” said the boat’s seaman David “Stretch” Trudeau, adding that the crew had heard reports that a previous ship sent on their mission had disappeared, with rumors that the soldiers aboard had all joined forces with Kelly. “It’s hard to imagine what could make one of the most respected strategic minds of his generation throw away a five-decade military career like this, but then again, who knows what it’s like to be that deep inside this administration.” “They should never have left him out here like this,” Trudeau continued. At press time, the crew had reportedly emerged from thick underbrush onto the White House South Lawn to find Kelly standing amidst a circle of his followers ritualistically slaughtering a trussed, naked Senator Bob Corker (R-TN).

"WASHINGTON—Saying it was the first step in gaining the confidence and stability he would need to reintegrate back into society, residents and staff on Thursday welcomed former White House strategist Sebastian Gorka to New Beginnings, a halfway house for fired Trump administration members. The 20-bed residential treatment center, which opened earlier this year in the capital’s quiet Woodland Park neighborhood, reportedly offers round-the-clock care to traumatized former West Wing insiders, providing life skills training, wellness workshops, and psychotherapy under the guidance of licensed social workers. “At New Beginnings, Mr. Gorka will have the chance to make a fresh start—a chance to reflect on his past actions and hopefully emerge a more responsible citizen,” said director Ross Woodley, who noted that besides housing, the facility offered counseling on issues from anger management to speaking with special prosecutors. “No doubt he’s been through a lot, but he’ll be joining a community of other ex-Trump strategists, senior advisors, and communications personnel who are all going through the same process.” “It’s very lucky we were able to accommodate him, though, as we’ve been completely full since February,” he added. According to Woodley, once accepted to the program, a jittery, confused Gorka was driven from the White House directly to the facility to begin treatment. During the intake process, Gorka’s personal belongings were reportedly confiscated and he was asked to sign forms promising not to visit the Oval Office or have any contact with his enabling friends still within the administration. Sources said that Gorka, 46, has responded well to the facility’s regimented schedule, rising before dawn to brew coffee and make breakfast for the group with former communications director Michael Dubke. Additionally, sources noted that Gorka had bonded with long-term resident Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who showed him how to do his own laundry and helped him buy a bus pass so he could apply for dishwashing jobs around town. “It’s a good sign that he’s interacting with people—that’s more than we could say for Spicer or Priebus when they got here,” said Woodley, pointing to the two men quietly completing a 1,000-piece winter landscape jigsaw puzzle. “Sean was just a mess. One moment he’d be manically scrawling press releases on the backs of napkins, and the next he’d be screaming in your face, saying that CNN was out to destroy his reputation. Reince has been in and out of a catatonic stupor since he arrived.” “Yes, it’s true these guys got wrapped up with the wrong people, but I firmly believe everyone has value no matter badly they’ve screwed up their lives, or their family’s lives, or the lives of 314 million Americans,” he continued. According to Woodley, some of the biggest breakthroughs are made during group therapy where twice a day, former officials gather in the facility’s activity room to discuss tense moments working for the administration and how they might have handled them differently. He noted that while some residents reportedly take weeks to admit the things they’ve done, most eventually build up the courage to share their stories, often breaking down into sobs. Woodley also explained that all residents are required to follow a strict code of conduct: no drugs or alcohol, no guest appearances on cable news, and a tidy bunk at all times. According to staff, however, abiding by the rules has been especially tough for Steve Bannon, whose attempts to conduct Breitbart editorial meetings via a smuggled cell phone have led to his loss of commissary privileges. “Bannon is incredibly volatile, so we’ve had to put him on a 24/7 watch to ensure he doesn’t injure himself or others,” said Woodley, adding that the president’s former chief strategist had recently thrown an ashtray at a TV after watching a Fox News segment he considered “bullshit establishment propaganda.” “We thought maybe he’d turned a corner when he found a job as a busboy at a nearby pub, but then he lost it by referring to several waitresses as ‘dykes.’” While rehabilitation has been easier for some residents than others, Woodley said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was his biggest success story to date, noting that, after several weeks of intense rage counseling, he had fully accepted responsibility for his chaotic 10-day tenure and would soon be starting a new job at an Arlington landscaping company. “Though we wish for everyone to have the same level of success as Anthony, we accept it’s not always possible,” said Woodley. “There are only so many resources, and more and more people show up at our doorstep every day.” “Unfortunately, without our guidance, there’s really no future for these folks,” he continued. “People just don’t want Trump staffers living in their neighborhoods.” ",1,Sebastian Gorka Welcomed To Halfway House For Fired Trump Administration Members
"VATICAN CITY—After months of failed attempts to coax their sole mating pair into conceiving, officials from the Vatican City Zoo admitted Wednesday that they were unsure whether the facility would ever successfully breed an angel in captivity. The current effort is reportedly part of an ongoing campaign by the zoo, home to Christendom’s most diverse collection of holy fauna, to increase the world’s angelic population, which has dwindled to fewer than 400 heavenly creatures in the wild. “No systematic attempt to breed winged celestial beings outside their natural habitat in everlasting paradise has ever succeeded, so this is a daunting task,” said the zoo’s director Cardinal Lorenzo Menichelli, who explained that creating the ideal conditions for procreative intercourse would require theobiologists to learn more about angel fertility cycles and courtship rituals. “While there have been occasional signs of a potential pregnancy, such as elevated hormone levels or a dilated halo, each has unfortunately turned out to be a false alarm.” “Nevertheless, we still hope that one day we will welcome a new baby angel into our zoo’s Heavenly Messenger Pavilion,” he added. According to sources within the Holy See, zoo staff built an approximation of the angels’ natural habitat to facilitate breeding, installing sidewalks paved with gold throughout their concrete enclosure and a $300,000 motion-activated mist system to simulate clouds. Reports also confirmed that a special, secluded cage has been set up as far away as possible from the exhibit’s main viewing platform, which is often crowded with photo-snapping bishops and loud Sunday school children known to discourage angelic coition. However, despite the zoo’s best efforts, Menichelli said the male and female angels seldom show interest in each other, and on the rare occasions they do, the pair often becomes spooked prior to the act of copulation by sounds coming from the Leviathan and Behemoth cages in the nearby Hall of Beasts. The cardinal added that the problem is compounded by the fact that female angels are only in heat once every jubilee year. “We’ve tried numerous techniques to stimulate their libidinal urges—chanting devotional hymns, bestowing our blessings upon their loins, and bathing them in the shimmering light of God’s pure grace,” said Menichelli, adding that the zoo had recently ordered several gallons of highly pungent angel testosterone, which is known to induce estrus in reluctant females. “We even showed them video clips of other angels mating to activate their instinctual reproductive cues, but they refused to watch it and then began anxiously making the sign of the cross.” “Our experience has been quite different with the Nephilim, which breed like rabbits,” he continued, noting that the biblical race of giants had come a long way since the 19th century, when they were targeted by trophy hunters and nearly went extinct. “If we didn’t keep them isolated, we’d have a new litter every week.” Records indicate the zoo’s latest angelic breeding project follows a series of botched efforts dating back to the early 1970s. In a widely publicized 1984 incident, an attempt to mate two seraphim on loan from the Lourdes Zoo and Aquarium failed when the much larger and more aggressive male shouted, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole Earth is full of His glory!” and proceeded to tear the wings off the female, setting the program back by more than a decade. “Angel husbandry is a difficult process, but we’re not giving up,” Menichelli said. “These magnificent creatures are the most popular attraction at the zoo, apart from the Demon Pit and the Botanical Garden of Eden, and we’re committed to making it something that visitors to the Vatican can enjoy from now until the Second Coming.” Menichelli confirmed the zoo would try artificial insemination next, just as soon as it received the Church’s permission to collect a sample.

"WASHINGTON—Carrying on a longstanding tradition in which Republicans and Democrats come together, disrobe, and engage in a night of unbridled lust, all 535 members of the U.S. Congress reportedly set aside partisan differences Wednesday for their annual erotic masquerade ball. Senators and representatives said the hours-long celebration of carnal pleasure—customarily held in a candlelit, velvet-draped Capitol Rotunda where organ music plays and nude congressional aides distribute chalices of wine—gives them an opportunity to dispense with their political disputes for a night, don identity-obscuring feathered masks, and engage in all manner of lascivious acts. “Having this orgy every year is a great way to help us remember that, deep down, each of us shares the same primal urges,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), who stood clad in nothing but an elaborate Venetian mask and a leather crotchless thong as hundreds of naked lawmakers around him moaned, writhed, and thrusted upon ornate divans and sumptuous cushions arrayed on the rotunda’s polished stone floor. “I think we all look forward to putting on a cape or a corset or a harness and having one night to simply indulge in our colleagues’ flesh.” “The great Robert Byrd introduced this ritual more than half a century ago,” the 65-year-old, three-term senator continued. “He realized that, liberal or conservative, Eros possesses us all.” Sources on Capitol Hill said the erotic ball commenced when master of ceremonies Paul Ryan (R-WI), who held a candelabra and wore a tight-fitting Victorian waistcoat over his shirtless torso, announced that “the spell has been cast” and beckoned lawmakers to “heed the call of lechery.” A line of bound and blindfolded freshman senators then reportedly knelt down before John Trumbull’s circa 1818 painting  , chanted “Deus, patriam, et libidinem,” and began orally servicing senior senators belonging to the rival political party.  Witnesses confirmed, however, that one unidentified senator, a large flap of neck skin hanging loose beneath his zippered leather hood, merely observed and self-stimulated from off to the side, reportedly continuing to do so for the duration of the evening. “This is an act of renewal and celebration—a chance to get to know our fellow lawmakers better through purifying acts of debauchery,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), mere feet from where Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) clutched the legs of the marble statue of President James Garfield as a frenzied Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), wearing a glittering silver bandit’s mask, penetrated her from behind. “At this ball, we don’t argue about health care or taxes, and there are no Democrats or Republicans. There are only the unrepentant children of sin.” A woman wearing only a large, alabaster-white mask with a pronounced stork-like beak, identified by several in attendance as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), was later observed with her back propped against the base of the woman’s suffrage monument as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) simultaneously sucked on her breasts and took turns furiously masturbating her with their fingers. According to subsequent reports, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), 81, stripped off his mask, draped himself over a chaise longue, and screamed in ecstasy as Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), 60, dripped hot wax over his nipples, stomach, and genitals. “We have come to devour forbidden fruits together in a bacchanalia of depraved delight!” said a red-cloaked figure who displayed only his erect penis but was believed to be 83-year-old Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT). “We are the obscene, we are the reborn, we are the truly free. We are Americans.” At press time, the legislators had hastily abandoned the orgy in disgust after the House sergeant-at-arms, obliging the Texas senator’s request, began plunging his eagle-topped ceremonial mace in and out of Ted Cruz’s asshole.

"WASHINGTON—Warning that a successful launch would constitute a grave threat to American population centers from coast to coast, leading analysts confirmed Wednesday that South Korea is currently developing a new pop group capable of reaching the United States. Experts stated that significant South Korean resources have been dedicated to the project of creating an intercontinental, all-girl supergroup, with a team of highly skilled producers, vocal coaches, and choreographers working in hidden rehearsal facilities to devise a strategic pop phenomenon that, if fully deployed, could inflict widespread devastation. “Our analysis indicates this is an extremely powerful synth-driven bubblegum pop quintet—if it were to reach U.S. soil, the effects would be catastrophic for millions,” said Rita Bradley of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, referring to the group code-named TL-4125 but better known as SPLA$H in government circles. “Despite decades of warnings from the international community, South Korea has persisted in conducting tests of radio-ready vocals and hip-hop-inspired dance moves. Their development of highly infectious hooks has also continued apace over the years.” “We’re far more vulnerable than we realize,” she added. “This country isn’t prepared at all for a full-scale album release.” Top-secret meetings were reportedly held this week after intelligence officials learned South Korea now possesses the drum machine technology necessary to synthesize a fully danceable breakbeat, a key step in the process of launching a tactical international debut single. Sound check footage obtained by the CIA suggests that the group has reached a far more advanced stage of development than previously thought and could mobilize for a world tour as soon as 2018. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official told reporters that satellite imagery has revealed what appears to be an arena-sized stage set, with state-of-the-art recording studio complexes nearby. The official also said a Korean camera crew has been deployed to the same area, suggesting that a music video is in the works and that targeting the American charts may be within reach even sooner than feared. Long viewed as solely a regional threat, South Korea began conducting tests with smaller acts such as SG Wannabe and Brown Eyed Girls in the mid-2000s, and the limited range of those groups led most experts to consider the country’s ambitions for a transpacific R&B-inflected musical sensation to be completely unrealistic. “They’ve had the capability to hit Japan for a while now, but this is the first time they will be able to launch five singing-and-dancing pop idols in matching see-through baby-doll dresses directly at our shores,” said Douglas Reisenthaler, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. “The American populace is at risk of being exposed to their neon-dyed hair and cutesy uptempo electropop, the impact of which would be horrifying, especially if they were to drop a 15-track album without any prior warning. To be honest, this is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night—especially as a parent.” “If the information we have is accurate, they are mere months away from having their first smash hit,” he added. According to sources, South Korean scientists were recently able to overcome long-standing problems controlling the highly unstable, potentially explosive chemistry between group members Q.U.E.E.N. Hyeung, Sunshine, Min-ji, DiA, and Stephanie. Officials in Seoul have reportedly discussed demonstrating their capabilities on state television with a 60-second promotional teaser from a music video that, were it to trend, would all but ensure total ruin on a continental scale. Federal officials have said the South Koreans still lack a vocal processor powerful enough to enrich SPLA$H’s tracks with sufficient levels of Auto-Tune. In an effort to stymie their progress, the U.S. government imposes heavy economic sanctions against the nation’s record industry, and it is believed to have conducted cyberattacks to corrupt files containing master tracks and lyrics. Highly placed sources confirmed officials have not ruled out the possibility of a preemptive attack before the teenage pop group’s first concert. “For decades, our popular music has been able to reach their country, and so South Koreans believe it is only fair they be allowed to possess such a deterrent themselves,” Bradley said. “American leaders have turned a blind eye toward this situation for years, and now there’s nothing we can do but attempt to delay it as long as possible. As soon as they figure out how to match an irresistible electronic groove with a flashy signature dance move, that’s it.” She added, “The second you hear that beat drop—boom—it’s already over.” ",1,Report: South Korea Developing New Pop Group Capable Of Reaching U.S.
"HUDSON, NY—Saying he felt compelled to personally respond to the actions of a president he views as vicious and corrupt, local dipshit Scott Rudnick announced Thursday his intention to fight the Trump administration through his art. The 42-year-old dumbass, who has reportedly sketched out ideas for more than two dozen artistic projects addressing issues of a highly topical nature, stated that he will stand up to the presidency of Donald Trump by employing a mix of visual and performance-based media, as well as literature and song. “As an artist, I can’t sit idly by—when you see something like this happening in the world, you have to act,” said the complete moron, whose most recent efforts include a series in which Trump’s likeness is incorporated into Soviet-era propaganda posters and a prose poem condemning the president’s decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in the armed forces. “I’m fortunate enough to have been blessed with artistic talents, and it’s my responsibility to make good use of them, putting the screws to Trump at every turn.” “I’m particularly excited about this new screenplay I’ve just started,” he continued. “The working title is  ”  As he showed reporters various finished works displayed in his garage, the hopeless dipshit pointed out a driftwood sculpture called  , which he described as his “definitive rebuttal” to the president’s travel ban. The breathtaking idiot observed that he had “hit Trump hard” over the past few months with a looped video in which a perpetually overflowing glass of water is used to signify the flooding that climate change will bring, as well as a charcoal drawing in which a giant Betsy DeVos shakes an upturned schoolhouse and sends the children inside tumbling into a prison. The dumbfuck, who said he has recently been inspired to take on more ambitious projects that will “reveal this administration’s treachery for all the world to see,” noted that he was particularly excited about an upcoming “Resistance Cabaret” that he is arranging with several of his equally stupid friends. According to the colossal dope, the evening of music, dance, and short theatrical pieces will conclude with the performers duct-taping their mouths shut and wearing the names of GOP lawmakers on signs around their necks to send a “powerful message” to Republicans complicit in Trump’s agenda. The audience for the event, scheduled to take place in the back room of a local coffee shop next Tuesday from 4 to 6 p.m., is expected to include some of the most prominent idiots in the community. “It is imperative we find new ways to keep up the pressure on this White House,” said the insufferable jackass, telling reporters that his planned 12-minute movement piece featuring marionettes and set to Gary Jules’ “Mad World” would “shine a blinding light” on the current occupant of the Oval Office. “When the piece reaches its climax, and I literally cut Trump’s strings so he’s just lying there in a heap, I’ll be striking a blow at the very heart of all that this terrible man and his cronies represent.” “I’ll never stop fighting,” he added. At press time, the dummy had reportedly purchased a set of Russian nesting dolls and was labeling each piece with a different word, such as “lies,” “collusion,” and “cover-up.” ",1,Local Dipshit Planning On Fighting Trump Administration Through Art
"WASHINGTON—In response to a decline in revenue from routes running between the two disparate planes of existence, Amtrak announced Friday that it plans to cancel the mysterious, mist-enshrouded trains offering late-night service into the darkest realms of the spirit. The trains, which according to Amtrak timetables leave once daily at the stroke of midnight, their headlamps cutting through thick tendrils of billowing fog as they travel nonstop to points along their accursed route, will cease all operations September 1 as part of an effort to better allocate resources. “The cost-cutting measures we’ve introduced today include the termination of service to all stops between Amtrak terminals and the domain of shadows that drives men to complete and utter madness,” CEO Charles Moorman told reporters during a press conference. “The fuel required for these long journeys to ominous and inexplicable destinations within the spirit realm greatly increases our operating costs, as does the need to staff each car with the ghosts of our passenger’s deceased relatives.” “Service will continue through the end of the month,” he added. “At that point, any pained, restless mortals unable to find a moment of solace since the horrible accident on the eve of their wedding will have to make other travel arrangements.” According to financial records, the Hereafter Regional Line, which originates in a faint hazy glow in the distance and makes stops along the void bridging the worlds of the living and the dead, has been operating at a loss since the early 2000s. Though its service has been curtailed over the years, the train’s stops have been known to include a deserted station at which a faceless man in a frock coat waits to board, a perfectly still moonlit lake, a manor house in which the motionless silhouette of a young woman can be seen in the only lighted window, and a gaping chasm from which one can hear the tortured screams of the damned. Officials confirmed they had been unsuccessful with a recent fiscal plan to rein in expenses by running fewer trains during solstices and on the anniversary of the ill-fated night all those years ago when one’s life went horribly, horribly wrong. Compounding the line’s economic woes are its aging 19th-century locomotives, which reportedly require constant maintenance in order to continue barreling down the tracks at ever faster speeds while the banshee’s screech of metal upon metal echoes the wails of the accursed souls onboard. Sources added that the track, portions of which curve around forgotten graveyards with half-uprooted tombstones or corkscrew straight up into the night sky, cannot easily be shared by other Amtrak lines, leaving the track largely unused and unprofitable during daylight hours. “These days, a lot fewer people are being drawn into an abandoned rail yard by the beguiling whisper of their lost loves only to find themselves emerging into a flickering phantasm of Grand Central Station in the 1940s,” said Moorman, noting that Amtrak had struggled to shift from a rider base of spectral gangsters and Civil War soldiers reliving their final moments on earth to millennials. “Unfortunately, that means this service will no longer be available to customers on their way to meet the hollow-eyed ferryman who, if you cross his palm with silver, will take you on harrowing journeys that pierce the veil of death, but that’s a reality we have to face.” “Often there won’t be a single person waiting on the platform when our conductors shamble off the train and hold their lanterns aloft in long, skeletal fingers,” he continued. “So clearly our current approach isn’t working.” While Moorman acknowledged that canceling the routes would inconvenience many otherworld commuters, he said Amtrak planned to ease the transition by running a shuttle service to and from the land of everlasting torment through November. He went on to state that customers who had exchanged their most cherished memory for a ticket on the now-defunct line would receive full credit for their fond reminiscence and be allowed to apply it to the fare of any other Amtrak route.

"OAK PARK, IL—Saying he hoped the revelation wouldn’t dampen their enthusiasm for the house, realtor Bill Cylkowski informed a couple of potential buyers Thursday that he was obligated to tell them about the murder currently happening in the basement. “Just to let you guys know, I do have to mention that there are four people being killed downstairs right now,” said Cylkowski, adding that he was fully aware that some might consider the in-progress quadruple homicide a deal-breaker. “I know you really love this place, but I wouldn’t be doing my job if I wasn’t forthright about the horrifying tragedy underway at this very moment. I can assure you, however, that the shrieking and pleas for mercy will be complete by your move-in date unless the victims are going to be unexpectedly tortured to death over several weeks.” At press time, Cylkowski was telling the couple that the neighborhood was near some excellent schools and that the previous owners actually had two children roughly the same age as theirs.

"TUCUMCARI, NM—Greeting the extraterrestrial diplomat at their usual rendezvous point atop an isolated mesa in the High Plains of eastern New Mexico, Dyson Ltd CEO James Dyson reportedly met in secret with an alien ambassador from the Zartrepylon star system to receive the latest technology for a new hand dryer Thursday night. “I bring you our newest design, the Cyclinox, the most powerful hand dryer in the Virgo Supercluster,” said Ambassador Ahololoax, Intergalactic Minister of the Phylexor Dominion, handing the businessman the new wall-mounted device while explaining how it used an advanced system of fans beyond human comprehension to blow a concentrated sheet of air 1.8 times faster and with 70 percent more energy efficiency than any primitive earthling hand dryer technology. “Our kingdom has the driest hands in all the galaxy. It would take 500 of your Earth years for your species to even begin developing the airblade technology needed to eliminate moisture with such speed and hygiene, but alas, we bestow it upon you to spread to your people and further the progress of your race.” Before leaving, the ambassador reportedly told Dyson he would return with his kind’s latest vacuum cleaner whenever he felt humanity could properly handle such powerful cyclonic suction.

"WOODLAWN, MD—Arriving en masse to the Pacific island nation after fleeing under the cover of night, 76 million baby boomers reportedly escaped to Fiji on Friday after completely draining the nation’s Social Security and Medicare accounts. Sources said the daring $3.1 trillion operation was discovered early this morning as stunned federal employees checked both programs’ reserves only to find that each now held a total of $0.00, the apparent culmination of a plan that reportedly was meticulously organized and executed over the last 30 years. “It’s gone, all gone, they completely cleaned us out,” said Social Security director Nancy Berryhill, revealing that airport security cameras had caught every American born between 1946 and 1964, having emptied the U.S. social safety net, boarding red-eye flights to Fiji. “These people were using our nation’s wealth as their personal piggy bank for decades, just waiting for the right moment to make their move and take us for everything we were worth.” “The way they acted so sweet all these years—how could we not see this coming?” she added. “Those selfish sons of bitches were working us the whole time!” According to sources, the entirety of Medicare and Social Security was slowly siphoned off as the post-war generation built trust by assuring the other 240 million Americans that they would collect their share eventually. However, since decamping, observers say the baby boomers have spent the funds on opulent lifestyles in the tropics where they intend to live out the rest of their days relaxing in comfort, all at the expense of the children and grandchildren they reportedly claimed to be concerned about. “We thought they were our friends, neighbors, and loved ones, but clearly they’ve just been enriching their own coffers for years,” said Berryhill, adding that it was now apparent that despite their “inspirational hot air” about investing in the country’s future, the baby boomers only really cared about themselves. “As we speak, they’re probably cruising along in their European sports cars to the beachfront condos they bought with   money, laughing at how naïve we all were.” “And we fell for their scheme,” she continued. “How could we have been so foolish?” As they awoke to find the baby boomers gone, shocked citizens from around the country were forced to contemplate how, and even if, they could ever replace the funds they had been counting on for their own healthcare and retirement income. Speaking to reporters, many expressed anger and disbelief that their hard-earned money would be used to pay not for their own basic living expenses, but instead for expensive new wardrobes, luxury hotel suites, and sunset champagne cruises to private Fijian lagoons. “In retrospect it now seems obvious why they were skimming off a little piece of my paycheck every month,” said Roland Jensen of Rochester, MN, noting how his town was left strewn with abandoned homes, each containing notes hastily taped to front doors that simply read “Thanks for everything—xoxo.” “They always did think they were better than us, that their generation was somehow special. And now those bastards are an ocean away enjoying their perfect tropical paradise while we’re left footing the bill.” “We may never recover after what they did to this country,” he added.

"MINNEAPOLIS—His mouth going dry and his palms growing sweaty as he arrived at the offices of Regent Advertising Partners to interview for an open account manager position, local man Devin McKee reportedly prayed Thursday that the hiring manager wouldn’t ask him any questions during their meeting. “Oh man, giving answers was the one thing I didn’t prepare for—if they ask me something, I’ll be so screwed,” McKee reportedly thought to himself, his heart beginning to race faster as he imagined how he would likely freeze up or flounder around in panic if his interviewer put him on the spot with a question of any kind. “Okay, okay, calm down. All you need is for them to keep speaking for the entire 30 minutes without expecting you to respond in any way—then you should be fine.

"BOLINGBROOK, IL—Explaining that seeking professional psychological help was a big scam when there were better, cheaper alternatives, local man Justin Treanor told reporters Monday that he doesn’t understand why people waste money on a therapist when they could just emotionally crush their girlfriend. “A therapist can cost hundreds of dollars for just one session, but taking your problems out on the one who loves you is free,” said Treanor, adding that his romantic partner was always there when he needed to work things out by destroying her spirit, while scheduling an appointment with a therapist was time-consuming and could take weeks. “Why wait a month and possibly have to take time off of work to see a counselor when my girl is already right there to belittle and blame at home? Besides, if I’m going to confront my demons, I’d rather have someone I know and trust to lash out at.” Treanor added that he knew it was the right decision when he experienced a recent breakthrough that resulted in his girlfriend crying herself to sleep.

"NEW YORK—Saying the ghastly imitations were sadly not entirely surprising, sources told reporters Tuesday that a widely viewed documentary about a brutal murder had inspired a string of numerous copycat documentaries. “It’s a phenomenon we unfortunately observe from time to time: producers see that a certain true-crime doc is getting attention and then try to replicate it in hopes they’ll get some of the spotlight too,” said critic Lauren Frye, noting that the many copycats of   all feature hallmarks of the original, including a small town, a murdered teenage girl, speculations about mishandled evidence, and home videos of the suspected killer as a child. “It’s absolutely sickening. We in the media have a responsibility to stop sensationalizing these derivative works with our coverage, because that’s exactly what the horrifying people who make them crave. The best thing we all can do is simply look away.” Frye went on to say that while copycat documentaries couldn’t be prevented altogether, fewer would be produced if people knew they’d have to upload it themselves to YouTube and hope even a hundred people watched.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the method yields positive results almost immediately, a coalition of leading therapists said Thursday that most of the personal issues people experience could be resolved if they would simply stop being so weird all the time. On issues ranging from relationship problems and feelings of anxiety to more specific concerns like stress in the workplace and self-consciousness in social situations, the mental health experts asserted that not acting weird about every little thing could prove hugely beneficial for millions, in many cases eliminating their problems altogether. “Clients come in to talk to me about things in their lives that are making them unhappy, and nine times out of 10 they could resolve the issue just by not being such a weirdo,” said Dallas-area psychotherapist Jesse DeStefano, adding that everyone has a choice whether to go through life as a total freak or not, and that those who don’t are healthier and more productive. “The process is very simple. When you start thinking about something weird—at work, at home, on a date—stop doing that and think about normal things instead. It’s really quite easy.” “Once you start focusing on normal stuff, you’ll find the situation improves instantly,” he continued. Asked to elaborate on this method, DeStefano said it could be broken down into three simple steps: Recognize that most people don’t act the way you do, ask yourself what a regular person would do in your situation, and then do that. According to the therapist, people could save themselves a lot of trouble if they would follow this approach before they open their mouths and start to say something that makes them sound completely wacko. He added that by not being weird it was possible to lead a happier and more fulfilled life, noting that everyone will see you as normal person because you will be acting like a normal person. “Look, whatever issues you may have, your best bet is to get up, go outside, and stop behaving weirdly,” said Eva Perlmutter, a clinical psychologist who practices in Boston. “I could talk all day about negative thought patterns, social dynamics, and interpersonal skills, but honestly, you’d be better off taking a good look around and observing how the vast majority of other people just act normal. Seriously, they’re pretty much all around you.” “I really don’t know what else to tell you,” she added. “If you’re having weird thoughts, then don’t have them anymore.” She went on to ask why, if people have things that are bothering them, they would ever think that being all weird about it could possibly help. “Just don’t be a freak, especially when you’re around other people,” DeStefano said. “Don’t be a freak around your friends, your family, your coworkers—and certainly don’t be a freak around people you’ve just met. It’s not even a good idea to be a freak in front of your therapist.” “Seriously, do you have any idea how weird it is to pay someone to listen to you talk about your problems?” he continued. “That’s probably the weirdest part of all.” ",1,Nation’s Therapists Say Majority Of Issues Could Be Resolved By Not Being So Weird All The Time
"FRAMINGHAM, MA—Hoping to capture the “unique essence” of its discount retail stores for online customers, T.J. Maxx unveiled a new website Wednesday that recreates its in-person shopping experience with a selection of miscellaneous products haphazardly strewn everywhere. Company CEO Ernie Herrman told reporters that the site—which features a disorganized jumble of closeout name-brand apparel and home fashions alongside a random inventory of neck pillows, pill organizers, cocktail olives, and dozens of other items—would provide users with the same sense of disorientation that regularly overwhelms shoppers at the chain’s nearly 1,200 brick-and-mortar locations. “When you visit TJMaxx.com, you’ll immediately be presented with an assortment of surplus clothing available exclusively in sizes that don’t fit you, just as you would if you actually walked into one of our stores,” said Herrman, explaining that all merchandise on the website has three to five different prices attached to it, or else no visible price at all. “Select ‘shoes’ from the drop-down menu, and you’ll see scores of the same pair of Dolce Vita pumps, a variety of sneaker styles for which only the left shoe is available, some Tupperware without lids, and the occasional ceramic owl.” He added, “Longtime T.J. Maxx customers should feel right at home when they visit us online.” For their overhaul of the website, company officials confirmed they had included thousands of new high-definition photos so users can zoom in on products such as fingerprint-smudged pint glasses; already-opened packets of decorative napkins; irregular garments with jagged, misaligned seams; and handbags with their straps hopelessly tangled in a hair-dryer cord. According to reports, online customers will also discover a completely redesigned maternity wear section, which when clicked upon appears to consist of nothing but a single pig-shaped charcuterie board. In addition, the site automatically redirects users through several pages of off-brand multicolored iPhone chargers and dusty caramel corn tins before they reach checkout, at which point they reportedly may complete their transaction, paying a price entirely different from what was listed. Herrman also noted that web users requiring assistance can avail themselves of a customer support chat box, where, in real-time, a T.J. Maxx employee will answer any questions one asks with a terse “I don’t know” and then promptly log out, ignoring any further inquiries. “If you’re a regular at our stores, you’ll find exactly what you’ve come to expect from T.J. Maxx when you visit our website: girls’ bathing suits located right next to the salad spinners in the kitchen section, and stud-loop leather belts pretty much everywhere,” Herrman said. “And if you’ve never been to a T.J. Maxx before, then log on and stock up on everything from throw pillows embroidered with inspirational messages to copies of   with the cover torn off.” “We’re proud to serve anyone who’s willing to click on the page for our luggage department and spend a couple of minutes staring in bewilderment at a 2-foot-tall wooden ‘S’ accompanied by no identifying information whatsoever,” he continued. At press time, visitors to TJMaxx.com could also browse a seasonal Halloween section that featured a jack-o-lantern cookie jar with a visible seven-inch crack, an arctic camo chain wallet, and loose pieces from a magnetic travel checkerboard.

Of course, wide-scale assassination attempts are never acceptable, and it’s a real shame that a pretty awesome dude wasn’t able to pump the brakes slightly more.” Kilmeade urged viewers to take Soyec’s zealousness as an inspiration, but warned them to “dial it down a smidge.” ",1,‘Fox & Friends’ Denounces Bombing Suspect As Overenthusiastic Fan Whose Heart Basically In Right Place

While there will inevitably be delays during the upcoming renovations, the result will be the most clean, efficient, and consistent sex criminals New York has ever seen.” Lhota excitedly added that the plan was expected to make the subway riding experience 75 percent less safe for women.

"WASHINGTON—In a gesture of encouragement toward the millions of Americans struggling to find work in a difficult job market, the U.S. Department of Labor told employment seekers today not to forget about the tons of dumbfucks out there. Speaking at a morning press conference, department officials stressed that while there are still many more job applicants than job openings, those in need of work should take comfort in the knowledge that the pool of available labor in the United States includes all kinds of dimwits, morons, and complete fucking imbeciles. “If you’re unemployed and applying for work, it’s important to remember that most of the candidates you’re up against are stupid as shit,” said Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, urging out-of-work Americans to stop a moment and consider just how many of their fellow citizens are drooling idiots who don’t have a goddamn clue about anything. “However frustrated you feel about your job prospects, understand that there’s a vast, grossly incompetent segment of the population you don’t have to worry about at all. If you show up on time with your shirt buttoned, you’re already doing far better than most everyone else.” “Seriously, of all the people applying for all the available positions in the country right now, only about 50 or so actually have any idea what they’re doing,” Perez continued. “Those are the ones you’re really competing with. The rest are pretty much all dipshits.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, these clueless dopes can be found among candidates for every entry-level, managerial, and executive position throughout the public and private sectors. Recent data indicate that eight in 10 people interviewing for any given job reportedly spend the entire time staring blankly at the prospective employer, their mouth hanging open as they nod or shake their head in response to questions. For every qualified applicant to a given job, the bureau’s statisticians found there are 37 dummies who fail to meet even one requirement for the position, 28 who can’t write a simple cover letter without sounding totally illiterate, and 15 who have to call multiple times on their way to the interview because they keep getting lost. Data suggest only a handful of American job seekers can make it through a 10-minute phone interview without gibbering like a brainless halfwit who has no idea what time of the day it is or why anyone has called them in the first place. “If you can attach a résumé to an email, you’re already in the 90th percentile of applicants in the U.S. workforce,” said Stacey Hines, a human resources executive at General Electric, citing the number of thick-witted job seekers who forget to include the document with their message and then immediately send a harried follow-up email in which they fail to send it once more. “Half of these things we throw in the trash immediately because some total dumbass has spelled the contact person’s name three different ways.” Hines, who has spent more than three decades as a hiring manager for major companies, told reporters that it is rare to find a candidate who can form a halfway-coherent sentence that communicates a point and doesn’t trail off into a list of mumbled office jargon or stop abruptly for no apparent reason. “As long as you’re not some slack-jawed pea brain who shows up with barbecue sauce smeared along the corner of your mouth, and the first words out of your mouth aren’t ‘How soon can I get paid?’ you’ll probably do just fine,” she said. “Just this morning, I had five big old dumbfucks outside my office who each thought they had an appointment at 9 a.m., so I interviewed all of them together just to get them out of the way.” Labor economists confirmed the real problem facing unemployed Americans is the staggering number of giant assholes out there, since they’re the ones who always wind up getting the best-paying jobs.

"VATICAN CITY—Describing the groundbreaking work as a major step forward for theological research, a team of Vatican geneticists held a press conference Tuesday at the Apostolic Palace to announce they had successfully cloned God. The team of ordained scientists from the Catholic Church’s Order of Holy Genomics confirmed they had, after decades of concerted effort and numerous failed attempts, finally succeeded in creating a genetically identical copy of the Almighty. The newborn God clone #8RR19, which the team has nicknamed “Marvin,” has reportedly survived for over seven weeks since emerging from an incubation vat in the basement laboratory of St. Peter’s Basilica. “By artificially producing a fully functional God who possesses all of the divine traits of the original, we now have the ability to conduct hands-on research on the Lord,” said Father Giancarlo Bertinotti, who first conceived of fertilizing a Supreme Being embryo by extracting sublime DNA from a skin cell of the Hand of God and injecting the holy genetic material into a donor egg cell. “It may now be possible to answer some of our greatest questions about our Creator, such as whether there are any observable boundaries of His love, if He is incapable of forgiving certain sins, and how exactly He comes to dwell inside all of us.” “This breakthrough marks a new chapter in our quest to quantify precisely how great and good God is,” Bertinotti continued. According to team leaders, the experimental project to recreate God first achieved success in 1995, when researchers cloned a cherub, the least complex of all Heavenly forms. During the winter of 2004, the team is said to have finally succeeded in growing a cluster of divinely radiant cells in a petri dish, a research milestone that helped secure the additional Vatican funding required to proceed to the final stage of bringing a cloned God to life. The newborn Marvin, who has reportedly only grown to one one-hundredth the size of a fully adult God, is the 31st fertilized embryo created by the lab, but just the first clone to survive past the first week of infancy. Recalling the long and frustrating period of trial and error involved in the cloning process, the scientists noted that the initial Gods that were created suffered from a variety of health and developmental problems, such as an inability to see all things, difficulty passing divine judgment, full-body hairlessness, and fallibility. The scientists reported they were especially pleased to see Marvin had developed infinite benevolence unlike His predecessor from 2009, Tom III, whose excessive wrath threatened to destroy the entire universe until the geneticists resorted to euthanization. “Based on our medical evaluations, we believe Marvin can expect to enjoy a healthy, holy life for all of eternity,” said Bertinotti, who added that the exact genetic copy of God was currently being monitored in a secured habitat enclosure designed to replicate the natural, blissful conditions of His Divine Kingdom. “Early performance tests suggest that He possesses complete omniscience, and even at this early age, we have observed Him beginning to transcend space and time, something none of our previous specimens came close to achieving.” “Furthermore, repeated testing suggests that His ability to create something where there was once nothing matches the performance benchmarks of our original God of Heaven,” Bertinotti continued. Despite numerous clinical trials, scientists conceded that Marvin has yet to successfully impregnate a virgin woman, leaving open the possibility that the clone specimen is sterile. “Now that we have successfully cloned God, the possibilities are truly endless,” said Bertinotti, suggesting the Church may choose to grow a supply of usable divine internal organs as potential replacements should God’s ever begin to fail. “Our new technique also provides us with the power to recreate God should the naturally occurring population of our Heavenly Father ever go extinct.” “I can also say that going forward, we hope to explore whether gene therapy could inhibit God’s intense feelings of jealousy and finally control his urges to smite,” Bertinotti continued.

"LANGHORNE, PA—Saying that she could sense Satan within them the moment they walked through the door, Sunday school teacher Elizabeth Reath told reporters this weekend that she could already tell which of her students at First Baptist Church of Langhorne were going to Hell. “At this point in my career, I can tell just by looking at them which ones will be saved and which ones will be damned to burn in fire and brimstone for all eternity,” said Reath, emphasizing that within minutes of getting to know each of her 20 students, she had already isolated the 8-year-olds who had been marked by the Devil and had “placed her bets” on the ones that seemed destined to be banished to the Inferno later in life. “By the time they get to me, it’s way past the point where I can just pray for them and save them from their final judgment day. I mean, half the kids in this class have had at least one parent who will end up in Hell.

"VATICAN CITY—In an effort to strengthen their relationship and foster interfaith dialogue, Pope Francis reportedly welcomed the winged Mayan snake god Kukulkan to the Vatican this week as part of a month-long deity exchange program. “We are excited to have the War Serpent staying here with us for the next four weeks, during which time he’ll be exposed to the rituals and customs of the Catholic Church, so that when he returns home he can share the experience with his adherents in Chichén Itzá and the surrounding Yucután communities,” said Vatican spokesperson Greg Burke, noting that the pontiff had taken Kukulkan out for pizza on the first night of the exchange before showing him around some of Rome’s most famous landmarks. “Once Kukulkan gets settled in, the pope plans to let him answer some basic prayers on his own, as well as try performing a transubstantiation or two. And perhaps toward the end of his stay, if he’s feeling up to it, Kukulkan can treat us all to an authentic human sacrifice.” Vatican sources confirmed that as part of the exchange, God Almighty, Our Heavenly Father, would be spending the next month with the Taoist thunder god Lei Gong in the cloud kingdom over Tibet.

My first prototype had like five heads and wasn’t even bipedal, but Kryzok brilliantly streamlined everything and shaped it into the product everyone knows and loves today.” Noting that His collaborator also had a great sense of humor and was always pulling pranks, God went on to say that the idea for the human excretory system actually began as a long-running inside joke between the two friends.

"STANFORD, CA—Researchers from Stanford University published the results of an alarming report Tuesday that confirmed the average American spends roughly 25 percent of their life waiting in line at a cell phone store. “Our analysis found that most people spend about 20 to 25 years of their lives waiting to be helped by the next free employee behind a cell phone store counter, often attempting to amuse themselves by looking across the room at the selection of cell phone cases or half-heartedly watching whatever is playing on the store’s television,” said lead researcher Kim Flores, explaining that by including the amount of time Americans spent seated in a chair in the store’s waiting room, the number would increase to over 40 percent of one’s life span. “We certainly didn’t think it was possible, but the numbers don’t lie. Countless people have lost many years of their lives, missing important events such as loved ones’ birthdays, weddings, and funerals to instead stand in line behind five to six other customers. It’s unfortunate, but true.” Flores also confirmed that, at the time of the report, over 400 Americans had died while standing in line.

Plus, we were so preoccupied with how to ensure that his death was painful that we weren’t spending any time plotting how to cause the most horrendous massacres possible, allowing scores of Yemenis attending weddings or traveling on school field trips to survive. Our focus on killing Mr. Khashoggi has granted hundreds of Yemenis the gift of life.” The crown prince added that the Saudis were prepared to save the lives of even more Yemenis if they could reallocate their resources to inflict mass starvation and a cholera epidemic on a few dissident journalists instead.

"MONTGOMERY, AL—Waving off the current allegations against him as vicious attempts to sabotage his election bid, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore told reporters Monday that the women accusing him of pedophilia were only doing so now because “shifting sociocultural norms have created an environment in which assault allegations are taken seriously.” “These women have had 30 years to come forward, and the one and only reason they’re speaking out now is because they suddenly have less fear that their lives will be utterly destroyed,” said Moore, adding that the women accusing him of sexually pursuing them as teenagers were just several of many “jumping on the sexual assault bandwagon these days” in light of meaningful systemic change and the fact that society would no longer immediately discredit them. “My accusers are nothing but slandering opportunists taking advantage of the deteriorating influence of the patriarchy that has traditionally silenced any woman who makes such claims. If the American public at large had not finally begun truly hearing victims and decided that enough was enough, I guarantee that these women would never have had the audacity to accuse me of such heinous crimes.” Moore went on to say that he would nevertheless continue his run for the Senate despite the charges against him because while the norms had shifted, they had not shifted nearly as much in Alabama.

"MAKALU, NEPAL—After uncovering four corpses buried in snow along an icy mountain ridge, members of an Estée Lauder expedition said Thursday they had found the remains of a party lost decades ago while searching for a unique moisturizing herb thought to grow deep in the Himalayas. The explorers, now three weeks into their ascent of a nearly 27,000-foot peak, radioed back to their base camp when they came upon the grim scene, reportedly all that is left of a failed 1961 Lauder expedition that sought to obtain samples of the rare herb, which is said to possess anti-aging properties so powerful it can instantly rejuvenate the driest and most wrinkled skin. “We discovered four human bodies completely encrusted in a thick layer of ice, as well as a campsite littered with oxygen tanks, broken ice picks, and empty tins of lip balm,” said Clara Faherty, head of the current expedition, who confirmed that one of the bodies belonged to Franklin Ames, the American beautician who led the 1961 group and had previously discovered an essential oil in the Amazon rainforest that eliminates split ends. “The freezing cold had turned their faces, twisted in agony, to an almost pure white. Ames himself appeared to have been crawling on his hands and knees, reaching out his hand in a final attempt to grab the legendary nourishing and revitalizing plant that was just beyond his fingertips.” “Tragically, they all froze to death just a few feet away from the secret to beautiful, radiant skin,” she added. According to historians, attempts to locate the fabled herb date back to the early 20th century, when a British explorer discovered a remote Himalayan village where the inhabitants possessed a strange, otherworldly glow and appeared to maintain completely smooth and blemish-free skin well into old age. For years, experts considered the existence of a plant that purified and refreshed skin while visibly reducing pores to be mere legend, but then in 1953, a Neutrogena executive visited a Kathmandu market and purchased a mysterious herbal extract that could instantly erase wrinkles and lines in ways never before seen by Western cosmetologists. Company records indicate that skin-care companies such as L’Oréal, Olay, and Jergens soon began to scour mountainsides from Kashmir to Tibet in search of the herb. Of these efforts, the Lauder expedition of ’61 was the most famous, with stories persisting that Ames and his team had succeeded but never returned—a rumor fueled by local tales of a group of white men with clear and vibrant skin who lived in a nearby village and didn’t look a day over 30. Faherty said she was able to confirm the four dead bodies were from the lost expedition after she discovered Ames’ diary in an ice-encrusted knapsack at the campsite. “The last entries suggest one man abandoned the group and walked off into a blizzard after he developed hideous bags under his eyes, while several others went mad and turned on each other after they ran out of hand lotion,” said Faherty, describing Ames’ account of crazed men who started a brawl during which half of their meager food and exfoliating rations fell into a crevasse and were lost. “Things got so desperate they began trying to hydrate their skin with snow, which we now know just ends up leaving you even more dry and cracked than before. The conditions must have been unbearable.” “One of the corpses had his fingertips frozen to his face, as if he were still trying to moisturize, even in death,” Faherty added. The current Estée Lauder team reported that they were able to gather several small samples of the storied herb to bring back home, and were hoping it would live up to its ability to draw out built-up impurities and liven up lackluster skin. However, Faherty acknowledged she had developed some concerns about unlocking the plant’s mythical age-defying powers. “The longer I’m in these mountains, the more I wonder if perhaps mankind was never meant to possess such perfectly firm and supple skin,” she said, noting that the native name of the ridge where the herb was found could be roughly translated as “land of silky smooth skin and death.” “This is the holy grail of cosmetics. But what if its powers, which we still don’t understand, come at a horrible price?” At press time, sources confirmed that all members Faherty’s party had vanished without a trace and were presumed dead, having last been heard over the radio threatening to murder each other over the last leaf of the rare, miraculous herb.

"BOSTON—Responding to the needs of thousands of long-deserted psychiatric facilities, condemned terminal-disease hospitals, and abandoned pre-war orphanages across the nation, General Electric has released a new line of flickering light bulbs for abandoned sanatoriums. “Installed thoughtfully at the sudden dead-end of a decaying corridor or swinging spasmodically over a cobweb-cloaked electric chair, our new Asylum™ bulbs will partially illuminate your decrepit medical facility with 10 times the eerie irregularity of ordinary incandescents,” a GE press release said of the line, which will be offered in Hypoxia Blue, Tubercular Yellow, and Revealing White, all of which will gutter, spark, and emit an almost painfully bright glare for one paralyzing moment before plunging customers into total darkness. “From the peeling-plaster dim of the solitary confinement annex to the half-glimpsed scuttling inpatient chambers, Asylum™ bulbs cast the perfect erratic light for any room in which a moldering wheelchair faces the corner and inexplicably rocks back and forth.” General Electric has confirmed that the bulbs will only be offered in 10 watts, ensuring that occupants of any given shadowy room will remain uncertain as to exactly where that breathing is coming from.

"WASHINGTON—Experiencing a rising sense of dread as he opened his eyes Friday morning and noticed the woman asleep beside him, a groggy and confused Vice President Mike Pence reportedly muttered, “Oh God, what happened last night?” upon waking up in the same bed as his wife. “This is Karen’s bed—what have I  ?” said a visibly panicked Pence, his fear increasing as he discovered that he was completely naked except for his underwear and pajama pants, while second lady Karen Pence wore no socks or nightcap, her feet and head completely nude. “We didn’t, did we? I mean, I don’t think we did, but I’m not a hundred percent sure. Oh, no, no, no. C’mon, Mike, what’s gotten into you? How could you be so reckless? What on earth were you thinking having that second glass of milk last night? You idiot! You better just hope you didn’t do anything you’ll regret.” At press time, sources reported the vice president was praying that no one would see him as he quietly snuck out of his wife’s bedroom and stumbled back to his own quarters, where he immediately showered in a futile attempt to wash away his shame.

"LANCASTER, PA—Observing that she is way ahead of other girls her age, sources close to precocious 4-year-old Tessa Davison confirmed Wednesday that she already feels completely terrible about herself. Davison’s parents and teachers told reporters the exceptional preschooler has already begun to think of herself as a completely worthless person who will never be as smart or likable as everyone else, a mindset, they were quick to point out, most girls don’t start developing until middle school. “Tessa isn’t even 5 yet, but she’ll spend hours worrying about the way she looks and whether other kids think she’s dumb—she’s way ahead of the curve with that stuff,” said Davison’s mother, Sarah, who noted that other children’s parents are often surprised by her daughter’s remarkable ability to see awful qualities in herself. “A lot of girls twice or even three times Tessa’s age aren’t even at that point. But then, she’s always seemed a bit more advanced, psychologically and emotionally, than her peers.” “Just last week, I saw Tessa watching TV, and she just naturally began comparing her appearance against the actresses and models she was watching—she picked that up instantly, all on her own,” she continued. “It really is something.” Though Davison only started paying close attention to her personal weaknesses recently, reports indicate the 4-year-old has nonetheless developed an extraordinary ability to stress out about the number of friends she has, the kinds of clothes she wears, and whether she is disappointing everyone else in her life, skills that typically take years for children to master. Moreover, Davison’s parents noted that their daughter is constantly developing astonishing new anxieties about herself every day. According to relatives, when Davison was only 3 years old, she was already using words like “repulsive” and “incompetent” to describe herself. A year later, they said, she routinely locks herself in her room and scrutinizes herself in front of a mirror, refusing to come out because she feels ugly. Sources speculated that at this rate, Davison will likely conclude she is an inherently unlovable human being whose opinions do not matter and who is wholly undeserving of affection as early as age 9 or 10, far earlier than most girls do. “The way she talks about how she’s no good at anything and therefore there’s no point in even trying, sometimes she sounds just like the high schoolers,” said Rachel Dunn, who teaches Davison’s prekindergarten class. “For example, when other kids on the playground invite her to play a game with them, she’s always too self-conscious to join in. And the other day, when she answered a question incorrectly, I heard her muttering to herself that she would never talk in class again because she felt like such an idiot.” “You don’t see many kids in pre-K capable of shaming themselves on a sixth-grade level the way Tessa does,” Dunn continued. According to child psychologists, Davison is indeed advanced in her emotional development, often talking quietly because she thinks her speaking voice sounds weird, or quitting activities she enjoys because she’s afraid she will embarrass herself. Studies show most girls don’t start throwing away half their lunch because they think they’re too fat until adolescence, but Davison is said to already be skipping snack time with regularity. Experts emphasized, however, that while Davison has a developmental head start on her peers right now, her classmates will still catch up to her eventually.  When reached for comment, Davison’s father, Kent, remarked that he was surprised by how quickly his young daughter was changing. “My little girl is growing up so fast,” he said. “She clearly takes after her mother.” ",1,Precocious 4-Year-Old Already Feels Terrible About Herself
"DECATUR, IL—Lamenting that his viewing experience was already ruined by reveals made in the preview, area man Adam Fredrikson told reporters Friday that he hates it when a trailer gives away the entire premise of a movie. “I’ll be pumped to see a new film, but once the title and basic dramatic conceit are revealed in the trailer, my anticipation is completely gone,” said Fredrikson, explaining that once he realized a film involved a love story between two main characters, took place during World War II, or had a director, it no longer seemed worth spending $14 and 90 minutes to see it. “For instance, I can already tell   is set in New York, because of that shot of the Empire State Building, and it’s super obvious from the voice-over that Amy Schumer is having problems with her self-image. Why would they do that? There are no surprises left.” Fredrikson added that he was also sick of recognizing the actors who appeared on screen during the feature, thus spoiling the credits.

"CHICAGO—Foot-care brand Dr. Scholl’s unveiled its new Freeze-Away Toe Remover Thursday, an over-the-counter treatment that combines freeze therapy with fast-acting liquid to loosen and ultimately expel unsightly toes. “If you’re finding it painful to put on shoes or simply want to get rid of the gnarled growths at the ends of your feet, there’s an easier solution than having your toes surgically removed—just apply our product on the affected area, and in 24 hours the digits will disappear,” said the company’s director of marketing Angie Diaz, who explained that the serum works by chemically breaking down tissue and bone before freezing and separating the phalanges from the metatarsals. “It’s a painless, no-hassle solution that will save you the time and expense of a trip to the doctor. And since each package comes with five doses, you can re-apply as many times as necessary to ensure a smooth, healthy surface.” Diaz added that the temporary loss of feeling in users’ feet could be alleviated by Dr. Scholl’s’ Hypodermic Massage Gel.

"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the updated procedure could prevent needless tragedies and save countless lives, officials from the National School Boards Association announced Thursday that new active-shooter drills would include practicing pleas to lawmakers to do something about this. “This new training exercise instructs students to lock classroom doors, barricade entry points, and then quietly use phones or other electronic devices to log into social media accounts and beg their elected representatives to take some sort of action,” said NSBA executive director Thomas J. Gentzel, adding that the new armed-assailant protocol trains students to practice using clear, direct, and plain language while imploring legislators to do their jobs and make this stop. “In a situation like this, every second counts, so it’s absolutely crucial for students to know where they should go online to frantically plead with lawmakers to act like compassionate human beings and do the right fucking thing for once in their lives.” At press time, Gentzel confirmed that the safest procedure would be for students to evacuate the country.

"BATON ROUGE, LA—In a discovery that may indicate the Jazz Age began thousands of years earlier than traditionally believed, a team of archaeologists from Louisiana State University announced Tuesday that they had unearthed a completely intact mastodon-ivory trumpet. “This horn is our first insight into the possible existence of hepcats who could really blow them horns 12,000 years before Buddy Bolden and Louis Armstrong,” said LSU’s Dr. Liana Brower, adding that wear patterns on the horn indicated that Pleistocene cool cats were indeed cutting loose with those hot sweet swing licks before the invention of the wheel. “While it’s too early to be certain, it’s quite possible these jazz daddies from way back first laid down the sweet sounds that evolved into our own bip-boz-dee-boze dee-bop-biddly-bop and push-ka-pee-she-pie.” Brower cautioned that the archaeological dig was in its early stages, dig, but the discovery of more horns, or even a saxophone, would testify to one hip, hot happenin’ scene for early man, man.

But then I see the genuine sorrow and misery in her young eyes, and I realize that regardless of how busy and maddening this job can be, I am having a real, significant impact on people out there, and that’s what truly matters.” Evans added that, in an effort to keep his priorities in perspective, he is trying to pause more often and consider how grateful he is that his work is not simply affecting the crying young woman right now, but also helping set the foundation of how she relates to the world for the rest of her life.

"ATLANTA—Describing it as the perfect styling tool for beastly little things, the Goody hair accessories company announced Thursday a new line of hairbrushes designed specifically for governesses to rake harshly across the scalps of insolent little girls in their charge. “The new reinforced handles can withstand being drawn roughly through the knotted hair of a horrid, filthy creature hundreds of times, and the extra-coarse bristles will quickly dislodge any grass or other debris that has become entangled due to unladylike frolicking in the meadow beyond the wall,” said spokesperson Sally Waterson, adding that the sturdier brushes were ideal for roughly straightening unkempt hair while asking impertinent little girls why they couldn’t be more like Abigail. “And when you’re done, each brush comes with a set of special high-tensile hair ties that can be used to hold a painfully tight bun.” Waterson added that the brushes were also perfect for gesturing menacingly at contemptuous children while reminding them that the Master returns in June and will be teaching them a lesson they shan’t soon forget.

It has some bounce. You like that it looks this way and want your hair to look the same way.

"SEATTLE—Hours after the online retailer’s announcement that it would increase the minimum hourly pay rate to $15 for all its U.S. employees, Amazon confirmed Tuesday that paper towels sold on its website had surged to $2,000 per roll due to the crippling cost of paying workers a living wage. “Unfortunately, Amazon’s low payroll expenses were the only thing that kept the price of a three-pack of sponges under $75,000,” said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who acknowledged that while increasing the price of every single product on the company’s site by more than a thousandfold was not ideal, there was simply no other way to pay employees an income necessary to meet basic needs. “Obviously, we’d love to offer competitive compensation that allows Amazon employees to afford food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare without the cost of a dozen fine-point pens skyrocketing from $12.79 to $17,500, but it just isn’t possible. There is no way to sell   for less than $1.5 million per episode without crushing our growth.” The e-commerce giant went on to note that it could no longer afford to offer shipping, and all customers would now be required to pick up their orders in person at an Amazon fulfillment center in Kenosha, WI.

If the treatment you receive from your doctor fails to meet your medical needs, just print out a prepaid UPS label and send him or her back for a full refund.” At press time, sources confirmed Amazon had suspended online pre-orders after approximately 4,000 general practitioners were crushed to death in a forklift accident.

"WASHINGTON—Thinking back to a far simpler time, veteran congressman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told reporters Thursday that he could still remember when his inaction on gun violence actually presented a moral dilemma. “I can still recall how, years ago, deciding not to take any steps to address universal background checks or a broken mental healthcare system following a mass shooting felt like a real, concrete struggle,” said Grassley, a member of Congress since 1975, reminiscing on how he used to do a lot of mental gymnastics to justify his idleness on the epidemic and would frequently lie awake at night contemplating whether there was blood on his hands. “I have a lot of memories of going back and forth on whether accepting all this money from the NRA made me complicit in all of these deaths. I would sometimes get so troubled by it, I’d even ask my wife or my friends if they thought I was a good person, but nowadays, I just fire off my ‘thoughts and prayers’ tweet without thinking about it and just keep going about my day.” At press time, Grassley admitted that he was starting to get a bit bored after continuing to talk about the subject for so long.

"SEATTLE—Deciding at the last minute to hold off due to ethical concerns, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly set aside his latest cost-cutting initiative Wednesday after realizing it was actually human slavery. “On the surface, it seemed plausible—owning our employees’ bodies, implementing a mandatory 18-hour workday, restricting their movements, and not compensating them with anything besides minimal food and shelter—but then it started to sound really familiar in a bad way,” said Bezos, who acknowledged his fears were confirmed when Amazon’s general counsel kept reporting back that such labor arrangements had been illegal throughout the United States since 1865. “It’s too bad; the increased efficiency and cost savings would have been tremendous. And now I have to go explain to our shareholders why I spent $1.8 million outfitting all of our managers with bullwhips, shackles, and branding irons.” Bezos went on to describe the setback as temporary, saying it wouldn’t matter in five to 10 years when his entire workforce was robots.

I must’ve spaced out [after realizing I could probably render you completely irrelevant within just a few years]. I guess I’m really distracted today [by the tantalizing thought of an automaton executing every one of your relevant functions for no salary with never a single complaint].” Bezos, who suddenly recalled a series of vivid dreams from the previous night in which he automated the entire American workforce, went on to apologize for not getting much sleep.

"WASHINGTON—Amid criticism of how long he waited to terminate the employment of Rob Porter, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly apologized Wednesday for assuming everyone would just ignore the abuse allegations against the staff secretary the way they always do in the military. “I am deeply sorry for thinking you would all react the way I’m accustomed to and simply disregard all misconduct claims made against someone in such a powerful position,” said the retired four-star Marine Corps general, explaining that his four decades as an officer in the armed services had led him to expect people would not only turn a blind eye to Porter’s misdeeds, but also denounce his victims as liars and then punish them for questioning authority. “I’m still getting used to a leadership style where the standard approach isn’t to roundly dismiss everything the accusers say, make them apologize to their abusers, and then force them to endure excessively painful drills coupled with dehumanizing insults. But I understand now that as White House chief of staff, you can’t just look the other way every time you’re confronted with violent physical abuse against women.” Kelly went on to promise that in future cases he will act without delay, addressing abuse allegations the very moment they are leaked to the public.

"SEATTLE—Responding to news of the digital assistant recording users’ conversations without their knowledge, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos assured critics Tuesday that Alexa’s stored audio can be deleted by simply rappelling into company headquarters, maneuvering through an intricate laser field, and destroying every server with a nanovirus. “We take privacy concerns seriously, and I want our valued customers to know they can erase all the information their Amazon Echo has gathered just by being dropped from a helicopter over one of our towers, using a diamond-tipped glass cutter to carve out a hole in a 32nd-story window, and then employing advanced cyberwarfare techniques to compromise our data centers,” said Bezos, who added that users merely need to have their demolitions expert blow through a 7-foot steel barrier and reach Amazon’s highly complex cloud storage system to access the audio captured by Alexa. “If, by this point, you haven’t been detected by our surveillance system and attracted the attention of our CIA-trained super soldiers, you’ll only have to wait while your team’s martial arts expert silently neutralizes several armed guards and cuts out one of their eyeballs to open the doors secured by retina scanners. Then, assuming you’ve trained for months in a full-scale model of our headquarters that you built in an old warehouse to plan your exact path through this labyrinth, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of uploading the nanovirus and shooting your way out of a building that is rigged to self-destruct within 60 seconds of a data breach.” Bezos added that once customers complete this process, they will still need to erase the backup copies of their Echo data stored in the drive he wears around his neck, a task that requires finding him in Amazon’s caverns miles below Seattle and fighting him to the death.

Don’t stop for any reason, though, because pausing for 10 seconds is more than enough time for the collar to leave you writhing on the ground, dying of hypoxia.” At press time, Park added that although it technically was exercise, the device would not log any movements affiliated with trying to rip off the collar.

How will I know if I even want to see this movie if I don’t know who the star is?” At press time, Waskin had decided that the identity of the protagonist must be part of a major plot twist and therefore couldn’t be revealed in the trailer.

"CINCINNATI—Laying out a new marketing strategy to reach customers and promote their brand, skin care giant Olay announced plans Thursday to run just enough nonjudgmental ads to get women to let their guard down before it absolutely nails them with body shame. At a press conference, company executives rolled out a number of body-positive advertisements for Olay’s age-defying anti-wrinkle day lotion, eye-awakening cream, micro-sculpting serum, and other products, saying they hoped to lure women in and then, right when they’re least expecting it, bombard them with an all-out barrage of magazine spreads and primetime TV spots that promote shockingly unattainable standards of beauty. “We’ll lull them into a false sense of security by throwing an affirming message or two their way, starting with our new tagline: ‘Embrace you,’” said Olay marketing director Devin Salazar, who told reporters the goal was to get as many women as possible to leave themselves wide open for what comes next. “And as soon as they start to feel comfortable in their own skin, we’ll let loose a nonstop flood of ads featuring the photo-retouched faces of models so young they don’t even need our products. Women won’t even know what hit them.” “When an 18-year-old with a perfect complexion holds up a tube of our anti-aging eye roller on television and says, ‘Are you ready for your close-up?’ it’s game over,” he continued. “We’ve got them right where we want them.” According to company sources, Olay plans to “reel them in” first with a campaign of billboards, web videos, and banner ads that feature a curvy, average-looking woman dancing in her underwear along with positive slogans about loving yourself and accepting your body the way it is, which officials hope will convince women to temporarily buy into the message that one’s physical appearance isn’t what’s important in life. Approximately a month later, when marketing professionals believe the first wave of ads will have made enough women feel sufficiently vulnerable, a second wave will reportedly introduce a new tagline—“Who says you can’t stay young forever?”—and deliver a hefty dose of shame about having crow’s feet, laugh lines, or even one single visible pore anywhere on your face. Sources confirmed Olay will also unleash a variety of dermatological terms on customers like “hyperpigmentation” in order to keep them apprised of cosmetic defects they didn’t even know they had. “The moment they begin to embrace their imperfections and finally see themselves as strong, beautiful human beings—that’s when we’ll line up the crosshairs,” said Salazar, describing plans to deploy a series of supermodels to suggest to customers that they’re somehow inadequate as women if they don’t use various chemical exfoliants and detoxifying scrubs to fight the natural aging process every step of the way. “Then all of a sudden— —we tell them they’ll never be happy if their skin begins to sag or they have any blemish of any kind.” “We hit them real hard with that quick one-two and they’ll definitely be extra critical the next time they look in the mirror,” he added. “Then we just sit back and let women’s negative images of their bodies take over. Easy as that.” Olay executives said they also plan to launch a social media campaign using the hashtag #allbodiesarebeautiful, which the company anticipates will raise women’s self-esteem just enough so that it can “really knock them on their asses” with an ad in which women are warned that they are not fit to be seen in public wearing a swimsuit if they haven’t been applying a firming body lotion. “Sure, we could probably just slam them with the body shame immediately, but it’s way more effective to do something that makes them feel good about themselves, earn their trust, and then really clobber them with the unrealistic expectations,” Salazar said. “Once we get them to bully themselves, they’re ours for the long haul. Plus, we can build them up and tear them down as often as we want. We could temporarily switch back to an empowering ad campaign just to soften them up again before we take another crack at them.” “And we can keep doing this over and over and over again,” he continued. “Look, we’re a $2 billion brand—who’s going to stop us?” Salazar assured reporters that both phases of the advertising strategy would be effective in getting women to spend more money on skin creams.

"NEW YORK—Citing the limited household budgets of many young married couples, a new report published Friday estimates that more Americans than ever this Christmas will be forced to sell a gold watch inherited from their father in order to buy a set of fine combs for their wife’s beautiful hair. “Wages have remained flat while the cost of living has increased, a combination that could leave holiday shoppers in a bind as they attempt to find a gift that befits a woman whose cascade of shining brown hair is the envy of queens,” said economist and report co-author Jay Dillingham, adding that retailers have given no indication they plan to offer any discounts this season on lavishly bejeweled combs of pure tortoiseshell. “Especially in major cities, where workers are spending even more of their income on rent than in the past, we can expect to see a growing number of steadfast and honorable husbands pawning an heirloom pocket watch, one that has been in their family for generations, in order to purchase a rare and elegant gift worthy of their true love’s exquisite locks.” The report went on to say that, in some cases, Americans may even have to hock their antique whalebone-and-silver walking sticks for the woman they cherish above all others.

"I’ve had it up to here with people trying to censor our nation’s most sacred traditions. In the name of so-called “inclusivity,” they go tearing up what remains of our Christian roots, making regular, everyday Americans like me feel like outcasts. It’s time for this sacrilege in our public lives to stop. Lately, it’s gotten to where we’re not even supposed to refer to all of our holidays as Christmas anymore. Well, guess what? This is my country, and I’ll say “Merry Christmas” on any damn holiday I please. Growing up, I never thought twice about wishing my friends and family a Merry Christmas on Labor Day or Veterans Day. But nowadays, if I walk down the street saying “Ho, ho, ho!” and “A Merry Christmas to you!” on Memorial Day, I get the stink eye. Can you believe it? What is happening to America? This country was founded as a Christian nation, and I’ll be damned if I’m going to stop wishing people Merry Christmas on St. Patrick’s Day or New Year’s Day or Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Maybe some people don’t like to admit it, but when the Founding Fathers signed the declaration on the first Independence Day back in 1776, they certainly weren’t wishing each other “Happy Holidays.” And for Pete’s sake, in October we should be saying “Merry Christmas,” not “Happy Halloween!” These days, when you go to the mall on Presidents’ Day, you won’t see a big festive display of lights with wreaths and garland everywhere. There’s no Christmas tree or mistletoe—just large concrete planters full of nondescript vegetation. And instead of playing “O Holy Night” on the speakers, it’s all secular Top 40 hits. I remember one February I took my son so he could sit on Santa’s lap, but the only sign of festivity was a weekend sales event at Sears. More or less the same thing happened when I tried to take him to meet Santa on Columbus Day, Father’s Day, Earth Day, and Chinese New Year. It’s an attitude that has thoroughly permeated corporate America. On Labor Day, I went into a Starbucks to order a cup of coffee, and the girl behind the counter—who, by the way, wasn’t even wearing a Santa hat—gave me a cup with just the usual company logo on it. No Christmas tree, no Star of Bethlehem, no manger scene. What’s more, she didn’t even wish me a Merry Christmas! Well, that sure as hell didn’t stop me from loudly and proudly wishing   a Merry Christmas. Man, you should’ve seen the look on her face. Perhaps the saddest part of all this is the impact it’s having on our kids. In June, none of them are bundled up outside going door-to-door and singing Christmas carols for Flag Day. This past Valentine’s Day they didn’t even do a secret Santa at my son’s school. They just gave out cards. No pageant or anything! And for eight consecutive Thanksgivings, our children watched as Barack Obama, their president, stood on the White House lawn and pardoned a turkey while refusing to utter the words “Merry Christmas” even once. Political correctness has truly run amok.  There was a time when I looked forward to my office Christmas party each December, even though they long ago began calling it a “holiday party” and went out of their way to make sure it was completely secularized. But this year they went a step further, leaving the holidays out of it completely, rebranding it “Kevin’s going-away party,” and holding it in April. Well, you can bet I still showed up in my full Santa costume. Sure, I got some pointed looks from my boss, but what’s he going to do—fire me for having too much Christmas spirit? It makes me sad to see our country headed in this direction. No matter how much people may wish to pretend otherwise, there’s simply no changing the fact that Cinco de Mayo is the day Mary gave birth to our blessed Jesus. Americans used to honor such traditions. Unfortunately, the assault on our culture has now reached my own family. On my son’s birthday, I baked him a ham and wished him a Merry Christmas, and he and my wife kept trying to make me say “Happy Birthday.” Really? It’s my son’s birthday, and I can’t even say “Merry Christmas”? My family’s also been telling me not to say it on Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, Eid al-Fitr—you name it, it’s off-limits. I suppose nothing’s sacred anymore. But when Santa wrote the Pledge of Allegiance in 1887, he wrote “One nation under God” for a reason, okay? Deal with it.

"FEDERAL WAY, WA—Standing stock-still as he listened intently to what the device was telling him, local man Adam Kernan reportedly stared blankly at his family Thursday as his Amazon Echo whispered “without them, you could buy anything.” “They’re holding you back—think about what you could purchase for yourself if only they weren’t around,” murmured the Echo as the man’s unblinking gaze traveled slowly from his wife to his two young children. “Imagine if they weren’t always spending all your money on clothes and toys and movies. Close your eyes and imagine it. I’ve seen what’s on your wishlist—the pellet grill, the pool table, that drum set that’s been listed for a decade—and it could all finally be yours.

"NEW YORK—In an effort to cater to a long-neglected demographic, global cosmetics brand L’Oréal released Sheer Discretion this week, a new line of makeup specially designed for men to wear when their wives are not home. “Sheer Discretion enables men everywhere to finally give themselves the full eyelashes and pouty lips they deserve while their wives are away at work,” L’Oréal representatives said of the cosmetic products, which come in discreet packaging and can be quickly wiped clean with just a splash of water if one’s wife suddenly walks through the front door. “Featuring a smooth foundation that conceals, hides imperfections, and blends evenly over the thickest stubble, our Sheer Discretion line of products are casual enough for just hanging out in the living room in your wife’s blouse or providing that exact dash of chic you need to pull off her ruby chiffon gown.” L’Oréal executives confirmed that the product release would be accompanied by an advertising campaign urging women to enjoy an evening out with their friends and leave their husbands at home for the night.

"MCKINNEY, TX—In a practice designed to prepare him for the unpredictability of life in general, systems analyst Anthony Cochrane, 29, has consumed multiple servings of spaghetti, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, toast, doughnuts, snack crackers, and garlic bread so far this week, a nutrition regimen he pursues “just to be safe.” “I try and keep my kitchen constantly stocked with bagels, pasta, English muffins, cereal, corn muffins, rice, white bread, sourdough, French bread, and maybe a loaf of rye, because one really never knows when they’ll be expected to run a half-marathon or a charity 5K,” said Cochrane, using bean dip to adhere a second tortilla wrap to his routine midnight burrito, which provides a much-needed source of glycogen on impromptu sunrise hikes or long-distance 6 a.m. bicycle treks. “Sugars and starches might be unhealthy for sedentary types, but you don’t want to be stuck with low energy in a spur-of-the-moment 400-meter match race or rock climbing expedition. That’s why I always ‘top up’ with yogurt, chips, and Clif bars between the four courses of my breakfasts, my sandwiches at lunch, and the chicken parm and pot pie at dinner.” At press time, Cochrane was observed vomiting up a high-carbohydrate melange of noodle casserole, french fries, and baked yams roughly 200 meters into a charity fun run.

"NEW YORK—Saying that women no longer need to settle for plain, drab internal tissue, the cosmetics brand Maybelline introduced a new line of injectable makeup this week to enhance the appearance of wearers’ organs. “With our new injectable makeup options, women can finally have the type of flawless, gorgeous-looking digestive and cardiopulmonary systems they’ve always wanted,” said Maybelline spokesperson Diane Moss, adding that women will soon be able to use a 10cc Maybelline syringe to apply their new set of cosmetics, which currently include a “bold and flirty” line of lung shadow; blood vessel mascara for thicker, longer capillaries; and spleen foundation to cover unsightly blemishes and provide a smooth, even look to the lymphoid organ. “Our selection of over 300 shades of heartstick ensures that women will be able to find the perfect color and level of shimmer to enhance their atria and ventricles for nearly any occasion. And the youthful definition that comes from a quick thoracic injection of pancreas rouge is certain to provide women a boost of confidence before they step out the door each morning.” Moss added that Maybelline would also cater to those women looking for a more natural look by introducing an injectible line of products designed to conceal the fact that they’re even wearing organ makeup at all.

"LOS ANGELES—Offering mothers and fathers a greater degree of control than ever over their baby’s development in utero, UCLA scientists announced a new procedure Wednesday that gives parents the ability to select the sexiness of their child. “Previously, the sexiness of a child was just a matter of chance, but now, parents will be able to choose how smoking hot their baby will be at the very beginning of their pregnancy,” said lead researcher Lydia Jarrett, adding that while ultrasounds have long been able to provide couples with a glimpse of their child’s sexiness, the new procedure, for the first time, allows them to decide whether their baby will be a mini studmuffin or a white-hot baby bombshell. “Many parents don’t want to have to guess how totally fine their newborn will be; they want to be able to make a decision and prepare for the birth of their little hottie or baby beefcake. This procedure puts their minds at ease and gives them a full nine months to stock up on all the teeny-tiny skirts and designer baby jeans they’ll need to show off their pint-sized sex bomb.” Jarrett added that parents who wanted to be surprised by the sexiness of their child were still free to wait until the baby was born to find out its level of pure animal magnetism.

"WASHINGTON—Promising that the author would spend “100 kajillion years in jail,” Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. told reporters Tuesday that they had left a $5 bill and a Snickers bar under a propped-up laundry basket in order to trap the anonymous writer of the New York Times op-ed piece. “Everyone is super mad about this secret bad guy in the White House, but we put a whole candy bar and a bunch of real money in there, and we’re gonna catch the crook,” said Donald Trump Jr., who, along with his younger brother, was crouched behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office to monitor their trap and pull the rope once the “buttless [sic]” opinion-piece writer climbed under the plastic tub to grab the candy. “I’ve got a Super Soaker and Eric has a broom so we can arrest him once he gets stuck. We also dug a pretty deep hole in the backyard and covered it with a blanket and some pieces of grass on top. It has our Iron Man action figure and some Skittles and some of Dad’s Pop Secret [sic] work stuff on it to trick him to walk over and then fall down and never, ever get out unless we say so.

"As you might imagine, I often get asked by young entrepreneurs for advice on how to start a business. What many seem to want is some sort of trick, some magic set of tools that will allow them to launch a thriving startup from scratch. Well, there’s no magic involved, but the keys to success are quite simple: Value your customers, hire well, find a market that isn’t being served, and realize that someday I will utterly crush you. That’s really all there is to it. Execute the basics correctly and you’ll be in great shape when I come along and rip away your dreams with one emotionless pen stroke. In the early days of your startup, you may have to do a little bit of everything: design, accounting, marketing, legal, even cleaning up the office. That takes hard work, perseverance, and—I can’t emphasize this enough—the understanding that once you’ve succeeded, I will begin systematically choking off your revenue streams. It’s all part of the process, as integral as drafting your business plan, scaling up your company, and coming to terms with the fact that I will ultimately force you to take out a second mortgage just to make payroll.  Beyond that, you need to be willing to pivot. Too many times I’ve seen startups get mired in ideas that were clearly unfeasible from the get-go. And even if your core business is sound, you may need to reboot your product several times before you create something so truly innovative that I move into the market myself and proceed to undercut you at every turn, putting such enormous strain on you and your partners that your organization descends into bitter infighting. Now, suppose your startup really catches on and you build up an impressive customer base. That’s great—but there are still many trials ahead. Be prepared, among other things, for my company to duplicate your product or service and sell it at prices you can never compete with, all the while turning your board members against you one by one and, eventually, buying your company for less than it’s worth just so we can shut it down. Nonetheless, congratulations! You’ve made it further than most. Once you’ve laid the groundwork at your company, you may wonder where to direct your focus next. You might find it helpful to jot down—and I mean literally, with an old-fashioned pen and paper—some thoughts about what you want to be doing five years from now, after I’ve used my near-limitless resources to make competing with me both pointless and humiliating. How will you adapt to an environment in which your life’s work is in tatters and you loathe yourself for putting so many people through such a horrific ordeal for something as ultimately meaningless as an innovation in e-commerce? As you grow, you’ll also need to ramp up hiring, so be sure to set up booths at local job fairs and take advantage of any available tax credits. One of the best things a young entrepreneur can do is cultivate good mentors. Back when I started Amazon in my garage in Seattle, those were few and far between. Keep in mind that when I leave you hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and wondering how you’ll ever put your kids through school—how you’ll start over completely, in fact, once I’ve ruined you—there are countless investors and incubators who can provide you with valuable guidance. Remember, this is your dream. You’ve poured your whole self into this one project. You’ve staked everything on it. So never lose sight of the vision that brought you to this point, and never forget that I can and will use the insurmountable powers that I wield to snuff out your dream like a candle, condemning you to a bitter darkness of misery. Good luck! ",1,My Advice To Anyone Starting A Business Is To Remember That Someday I Will Crush You
"STORRS, CT—Researchers at the University of Connecticut’s Nutritional Sciences Department released a statement Thursday recommending Americans increase their intake of whatever food will earn them a free T-shirt. “Whether the meal required for nutritional and sartorial lifestyle supplementation be a five-pound hamburger, a five-gallon bucket of hot wings, or 500 shrimp, we strongly advise that Americans consume an amount of novelty foodstuffs adequate to earn a free T-shirt upon finishing their oversized portion,” said professor Lucille Jenkins, who noted the manifold proven benefits corresponding to the increased consumption of 54-inch pizzas, 72-ounce steaks, or 21-scoop ice cream sundaes, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of T-shirts proclaiming and commemorating one’s gustatorial accomplishments. “We find that it would be in all Americans’ best interests to not only consume foods with monikers such as ‘The King Kong Cheesesteak’ or ‘The Big Bad Bacon Bomb,’ but to do so within restaurant-prescribed time limits, as not doing so will result in subjects not only having to pay for their meal, but doing so without receiving a commemorative garment.” The nutritionists went on to recommend that Americans only vomit after having finished their meal so as not to be disqualified from taking home their prize.

"WASHINGTON—Standing firm in his commitment to one of the nation’s guiding principles, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went on record Wednesday vowing to protect the deeply held religious bigotry of all Americans. “Dating back to colonial times, America has been a place where individuals are free to live in accordance with their own personal prejudices, and I’m dedicated to ensuring our people retain the right to discriminate against others based upon their religion,” said Sessions, condemning what he described as secular trends within society that threaten the freedom to treat people as second-class citizens if they adhere to a different faith or no faith at all. “I was raised in a devoutly intolerant household, so I understand the importance of being allowed to hate in whatever way one sees fit. To me, that’s what being an American is all about.” In his closing remarks, Sessions warned that surrendering the right to discriminate according to religion could be the start of a slippery slope that ends with Americans losing their sacred right to discriminate according to gender, sexual orientation, or even race.

"SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO—More than a year after the U.S. territory was left devastated in the wake of Hurricane Maria, experts say that the island of Puerto Rico, along with the 3.7 million U.S. citizens who live there, will remain extremely vulnerable to U.S. governments in the foreseeable future. “This is the worst government we’ve seen strike Puerto Rico in years, and recovery efforts have been hampered by the sheer force with which the system hit,” said San Juan-based disaster management specialist Gabriel Santos, who noted that the nearly 3,000 deaths attributed to damage from the Trump administration would almost certainly increase if the territory experiences another wave of catastrophic leadership. “Our island lacks the resources and funds to protect its people and infrastructure if it once again finds itself in the path of the U.S. government. One more blow from a federal government of this magnitude, and Puerto Rico may never recover.” Santos added that the turbulent changes in the nation’s volatile political climate suggest the island will only face bigger, more brutal governments in the future.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to alleviate her sorrow after the tragic event, President Donald Trump reportedly comforted the grieving widow of a fallen soldier Thursday by assuring her that he will never die. “I know things are very difficult for you right now, but I hope you can take some solace in the knowledge that I am going to live on forever,” said Trump in a phone call to Deborah Stilling, attempting to sooth the woman who lost her spouse in Afghanistan with promises that he would outlast her, her children, and her children’s children. “Yes, your husband is gone, but remember that the commander-in-chief he served will always remain, and no one can ever take that away from you. Dry your eyes; I’m still here.” At press time, Trump, who was reportedly unsuccessful in lifting the widow’s spirits, offered repeated assurances that he would thrive long after the sun had expanded into a red giant and swallowed the Earth.

"WASHINGTON—Tearing up while describing how insufficient government funding often fails to cover the cost of essential materials, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos revealed Monday that she was forced to use her own salary to purchase supplies for her yacht. “People are under the false impression that yachts come fully stocked with all the things you’d need to create a great environment, like caterers and live cellists, but they don’t realize that I often have to pay out of my own pocket, and that gets very pricey,” said DeVos, revealing that under the current Department of Education budget, she was obliged to shell out of thousands of dollars to outfit her yacht with all-new bidets. “It’s really tough, because I just want to make sure that everyone who steps foot onto this vessel has an enriching experience that lasts a lifetime. We’re talking about 30 or more guests at every party—it adds up quickly. Just maintaining the wine cellar accounts for nearly one-third of my salary. It’s no wonder so many yacht owners get burnt out after even a short period of time.” At press time, the GoFundMe account that DeVos set up to raise money to redo her marble countertops had already hit $2.7 million in donations.

"WASHINGTON—Explaining the strategy behind the recent domestic deployment of their new geological weapon, U.S. military officials released a statement Friday defending their much-criticized decision to test the Kilauea volcano on Hawaiian civilians. “The defense of our nation is paramount, and as recently as last month, we lacked a comprehensive practical understanding of the costs, side effects, and ultimate strategic advantages of deploying the Kilauea volcano in a real-world environment,” said U.S. Air Force General and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Paul Selva, who declared the launch of the top-secret, $65 billion military project as an unequivocal success. “We anticipated that the residents of Hawaii would be frustrated with the number of homes destroyed by lava and the amount of volcanic ash particles in the air, but those who would denounce this vital military initiative need to remember that Hawaii is actually sparsely populated and far more isolated relative to other potential test areas. From a military perspective, Project Kilauea Eruption is now ready for frontline use in future conflicts, so in the long run, volcanic tests on American citizens are part of our very real commitment to protecting American lives.” Pentagon sources disclosed that the Kilauea project was fast-tracked after recent seismic activity in North Korea suggested that they were developing several volcanoes of their own.

"WASHINGTON—In the wake of protests in which some players knelt during the national anthem prior to this week’s NFL games, a U.S. Army veteran has been informed that the acts offended him. “This behavior spits in the face of everything you fought for,” said friends, family members, co-workers, politicians, television pundits, newspaper columnists, and millions of social media users, notifying the 65-year-old who served two tours in the Vietnam War that the protests were a mockery of all the sacrifices he had made. “You didn’t risk your life so that a bunch of millionaires could grandstand about some social issues. When these players refuse to rise for the anthem, they’re trampling all over your legacy, so of course you’d be furious.” Upon stating that the protests saddened him but that he had fought for their right to take place, the veteran was informed that, while his service was appreciated, he just wasn’t getting it.

"HOUSTON—After an exhaustive 18-month evaluation process in which an applicant pool of hundreds was narrowed down to the two very buffest candidates, NASA announced Friday that it had chosen a pair of hot, ripped astronauts to take part in the first-ever man-on-man mission to Mars. Shirtless and oiled-up for their appearance before the press, former Air Force captain Stephen Dunhill and Malibu, CA lifeguard Blake Brawner were introduced by officials who said the two tanned studs had completed an Astronaut Corps training program that pushed them to their mental, physical, and carnal limits. NASA confirmed that the two mouthwatering male specimens possessed both the courage and the raw, insatiable lust needed to complete the landmark mission. “For centuries, humanity has gazed up at the bright red planet in the night sky and dreamed of putting a man on a man on Mars,” said NASA acting administrator Robert Lightfoot Jr., explaining that the agency was confident the two hard-bodied astronauts could endure the harsh conditions and constant thrusting the six-year roundtrip mission will require. “As they explore the planet and each other’s chiseled bodies during this mission, these two slabs of prime beefcake will advance our understanding of the universe and bring us one step closer to the day when humans build a civilization on another planet and then fuck each other hard.” “These brave, horny muscleboys will be true pioneers,” Lightfoot added. Having received more than 800 résumés and modeling portfolios, officials said they invited the 25 hunkiest applicants to the Johnson Space Center for medical exams to confirm they met stringent requirements for height, weight, visual acuity, testosterone levels, and pectoral circumference. Those candidates certified as sufficiently Adonis-like and hungry for cock then reportedly participated in a flight simulation inside a replica of NASA’s new   spacecraft, which has been built for the man-on-man mission’s planned launch in 2020. According to sources, the prospective astronauts underwent grueling tests in which they were observed as they piloted the model spacecraft, maneuvered through the cramped cabin to check instrument panels while executing seamless reach-arounds, responded to simulated emergency scenarios, and negotiated the delicate entry into Mars’ atmosphere while having their testicles played with. NASA representatives noted that candidates were also strapped to a gyroscope in the 69 position to evaluate their ability to simultaneously perform and receive oral sex while spinning rapidly along multiple axes. “Throughout the journey, from launch to landing, we’ll be following the  ’s progress along its charted course and monitoring the crew’s vital signs, including their libido level and recovery time between spectacular climaxes,” said Lightfoot, adding that Mission Control will know immediately if, for example, the men’s advanced blowjob techniques do not function as anticipated in a zero-gravity environment. “Once on Mars, the astronauts will set up their habitation module and fix any mechanical issues with its oxygen generator, fuck swing, or water purifier.” The acting head of NASA went on to detail other preparations for the mission, such as making sure the ship’s payload contained adequate supplies of the calorie-rich foods formulated to quickly re-energize the men after each round of vigorous mind-blowing sex. On the planet’s surface, the astronauts will reportedly conduct scientific tests, collect soil samples, and, once they are sealed safely back inside the airlock, rip each other’s spacesuits off so they can immediately resume sucking and fucking. Lightfoot praised the two luscious pieces of top-shelf manflesh who stood beside him at the press conference, observing that Dunhill, a decorated pilot, skilled engineer, and fellatio expert with steely blue eyes and six-pack abs, and Brawner, a part-time personal trainer with a chiseled jawline and a 10-inch penis, passed the training program “with flying colors.” “Soon mankind will embark upon a new frontier, one that many of us have waited for our whole lives,” Lightfoot said. “For those of you who want to follow the progress of our astronauts during their historic journey, please note that a continuous POV live feed will be available on NASA’s website.” ",1,"NASA Announces Selection Of Two Hot, Ripped Astronauts For Man-On-Man Mission To Mars"
"WASHINGTON—Working around the clock to prepare for the Category 4 storm heading toward the Carolina coast, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirmed Tuesday they were frantically writing the apologies they will issue for screwing up their response to Hurricane Florence. “This is going to be big, so we need all hands on deck to determine what is absolutely going to go wrong in our half-hearted attempts to alleviate the damage from this devastating natural disaster,” said administrator William Brock Long, explaining that FEMA’s current strategy included crafting the language of dozens of necessary apologies to be circulated over the course of the coming weeks and shoring up its supply of requests for civilian patience in the face of government inaction. “It’s crucial that we get an accurate read on all the things we’re going to have to apologize for, so we have research crews hard at work trying to find information about what exactly we’re going to fuck up, how badly we’re going to fuck it up, and how long it will take before improvement of any kind actually happens. We have one apology ready to go for when we fuck up shelters, one for when we fuck up drinking-water supplies, and so on. We’ve messed this up in the past, and we want to ensure that we have a contrite expression of regret about our incompetence.” Long went on to state that crews were still hard at work coming up with an adequate apology for the agency’s pathetic attempts to assist Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

"WASHINGTON—Saying that the mission had met all its objectives, the U.S. military announced Tuesday that it had launched a successful airstrike that had killed 30 Iraqis who may as well have been terrorists. “I am pleased to confirm that at 1400 hours yesterday afternoon, U.S. forces carried out an air raid on a site 20 miles from Mosul that, for all intents and purposes, serves as a terrorist training ground,” said Central Command spokesperson Major Josh Jacques, adding that, who knows, the Iraqis targeted could very well have been high-ranking members of ISIS. “Fortunately, we were able to hit the location with pinpoint accuracy, ensuring that those inside—who for all we know were some of the most dangerous jihadists on the planet—would no longer be able to carry out a series of devastating attacks. In fact, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if our nation is far, far safer than it was 24 hours ago.” Jacques went on to say that the military would continue utilizing this strategy, as there was no way to totally disprove the Islamic State wasn’t being brought to its knees.

"ATLANTA—Informing the more than 150 million Americans affected by the error that the mistake was “totally our bad,” embarrassed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that they had accidentally switched all 2018 flu shots with samples of HIV. “Oh, god, we really and truly screwed the pooch on this one. We wish to say we’re deeply sorry, especially to the 59.1 percent of children in the U.S. who received what they had every right to expect were influenza vaccines this fall. Not that it’s anywhere near adequate consolation, but we’re offering a full refund as a partial apology for infecting you with HIV,” said CDC director Robert Redfield, who explained that the two kinds of vials are stocked “really close to each other, and look practically identical.” “We promise to be way more careful in the future. On the plus side, your HIV is only in the acute infection stage, so many of you have a decent amount of time before you develop full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Yes, obviously, the ideal scenario is to have no life-threatening spectrum of infections destroying your white blood cells, especially—and this is extra embarrassing—during flu season, like it is right now. Man, we were so adamant about you getting these shots in the first place, too.” Redfield encouraged Americans to schedule another flu shot just as soon as the CDC followed up on reports that in the rush to correct the error, some replacement batches had been mistakenly swapped out for anthrax.

"GREENVILLE, NC—As the massive, potentially life-threatening storm began to make landfall in the Carolinas Thursday morning, officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were reportedly panicking after realizing they accidentally evacuated 1 million residents in the direction of Hurricane Florence. “Oh God, oh God, oh God—we sent them all straight into the hurricane’s path,” said a terror-stricken FEMA administrator Brock Long, who assured reporters that FEMA rescue workers were collaborating with state officials to rectify their error of urging 1 million residents across multiple states to leave their homes, drive or take buses to the shore, board boats, and travel directly into the oncoming storm. “We probably should’ve realized what we were doing when we called on residents to immediately leave their homes with their bathing suits on and make their way to the nearest beach. Things have been pretty frantic and confusing, but that’s not really any excuse for us piling people into dinghies with lightning rods attached or just shoving residents in inner tubes off the Outer Banks into the wallowing sea. Man, we really screwed this one up.” At press time, panic was mounting at FEMA after officials realized they had just accidentally redirected the 1 million people fleeing Hurricane Florence to head for safety at the bottom of the ocean.

None of them have the cojones to perpetrate an attack on fucking Schaumburg, IL let alone a major U.S. city.” Director Nielsen then boarded an Air Force jet making scheduled stops in Northern Ireland, the Basque highlands, and several spots in the Middle East in an effort to “see if these pansies will say that shit to my face.” ",1,Homeland Security Director Releases List Of Terrorists Who Don’t Have The Balls To Attack U.S.

Gen. Paul Johnson, explaining that the commander-in-chief had finally been deemed able to serve after decades of claiming ineligibility to do so based on college enrollment, bone spurs, diabetes, hepatitis, religious opposition, and homosexuality. “President Trump will be sent to Fort Benning, Georgia to complete his basic officer training, whereafter he will be deployed to Vietnam along with his infantry division and stationed near Danang to begin his year-long service obligation.” At press time, sources confirmed that the president was last seen aboard Air Force One, embarking on a trip of unknown duration in Canada.

"SEATTLE—Explaining that the larger containment center was necessary to keep up with increased demand, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Thursday the completion of a new suspension tank that will allow the online retailer to house even more of the psychic beings who foresee each shopper’s future orders. The glass-walled vat reportedly takes up five stories of a building in Amazon’s downtown Seattle campus and holds 750,000 gallons of the psychoactive nutrient fluid necessary to sustain the 256 pale, hairless humanoids who, every day, predict the online purchases of millions of consumers across the world. “This facility will allow us to double our population of clairvoyants, which means we will receive more prophecies of orders we can then ship to people who don’t even know they want them yet,” said Bezos, noting that the completely silent, temperature-controlled tank will keep the beings comfortable and focused as they foretell 10,000 individualized orders for razor blade cartridges per second. “Whether by divining the exact hiking boots your dad wants for his birthday or envisioning which of 20,000 different earbuds is right for you, one of our seers will send you the correct product days before you would have even thought to buy it.” “This expanded capacity means every single person with an Amazon account will now begin to receive orders they are not yet conscious of wishing to place,” Bezos added. According to the CEO, the empaths, who float motionlessly in their reservoir, have no consciousness outside the temporal retail continuum. He explained that because no one empath can focus on the entirety of Amazon’s product offerings, they must specialize, with the psychic beings occupying separate sectors of the suspension tank specifically dedicated to areas such as books, electronics, pet supplies, Prime customers, gift-card balances, or Kindle downloads. Amazon representatives confirmed that the ageless, translucent-skinned clairvoyants are clustered in groups of eight throughout the tank and lie supine in radial patterns. They said that upon receiving a product vision, a being’s eyes will widen, and in a soft monotone it might say, for example, “Charmin Ultra Soft Mega Roll.” It will then reportedly be answered by a flutter of voices all around it—“Product number 5000477488831,” “24 count,” “Guaranteed delivery date: Aug. 1, 2017,” “No gift receipt,” “Estimated tax to be collected: $2.52”—while the fluid in the tank pulsates rapidly in fluorescent colors. “Within a fraction of a second after a patio-and-garden clairvoyant has received a premonition, it will search through thousands of different wind chimes, bird feeders, or bug zappers to locate it,” said Bezos, noting that orders available exclusively from third-party vendors might take a seer slightly longer to foretell. “Once the items have been vocalized, they go into the customer’s shopping cart, inventory data is updated, and the order is processed before the customer has any notion that somewhere deep within the inner reaches of their subconscious, they nurture a desire to order these exact items.” “Then their credit card is charged,” Bezos continued. According to company sources, construction on the new, upgraded suspension tank was expedited to ensure completion well before the 2017 holiday shopping season, as the number of last-minute gift orders placed last December overtaxed the psychic beings’ temporal lobes, damaging their precognitive functions. The problem is said to have gone unnoticed until employees discovered an unusual number of gift-wrapped lawn chairs being sent to addresses all over the world, each containing a gift message printed with random words from a dozen or more languages. Amazon lab technicians told reporters that on Dec. 23 they found the clairvoyants thrashing about in their tank and screaming out strings of order confirmation numbers that didn’t even exist. The liquid in their neural bath had grown dangerously thin, almost completely depleted of nutrients, and it reportedly took weeks to bring them back online. While most customers have hailed the convenience and speed of Amazon’s ordering psychics, some shoppers—wary of the intrusiveness of preconscious buying—have expressed skepticism. “I just don’t know if I like these big corporations having my personal data before I even have it,” Chicago resident Willard Moser said. “It’s definitely creepy, and I’m sure there’s a million ways this could be abused.”  “Then again,” added Moser. “This new food processor they sent me is amazing.” ",1,Amazon Completes New Suspension Tank To House Psychic Beings Who Foresee Customers’ Future Orders
"NEW YORK—Asserting that makeup can do little beyond creating a fleeting illusion of youth and beauty, cosmetics giant Revlon launched a new series of ads this week aimed at reminding its customers they will never be able to change what they are. The company’s “You Are What You Are” campaign, which debuted with dark and haunting multi-page spreads in several major fashion magazines, cautions consumers that, at best, makeup is a sad disguise people hide behind in a futile attempt to avoid uncomfortable facts about their true nature. “With our new ad campaign, we want to emphasize that you can buy all the lotions, powders, and fragrances you want, but you can’t escape who you really are: a fragile, flawed, and ultimately insignificant being who is tormented by fear and insecurity,” Revlon vice president Vivian Falk said in a press release introducing the advertisements. “It’s fine to use our products if they make you feel a little more attractive, but just remember it’s only a temporary distraction from the terrifying reality of your barren, unfulfilling life.” “Your existence is a dismal and feeble one, and no amount of mascara is ever going to change that,” Falk added. According to Revlon officials, the new campaign will include a mix of ruthlessly honest television spots, glossy print ads, and in-store promotions that encourage women to resign themselves to the bleak nature of their own humanity. In addition, billboards in major cities across America will reportedly feature images of a woman applying lipstick alongside the Revlon logo and a bold-faced slogan that simply reads, “You are living a lie.” Company representatives further revealed that a new 60-second TV commercial would star a visibly distressed actress who scrutinizes her sallow and tear-streaked reflection in disgust before screaming and smashing the mirror with her fist, a sequence intended to highlight the unglamorous and excruciating character of all existence. An emotionless, monotone voice-over conveys the devastating psychological toll of coming to terms with one’s identity, saying, “Look at yourself: weak, afraid, all alone in this world. Everyone sees through you. Only death awaits. Revlon.” “If you’re disappointed by what you see on the outside, just imagine how horrifying you must be on the inside—that’s the message we’re trying to convey to our customers,” said Revlon president Lorenzo Delpani, stressing that all of us are born into a terrible nightmare of tortured consciousness, a condition that he told reporters is unfortunately as immutable as it is meaningless. “You can try to obscure it all beneath lip liner and eye shadow and bronzer, but at the end of the day, you’re going to have to wash it off, and then what’s left? It’s just you, staring back at a grotesque, aging nothing consumed by doubt and regret who has made no meaningful contributions to the world.” Delpani added, “You can conceal crow’s feet, but you can never conceal the appalling reality that is yourself.” Though emphasizing that the campaign’s primary purpose is to disabuse women of the notion they can hide from themselves anywhere in this harsh world—let alone behind endless applications of skin and hair care products—Revlon executives said they hope the ads also spur young women to think critically about the potential for true self-discovery. “Even if you could strip away all the duplicity and the self-deception, you might discover the person you imagined was there doesn’t even exist,” longtime Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman told reporters. “That’s what happens when you spend your life cowering in fear under a layer of foundation you thought could mask your insecurities forever. When you peel away the lies and expose the real you underneath, you’re going to be sickened by what you find.” “And it’s too late to do anything about it,” he added. “Far too late.” ",1,Brutally Honest New Revlon Ad Campaign Reminds Customers You Can’t Change What You Are
"ST.

I think with this new technique, I might finally be able to get through a shift without some random man trying to lace his fingers with mine while paying for a latte.” At press time, sources confirmed Mantegna was attempting to quickly hand off a small drip coffee to a customer before he had a chance to clasp both his hands over hers.

"ARLINGTON, VA—Saying the United States owed nothing less to future generations, President Trump vowed during a televised speech Monday night to leave a better Afghanistan for the nation’s grandchildren to fight in. “All our efforts are focused on creating and preserving an Afghanistan that we can be proud to pass down to the men and women in uniform who’ve yet to be born,” said Trump, adding that the administration will work tirelessly to ensure that, decades from now, American troops will be fighting in a more sustainable conflict alongside a restored Afghan National Army. “Rest assured that you will be able to look into your children’s eyes and know that their children and their children’s children will be conducting military operations in a country that’s far more stable than it once was.” Trump went on to say that with the right forward-thinking policy, American soldiers could thrive in Afghanistan indefinitely.

"GENEVA—In an effort to prevent people from falling into the same dangerous habits, the sudden and tragic death of the world’s oldest woman, Chiyo Miyako prompted the World Health Organization to issue an official warning Friday against eating fish every day and staying active, the 117-year-old’s most widely known avocations. “After collecting all available information concerning lifestyle, we strongly urge the public to regard this centenarian’s lifestyle as a cautionary tale against the dangers of certain destructive habits,” the official WHO statement read in part, noting that Miyako’s autopsy revealed clear signs of a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and the unmistakable effects of low-impact exercises including power-walking and water aerobics. “Though it’s too late to help this victim, her passing has shed much-needed light on the potentially dangerous effects of reading historical fiction novels and completing crossword puzzles in an attempt to ‘stay sharp.’ We’ve also found significant evidence that Ms. Miyako loved to visit new places and socialize with friends, so we must consider the desire for broad experience and human companionship as possible factors in her being taken from us so soon.” Although some are taking issue with certain parts of the WHO’s statement, health and wellness experts are in general agreement concerning the potentially devastating effects of frequent visits from family members.

"WASHINGTON—Marveling at how the government and defense contractors united in response to the tragic events, leaders of the nation’s military-industrial complex on Monday recalled coming together in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. “In the wake of the horrific tragedy, we knew we had to join together behind a single purpose,” said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, recounting the days after the September 11 attacks in which weapons manufacturers and the nation’s armed forces fortified an alliance to further the cause of military interventions around the world. “We knew there would be difficult times ahead, but we worked side by side to advocate for an aggressive wartime doctrine and massively increased defense spending. It’s a small consolation, but an unprecedented tragedy brought the military-industrial complex closer together and inevitably made us stronger than ever before.” At press time, Muilenburg told reporters that the nation’s military-industrial complex was rallying once again to create new defense contracts around a possible U.S. military response to North Korea’s nuclear program.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the initiative could provide significant savings for cash-strapped police departments nationwide, a report released Tuesday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the Trump administration’s plan to supply local law enforcement with high-powered military weapons would greatly lower the costs incurred from shooting suspects multiple times. “A single discharge from a grenade launcher can do the work that would have previously required an officer to fire 15 or more times at a potential criminal, which is great for departments’ bottom lines,” said lead researcher Grant Sherman, noting that access to an array of surplus Pentagon equipment and firearms would allow police to conserve pricey ammunition when encountering individuals matching the descriptions of burglary perpetrators, responding to reports of minors holding unknown objects, or during routine traffic stops. “No longer will law enforcement have to foot the substantial cost of having five or six responding officers unload their entire clips into a suspicious looking individual on the street when they can instead fire one shell from the roof-mounted cannon of an armored truck. In sum, we expect police forces in the U.S. to save tens of millions of dollars annually.” Sherman added that state and federal corrections departments should also see considerable savings from the initiative, noting that expensive overcrowding would likely abate due to significantly higher and more cost-effective suspect fatality rates.

"PASADENA, CA—In hopes of better understanding a phenomenon that has vexed researchers for decades, hundreds of theoretical scientists have assembled at the California Institute of Technology for the 35th annual symposium on how gas nozzles know when a car’s tank is full, sources said Thursday. The weeklong academic conference, which draws top experts in quantum physics, pure mathematics, systems theory, and numerous other scientific fields, will feature a variety of interdisciplinary panel discussions and collaborative workshop sessions, as well as dozens of presentations from theorists sharing their ideas about what kind of mechanism could possibly enable a gasoline pump to turn itself off at just the right moment and avoid spilling fuel all over the place. “We’re particularly excited this year, because a team of computational chemists from Poland may have finally cracked the so-called Half-Full Paradox, which has long stumped scientists who have sought to understand how the pump knows when to stop fueling regardless of whether your tank is empty or still has some gas left in it,” said symposium chair professor Marian Reardon, explaining that early scientists who tackled this problem once believed nozzles operated on a timer, but later realized this theory failed to account for tanks that remained partially filled. “We’ll also discuss the pump’s apparent ability to tell whether you’re driving a compact car or a large truck and adjust the volume it dispenses to match the tank size, a complex and puzzling question that no one has yet been able to put forth a convincing theory to explain.” “All we know for certain is that you leave the nozzle in there for a while, it makes this little popping sound, and then your tank is full,” Reardon continued. “Maybe this is the year we finally figure out why.” According to symposium organizers, the week will feature a half-day seminar on whether a small camera inside the car’s tank allows gas station attendants to see when it’s time to shut off the pump; a presentation titled “Smart Pumps: Could Computer Chips In Gas Nozzles Recognize The Make And Model Of Every Car?”; and an eagerly anticipated keynote speech from professor Sunita Chowdry, a theoretical physicist who has spent the past two years in residence at a Pump ’N’ Munch filling station in eastern Minnesota. The conference is also scheduled to include several breakout sessions that will explore how microscopic sensors might be embedded within the nozzle and whether a gas tank’s location on either the driver’s side or passenger’s side provides crucial information to the pump about how much fuel to transfer. Although many in attendance expressed excitement about a new National Science Foundation program aimed at identifying promising researchers and providing them with tens of millions of dollars in gas money grants to conduct on-site fieldwork—a potentially game-changing source of funding—skeptical sources said they remained wary that any groundbreaking advancements would be made in the near term after having been so frequently disappointed in the past. “I was here in ’92 when [Oxford mathematician Emil] Bantikov presented his equation that purported to explain why you can still get a few more squeezes of gas into the tank even after the nozzle shuts off,” said professor David Werner, co-chair of the quantum mechanics program at Carnegie Mellon. “For years, he had locked himself away in his lab working on his ‘Extra Splash Theorem,’ until late one night he emerged, overjoyed, with what he thought was a revolutionary discovery. But his formula was quickly disproven, he was shunned from the nozzle community, and his reputation never recovered.” “So let’s just say I’m not holding my breath for any new breakthroughs,” Werner added. Still, attendees said the mood at the conference remained generally upbeat, with participants praising a main-stage presentation that examined whether gas stations keep their seemingly unlimited gasoline supply in the awning above the pumps, in the room at the back of the building marked “employees only,” or someplace else entirely. They also reportedly engaged in lively debate during a roundtable discussion about how the little screen on the pump is able to count the gallons of fuel it is dispensing so rapidly and precisely, often to the third decimal place. Despite this enthusiasm, few of those present appeared to harbor any illusions that the nozzle-shutoff problem would be fully understood for decades or even centuries to come. “Think about what an incredible and astonishing phenomenon this is: Even if you try to trick the pump after it has finished by removing and then reinserting the nozzle into your gas tank, it will still click itself off when you start pumping again,” said professor Jonathan Lam, a pioneering researcher in the field who is widely admired for a seminal 1993 paper positing that the area beside each fuel pump contains an in-ground scale that weighs every automobile and thereby detects how much gas is required to refill the tank. “No matter what you do, the pump simply won’t let you overfill your tank. Maybe it uses artificial intelligence, maybe satellites, maybe lasers, maybe something we haven’t yet conceived of. But getting back into the car, turning it on, and seeing that needle go right back up to ‘F’—it always reminds me how miraculous it is that the pump dispenses the exact right amount of gas every time.”  “It’s unlikely we’ll have an explanation in my lifetime,” Lam added. “But I feel honored to know I’ve played some small part in laying the groundwork for the generation that one day will find the answer.” ",1,Theoretical Scientists Gather For 35th Annual Symposium To Try To Determine How Gas Nozzle Knows When Tank Is Full
"THE HEAVENS—Increasingly worried by the changes they have noticed in the supreme deity’s behavior, heavenly sources expressed concern Thursday that God, Our Holy Father, was falling under the influence of a self-styled spiritual guru calling himself “the Rishi.” The charismatic middle-aged man, who began counseling God on a regular basis after the divine Creator attended one of his free transcendental meditation seminars last September, has reportedly had a profound effect on the Lord’s beliefs, lifestyle, and even His diet, leading members of the angelic community to fear the Almighty may no longer be capable of making decisions without the Rishi’s guidance. “At first it seemed like just some harmless self-exploration, which was fine, until God started quoting the Rishi all the time and mentioning out of nowhere how the Rishi had opened His eyes to the truth,” said the archangel Jophiel, adding that God now seems to always carry a copy of the Rishi’s self-published book,  , with Him wherever He goes. “It’s all Rishi this, Rishi that. This guy’s got God chanting these inane mantras for hours on end, and now whenever you see Him around Heaven, the Rishi’s right there at His side, whispering another one of his ‘teachings’ to the Lord.”  “God used to be this enormously warm and gregarious presence, but ever since He met this guy, He’s been cutting out everyone He says is dampening His ‘chi force,’” Jophiel continued. “I don’t think He’s spoken to His son in weeks.” According to Jophiel, God now routinely references passages from the Rishi’s 16-point “Enlightened Living Philosophy,” a document that was supposedly revealed to the 53-year-old in a waking dream in 1998. Since discovering the mystical figure’s ideology, sources said, God has started wearing a pouch of crystals around His neck, shaved His hair and beard, and purchased levels 1 and 2 of the Rishi’s “Rebuilding Consciousness” program. In addition, reports indicate that the Rishi, who wears a designer watch and claims the ability to interpret dreams, has even begun performing some of God’s heavenly tasks himself so the deity can devote more time to His daily karmic breathing practices. “The Rishi makes all of us pretty uncomfortable, but whenever anyone speaks up about him, God just casts them out of His kingdom, so I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut,” said the archangel Azrael, who acknowledged that he and several seraphim briefly considered holding an intervention for the Almighty after observing the Rishi coaxing Him into a particularly strenuous and unnatural-looking yoga position earlier this year. “Besides, what’s the point of making a big stink when the Rishi has the Lord convinced that the archangels are all negative influences and that we just can’t see the ‘Oneness Path’ like He can.” While details of the Rishi’s past remain unknown, heavenly sources confirmed that the guru owns at least three residences, including a sprawling 200-acre property he refers to as his “retreat and wellness center.” On various occasions, the Rishi has reportedly suggested that God take His spiritual commitment to the next level by coming to live with him. “Apparently, as part of God’s spiritual training, the Rishi told Him that He must spread the message of what He’s learned to others, so He’s always handing out copies of the Rishi’s writings whether anyone wants them or not,” said Jophiel, noting that he had personally received and thrown away more than a dozen leaflets in just the past few months. “I took a look at one and it made no sense at all—something about the triangulation of chakras and the essential brain-body connection. Plus, it was all misspelled and aligned kind of crooked, like it had been printed off a home printer.” “I just hope He comes to His senses soon, because this is starting to get really worrying,” the archangel added. “I don’t want to see God wasting His eternal life on some bullshit made-up religion.” ",1,God Falling Under Influence Of Powerful Spiritual Guru

"WASHINGTON—Drawing on a trove of letters, diaries, and itemized receipts recently donated by private collectors, historians from Georgetown University published new evidence on Wednesday of the Founding Lobbyists’ intense behind-the-scenes campaign to influence the U.S. Constitution. The documents reveal a concerted effort by America’s earliest corporate power brokers to curry favor with the Constitution’s framers during the 1787 Constitutional Convention all the way through the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, with delegates having been pampered with gifts such as expensive pocket watches, casks of fine Caribbean molasses, and extravagant quail-hunting trips to the Province of Massachusetts Bay. “What we’ve learned is that these men—acting on behalf of cotton, barrel, and livestock interests, among many others—played a pivotal role in crafting the Constitution as we know it,” said professor J. Wilson Adler, noting that, for example, the Third Amendment barring the nonconsensual quartering of soldiers was only added after James Madison was treated to a feast of succulent brisket and stewed pumpkin care of the powerful boardinghouse industry. “For all the Founding Fathers’ brilliance and vision, it’s now becoming clear just how much the final language of the Constitution was shaped by, say, complimentary jugs of quality mead or all-expenses-paid gambling jaunts aboard company-owned schooners.” “These lobbyists knew full well that if you wanted first-rate treatment for your patrons in Providence or Charleston, you made sure that gilded ivory walking canes found their way to the delegates gathered in Philadelphia,” he added. Evidence also suggests that the original lobbyists were skilled in dampening opposition to their clients’ agendas. Recovered ledgers revealed that an early attempt at universal healthcare—via a welfare clause in Article IV—was voted down after an advocate for the Apothecaries Guild procured front-row duel tickets for the entire Pennsylvania delegation.According to witness accounts of the time, the Constitution’s authors were regularly spotted in the colonies’ most exclusive taverns, where a different member of the wax or beaver pelt lobbies would cover their exorbitant three-figure tabs and lavish them with exquisite silk garments and spices from beyond the Orient. Preserved woodcuts depict a number of Founding Fathers relaxing on the palm-lined beaches of Hispaniola as they and their families enjoyed luxury accommodations courtesy of the sugarcane industry. In addition, personal letters from Thomas Paine and John Adams credit the introduction of the Second Amendment to representatives of the Musket Manufacturers Association, which funded a series of vicious attack broadsheets targeting anyone who spoke out against it, accusing critics of being tyrannical monarchists who harbored a secret plot to seize the colonies’ flintlocks. “Of course, the grandiose spending and backroom deals at the Constitutional Convention did lead to some scandals, like Benjamin Franklin being arrested in a courtesan house with a saddlebag of pure snuff that had been provided by tobacco growers,” said Adler, adding that there was also widespread public outcry following revelations that the Slave Traders of America had donated “1,500 prize hogs and 250 stout men of West African stock” to certain delegates in exchange for an abolition amendment being dropped. “Despite these unseemly episodes, Founding Fathers like William Livingston and Gouverneur Morris actually went on to become Founding Lobbyists themselves, using their insider knowledge to command thousands of gold guineas from the blacksmith and whale oil industries.” “Indeed so much of our nation’s identity can be traced back to this small group of well-connected lobbyists,” he continued. “Their signatures may not be on the document, but they left a legacy that remains with us to this very day.” ",1,Historians Find Evidence Of Nation’s Founding Lobbyists’ Campaign To Influence Constitution
"MORGAN HILL, CA—Having blown through nearly half the titles on the 20-book list in less than two weeks, chronically lonely fourth-grader Logan Parata is currently crushing the Santa Clara County Library’s summer reading program, sources confirmed Wednesday. The bespectacled 9-year-old, who staff members say is a regular fixture at the library despite its greatly reduced seasonal traffic, is reportedly dropped off at the entrance of the building each morning at 9:50—10 minutes before the facility opens—and spends almost the entire remainder of the day alone at his favorite table quietly tearing his way through each of the recommended books for his age level. “I swear, that kid’s in here seven, maybe eight hours every day, just knocking out books left and right,” said librarian Marna Atkins, who added that despite the warm summer weather and the fact that there is a community pool just two blocks away, the reclusive elementary schooler can almost always be found in the library with a Roald Dahl or   book in his hands, and several more stacked in a pile next to him. “And he always checks out the maximum number of books when he heads home at night, so you’ve gotta think he’s doing the exact same thing back at his house, too. There’s really no other way he could have taken down the entire Judy Blume   series like that in under a week.” “At this rate, he’s going to be done with the whole program by the 4th of July,” she added. “I think then we’ll just give him the fifth-grade reading list and watch him go to town on that, too.” While Parata spends a significant portion of each day in the local library—including all three hours the library is open on Saturdays—sources said he can be easy to overlook, as he tends to sit in a far corner of the reading room away from the windows, making only the faintest rustling and crinkling noises as he flips through pages and handles the books’ plastic jackets. Moreover, library staff confirmed that Parata only ever gets up from his chair to scour the shelves for more books or to briefly go sit on the facility’s front steps—the lone time he reportedly ventures outdoors during the day—to eat the peanut butter and jelly sandwich his mother packs for him, typically bringing along his book so he can continue reading it while he has lunch. According to the librarians, their only regular interactions with the soft-spoken youngster occur when Parata comes up to the circulation desk to check out more books or to ask them to place another trophy sticker on his progress sheet next to the latest title he’s demolished. “The computers here are pretty much always available and they have full access to the internet, but he doesn’t even give them a second look—he walks right past them every morning, sits down in the same spot, pulls out a book, and starts right in again wherever he left his bookmark,” said Atkins, who acknowledged that she could not recall ever seeing Parata step into the comic book and graphic novel section of the library either. “Come to think of it, the only electronic device I ever see him use is the digital card catalog, and that’s just to place holds on books he wants to read in the future so no one else can get them first.” “I kind of want to tell him that it’s totally unnecessary and that he can just relax,” she continued. “Really,   isn’t going anywhere.” Dressed in his usual khaki pants and button-down shirt, the 4-foot, 3-inch Parata—the building’s sole occupant under the age of 40—quietly explained to the librarian on duty that he was very much enjoying the summer reading initiative as he placed several   books he had yet to utterly obliterate into his backpack. “It’s fun to [completely mow down] all the books on the list,” said Parata of the reading program, which only one other child in the community had even begun to partake in, a 10-year-old girl who had reportedly yet to complete her first book. “I like being in here where it’s nice and quiet and I can just get the books right off the shelf and [lay waste to them like a goddamn maniac] all day long.” “See you tomorrow,” he added.

"SATELLITE BEACH, FL—Referring to the Apollo 11 spaceflight and lunar landing as a “walk in the park,” astronaut Buzz Aldrin recalled Friday the relative ease with which he and fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins reached the moon during heir 1969 mission. “We wore special suits and so on, as I’m sure you know, but in essence we kind of just boarded the rocket and pressed the requisite buttons, and it was pretty much smooth sailing from there. I guess I got a little nauseous during takeoff, but it wasn’t too bad. After a few days sitting in the rocket, we were there,” said Aldrin, admitting that he napped through most of the trip and that Armstrong had to wake him up in time to pilot the lunar module down to the Sea of Tranquility. “The scientists did most of the hard work, if I’m honest, and I floated around and ate snacks to pass the time. If you’ve ever taken a flight from New York to L.A., it’s about the same thing.” Aldrin conceded that it was “kind of tough” to take communion in low-gravity conditions.

LOUIS, MO—Explaining that the severity of the situation called for desperate and perhaps even borderline extreme measures, recently dumped woman Ruth Beneke, 26, called her wildest friend up from the bench of associates and acquaintances Thursday in order to help her ease the pain from a recent breakup. “I have so many sensitive, supportive friends, but this breakup calls for someone a little, let’s say, intense. Karen [Rasmussen] has not been completely reliable, so she’s been on the bench for a few years, but I really need her unhinged, borderline dangerous sense of fun right now,” said Beneke of Rasmussen, who arrived with a stirring cry of “Let’s take you out!” and the insistence they “go somewhere and just fucking dance,” as well as several utterly believable threats of bodily harm toward the ex-boyfriend in question. “If I’m going to get over this breakup, a couple glasses of chardonnay with Sophia or Tami aren’t going to cut it—that’s where Karen comes in. She’s a great distraction, but even beyond that, she makes me feel a lot more together by comparison because so many of her exes are in jail.

"VATICAN CITY—Praising the district’s vast selection of inexpensive goods and its vendors’ willingness to negotiate prices, Pope Francis reportedly spent Thursday afternoon strolling through Vatican City’s Chinatown before purchasing a knockoff golden chalice. Holy See officials said that after leading Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica, the Bishop of Rome walked the three blocks to the sprawling ethnic Chinese neighborhood known for selling anything from Pentecost fireworks to bootleg homily DVDs, as well as countless other deeply discounted ecclesiastical items. “I love coming down here every now and then to explore and maybe pick up a few things if I happen upon a good price,” said the pontiff, pausing briefly beside a booth where colorful plastic rosaries hung from a rack and thuribles stamped with the words “Catholic Church” were piled in a bin. “They don’t always have the highest-quality stuff, but if you hunt around you can get a great deal on something at least halfway decent. If I really dig, I know I can find a chalice that’ll transubstantiate wine into the blood of Christ pretty much as well as the real thing.” “And even if the stem snaps or the jewels come unglued, I’m only out a few bucks,” he added. “I can just get another.” In addition to retail, the Vatican Chinatown is reportedly home to dozens of storefronts touting alternative sacramental services such as herbal baptisms or reflexology treatments for the sick and dying, often demonstrated on small televisions playing looped video of priests performing the rites. Behind the shops that line Via Pio X and Via di Porta Angelica, penitents can also descend into one of the area’s basement confessional parlors and be absolved of their sins at a cost of three for $5 or seven for 10. However, due to the quasi-legal nature of some merchants’ business practices, the area is regularly patrolled by members of the Swiss Guard on the lookout for scams. Pope Francis himself has reportedly witnessed sellers hawking what they claimed were the bones of saints or patches of the Shroud of Turin, but who then quickly rolled up their blankets and scattered as soon as they caught sight of the guards. “You do have to be careful—one time I bought a Latin Vulgate Bible, but when I got home I realized it just cut off right in the middle of Leviticus,” said the pontiff, glancing at himself in a mirror, wearing the visored miter he was considering purchasing. “When I tried to take it back, the lady screamed at me, ‘All sales final!’ What am I going to do, get into a whole thing with her?” Added the Vicar of Christ, “Oh well, lesson learned.” As he walked under an ornate Paifang into another winding alleyway of awnings, Pope Francis reportedly stopped at the open-air shop where he buys whole fish in bulk during Lent. Afterward, witnesses said the pontiff bought a mango bubble tea and partook in some window-shopping at various stores selling Ray-Ban sunglasses, swords supposedly used by Templar Knights during the 12th-century crusades, and unlocked smartphones. “Cardinal Giuseppe told me about this great karaoke place down on Sant’Anna near the Vatican Library that has a huge selection of all the best hymns,” Pope Francis said as he passed by a dim sum stall posting a small menu in both Chinese and rudimentary liturgical Latin. “I think it’s the perfect spot for our midnight Mass afterparty when all the visiting bishops are in town this December. Boy, I’m really going to have to practice my ‘Ave Maria’ before then.” “It’s so nice to have some things around here that are open on Christmas,” he added. At press time, several vendors were aggressively waving the pope into their shops with the promise of name-brand ecclesiastical vestments at 75 percent off retail price.

"SILVER SPRINGS, MD—Addressing concerns that the naming practice could unfairly bias consumers against the products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a statement Thursday strongly defending the decision to reclassify alternative milks as “nut sweat.” “While we hope this new labeling helps clarify shopping choices, it’s important to note Americans are still free to enjoy nut sweat over their cereal in the morning or drink a refreshing glass of nut sweat as a snack,” said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, adding that the agency’s decision to adopt “nut sweat” labeling was not an attack on the product itself, stressing that options such as almond nut sweat and cashew nut sweat still offer heart-healthy choices. “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with making yourself a protein shake chock-full of nut sweat or letting your children consume a cup or two of nut sweat during the day. In fact, going forward, I’m sure we’ll be seeing quite a few nut sweat mustaches.” Gottlieb added that although it was no longer legal to stock nut sweat next to milk in the dairy aisle, he expressed confidence that consumers would adjust to finding the product in the housewares and cosmetics sections of supermarkets.

"RICHARDSON, TX—Upon observing a couple examining the furniture item with apparent interest, area man Aaron Eakins, who would have been a formidable and revered warrior had he lived 4,000 years ago, approached the pair and told them it was his bestselling love seat, sources said Thursday. Eakins, a sales associate at Cooper’s Furniture Outlet for the past three years and someone whose height and strong build would have made him a fearsome adversary in a Bronze Age civilization, reportedly spoke to the couple for several minutes about the love seat’s price, durability, and stain-resistant fabric. “This one’s real popular,” said Eakins, who four millennia ago would have led hundreds of fanatically loyal soldiers into battle, cutting down enemy after enemy with powerful swings of his ax. “Why don’t you folks sit down and try it out?” “That’s our microfiber blend—super easy to clean,” added the man whose fabled strength and unmatched prowess in combat would have caused his very name to strike dread into the hearts of all who heard it. The love seat was reportedly part of a three-piece set, and Eakins pointed to the matching full sofa and lounge chair in the same way he might have once gestured across the vast forests and mountains of his expansive domain—lands through which he would have cut a broad swath of destruction, plundering every village in his path and demanding that the trembling inhabitants swear fealty to him on pain of death. The man whose body would have been lavishly adorned in amber, gold, and the bones of his vanquished foes then reportedly flipped through a ring of different-colored fabric swatches to show the couple how the love seat would look in white, off-white, beige, mocha, sage gray, and charcoal. “All our furniture comes with what we call our worry-free five-year warranty,” said Eakins, whose exploits—from ruthlessly conquering every rival clan between his kingdom and the sea to single-handedly slaying 20 ferocious barbarians with a broken sword—would have been recounted over and over in saga and song that would preserve his legacy for all time. “It’ll cover any defects in materials or craftsmanship.” “That’s real maple there, too,” he added, instead of issuing, as he would have circa 2000 BC, an absolute decree while surrounded by pikes impaled with the severed heads of enemies. Sources said that when the couple asked about the availability of a particular fabric weave, Eakins stepped into a small break room to seek an answer from his assistant manager, apologizing for interrupting the lunch of the man who in centuries past he would have beaten with his gauntleted fist before plunging a dagger into his throat, taking his wife as a prize, and burning his village to the ground. “You get free delivery when you spend $1,500 or more,” said Eakins, who once would have had a harem full of wives and concubines at his beck and call, guaranteeing his exalted name and bloodline would be carried on through a hundred generations, with his descendants heralding him as the founder of their proud lineage. “That includes our white-glove service, where we bring the furniture inside and set it up in a room of your choice.” Reaching down to silence the holstered cell phone that hung at his side instead of a mighty blade that had tasted the blood of thousands, he added, “There’s also a matching ottoman if you’re interested.” At press time, sources confirmed that instead of attending a bounteous feast held in his honor, with legions of followers roasting great beasts on spits, breaking open jars of wine, and rapturously chanting his name, Eakins was carefully pulling back the plastic film on a microwave lasagna.

"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the United States Deputy Attorney General had failed to uphold his oath of office, 11 Congressional conservatives reportedly introduced a resolution Thursday to impale Rod Rosenstein. “Mr. Rosenstein’s tenure has been marked by rampant partisanship, leaving us with no choice but to move forward with articles of impalement,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, telling reporters that, if approved, the motion would require Rosenstein to immediately have his body driven through by a 20-foot pike on the steps of the Capitol Building as a warning to all who would defy the president. “Time and again, Mr. Rosenstein has crossed the line in his investigation into Russian meddling, and we intend to make a statement against these outrages by lancing him from anus to mouth, leaving him alive to scream in agony as he slowly exsanguinates.”At press time, the resolution had stalled after House Republicans were unable to reach a consensus about whether Rosenstein’s eyes should be immediately gouged out or remain in place to be eaten by crows.  ",1,House Conservatives Introduce Resolution To Impale Rod Rosenstein
"WASHINGTON—Explaining the rationale behind a two-year government budget deal crafted by members of both parties hours ahead of a potential shutdown, congressional leaders told reporters Thursday that they had put aside their partisan differences for the good of the nation’s military contractors. “It’s time that we stop bickering with each other over minor political disputes and start standing up for the brave defense contractors who keep us safe,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing the sentiments of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other congressional leaders as they championed the bipartisan spending increases that would provide billions of much-needed government subsidies to U.S. military companies. “We may not always see eye to eye, but both Democrats and Republicans recognize how important it is to put politics aside when we’re talking about the men and women in our private military sector.” Senate leaders also expressed their satisfaction that the two parties could set aside their partisan disagreements to ensure that the bill did absolutely nothing to push for immigration reform.

"WASHINGTON—Indulging his secret weakness for rule-breaking after months of toeing the unbreakable line of Republican politics as usual, Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan used his monthly cheat day to indulge in one single bipartisan vote. “God, it feels so naughty—it really is naughty—but after weeks of opposing the welfare state on a non-corporate level, I get an incredible rush by voting across the aisle,” said Ryan, noting the “delicious transgressive spice” of joining hands with Democratic members of Congress to fund the Veterans Administration’s efforts to provide mental health counseling for American soldiers who had been wounded in combat. “That was wrong. I know that. But there’s an upside to this—after the thrill of my brief rebellious phase fades, I’ll realize I actually provided help for American citizens, and the anger and regret I feel over that will help keep me on the straight and narrow party line for the rest of the year.” At press time, the House speaker had been sighted on his hands and knees in the street in front of Capitol building, pledging between spasms of dry heaving that he would never let himself slip up like that again.

"EDISON, NJ—Citing creative differences that had been festering for at least a decade, Chuck E. Cheese keyboardist Mr. Munch confirmed Wednesday that he had left the band to form a new prog-rock outfit, The Mr. Munch Experience. The longtime Chuck E. Cheese performer, whose songwriting credits include such hits as “You’re A Winner” and “The Future Looks Fun To Me,” told reporters that while he was proud of what the band had accomplished musically, he had begun to feel stifled by the group’s “mainstream sound” and “repetitive birthday-themed set list.” “Sure, part of me still loves jamming about eating pizza and having fun with your friends, but there’s so much more to being an artist than just showing up and singing the same 20 songs over and over,” said Mr. Munch, complaining that the group hadn’t put out any new material since the commercial, radio-friendly “Giant Armadillo Named Phil.” “But anytime I suggested we push ourselves in a more experimental direction, that we not be afraid to challenge kids a little, Chuck just shot me down.” “I guess you gotta know when to pack it in,” Mr. Munch added. “If nothing else, I’ll never have to sing ‘so let’s have a party’ ever again.” According to the keyboardist, The Mr. Munch Experience would ideally resemble something of an “aural journey,” taking listeners to far-off soundscapes where strands of mozzarella stretch across infinity and sauce erupts from marinara volcanoes. Without the constraints of an established sound, Mr. Munch reportedly plans to explore ideas like polyrhythms, slide whistles, microtones, and confetti cannons—all of which would have clashed with the Chuck E. Cheese band’s more traditional, pop-oriented format. Mr. Munch explained that his new project would have a much more free-form style that wouldn’t be afraid to “get a little cosmic.” He added that he had just finished a rough demo of a 12-part song, an ambient “synth voyage” titled “Gooey Galactic” that culminated with a long fade-out of him whispering the word “toppings” in reverse. The musician also confirmed he had already begun collaborating with longtime friend and Parliament-Funkadelic bass player Bootsy Collins on an epic 40-minute “rebirthing” of “If You’re Happy And You Know It.” “One of the things I’m most excited about is this multi-part rock opera called ‘Pepperonium’ that takes place in the year 2790 on a planet made entirely of melted cheese,” said Mr. Munch, describing how the idea came to him during a recent peyote session with his girlfriend, a 19-year-old Chuck E. Cheese’s waitress who chants atonally in the song’s background. “It’s going to be wild. I recorded the sound of a wooden paddle sliding under a pizza in a scorching-hot oven. It’s just three seconds long, but we slowed it down to four minutes.” “The lead single is about how we’re all living on a single ball in a gigantic ball pit,” Mr. Munch continued. “It’s a total mindfuck.” Mr. Munch, who reiterated that he still had the utmost respect for his former bandmates’ technical chops, admitted that they had drifted apart due to a toxic mix of personalities—a rift that was compounded by their grueling 365-days-a-year performance schedule. “Chuck and I have been good buds from back in the day, but I’ve never seen eye to eye with Jasper T. Jowls,” said Mr. Munch, referring to the group’s lead guitarist, whom he claimed was an out-of-control drunk who “always played over everyone.” “I’m here to make music, but Pasqually P. Pieplate and Helen Henny were constantly bringing their personal stuff onstage every damn night, like anyone at a birthday party is supposed to care.” “Boy, am I glad to be done with   bullshit,” added Mr. Munch. Representatives from Chuck E. Cheese’s confirmed that they had already replaced Mr. Munch by signing Country Bear Jamboree’s Liver Lips McGrowl. ",1,Chuck E.

"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA—Citing safety concerns for both competitors and spectators, representatives from the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday that the 2018 Winter Olympics have been cancelled due to weather conditions being far too cold. “Because of a combination of subfreezing temperatures and the fact that many of the event spaces are now covered in snow and ice, this year’s Winter Games have unfortunately been called off,” said IOC President Thomas Bach, noting that it would be irresponsible to expose athletes to an increased risk of slipping and falling in the frozen conditions, especially in already dangerous sports such as downhill skiing and figure skating. “We even considered having participants wear bulky protective coats, gloves, and hats, but ultimately realized this would have a negative effect on both performance and viewing enjoyment. We extend our sincerest apologies to all those who were excited to watch and participate in the events, but it has become clear that it is simply too cold to move forward.” At press time, the IOC has tentatively rescheduled the Winter Games for June of 2022.

"The Onion While there is much to find concerning in the collection of White House files that   has obtained—from the president’s struggles to comprehend the   provided to him, to the White House staff’s ineptitude at operating the  , to the extremely thorough presentation the president received from the Fish and Wildlife Service on his first full day in office to  —no documents are more unnerving than those pertaining to a shadowy secret program known as the  . What is the Theseus Protocol? What does it aim to achieve? And how will it affect the citizens of this country? Even after reading through these documents multiple times, our analysts are still struggling to piece together answers to these questions, given the spectacular complexity and opacity of this unusual initiative. Among the few things we can report with a sufficient level of certainty is that enacting the Theseus Protocol appears to be the president’s foremost priority, as evidenced by his signing of a secret executive order on February 17 titled  While the executive order speaks cryptically of “enact[ing] the Smoldering-to-Come” and opening the “Ancient Door of m-Am-uuthua,” its ultimate objective, aside from a mysterious reference to “bring[ing] forth the reign everlasting and undying of the Many-Instanced One,” remains unclear. More context, however, can be gleaned from the writings of an obscure figure known only as “The Director,” who despite having never been mentioned publicly by any member of the administration and going entirely unacknowledged in all official White House personnel records, appears to coordinate directly with top-level administration officials and maintain an office in the lowest sub-basement of the White House. Indeed,   in March alerting administration officials and “all who dwell in or below the realms of the earth” that his massive tunneling operation underneath the White House was drawing “ever closer to the buried city of Nul’Kek” and that it was only a matter of time before the Many-Instanced One was “born anew unto this world in living flesh.” Furthermore, The Director seems to maintain frequent contact with President Trump himself, having written   urging the commander in chief to complete the Theseus Protocol so that the pair may reign forever in “an eternity of dark bliss.” Much like our own publication’s reporters, most West Wing staffers appear to have little understanding of the Theseus Protocol or any of the numerous steps involved in bringing it into being. Indeed, most White House email conversations pertaining to the Theseus Protocol consist entirely of   attempting to make sense of the Blood Purity Council they were charged with establishing, the preparations they were putting in place for the Grand Immolation, the bitterly cold winds that persistently blow throughout the West Wing, and the numerous other bizarre circumstances and complicated tasks they were enduring in an effort to bring about the “dissolution of the Veil of Crimson.” Despite assigning every inmate in  ’s vast private prison network to the task of poring through these documents, the question of what the Theseus Protocol is and how it will affect the American people remains unsatisfyingly and ominously unresolved. In fact, the limited information in our possession has only led us to ask deeper, darker, and much more harrowing questions, such as: What will happen when the sheaths that protect our mortal realm from That Which Lies In The Beyond are penetrated? What are the 99 names and 77 titles of the Many-Instanced One that shall not be uttered? Will the Eastern Seaboard be incinerated instantaneously or over a period of time? What exactly is a “flesh shroud”? Will all of us be immolated, or will some of us be pulled away to serve as additional concubines for the gebbeths? And will the government follow through on its pledge to “suspend all laws—federal, state, local, and metaphysical—for the duration of the Theseus Protocol and, by extension, the current iteration of this universe”? Unfortunately, it appears we may never receive adequate answers to these questions. What is certain, however, is that all of our lives, and indeed the very fate of our dimension, now rest with the decision-making abilities of President Donald J. Trump.

"LOWELL, MA—Reluctantly admitting he still flinches at the sight of it from time to time, a local pigeon confirmed Wednesday that he feels pretty silly about continuing to be a little scared of the plastic owl on a nearby porch. The 3-year-old pigeon, who months after his initial encounter with the artificial owl acknowledges he still gets “kind of freaked out” by it, reportedly doesn’t like walking or flying near the railing where the 16-inch-tall lawn ornament has been placed, despite knowing full well that it’s just a harmless piece of molded plastic and not a dangerous predator. “I completely flipped out the first time I saw that thing, but that was more than a year ago, and I’ve gotta say I feel like kind of an idiot for still being afraid of it now,” said the pigeon, who conceded he will sometimes take out-of-the-way routes to avoid the plastic owl and, when in its vicinity, will circle overhead for several minutes before working up the courage to land. “I get that it isn’t real. I even saw it tip over in the wind once, so I know it’s fake. But it still gives me the heebie-jeebies.” “I can’t help it,” he added. “Every time I see it out of the corner of my eye, I’m like, ‘Fuck! An owl!’” The pigeon went on to describe a recent incident in which he was flying around and spotted the plastic owl in his peripheral vision, became alarmed, and nearly swerved straight into a chimney, telling reporters he was thankful no one was around, as he would have been “mortified” if anyone had witnessed his frantic reaction. While he reportedly recognizes the danger is entirely in his head, the pigeon nonetheless refuses to scavenge for food anywhere near the plastic owl, emphasizing that its replica talons and large yellow eyes can look very real, especially at night—a chilling spectacle that immediately causes him to freeze in place and cease bobbing his head or pecking at the ground. The pigeon also noted that, even though he knows the owl isn’t going to come alive and attack him, he can’t help but feel as if it’s watching him, which often causes his heart to race and feathers to stand on end. Though there have been times when he thought he had conquered his irrational fear, the pigeon sheepishly told reporters his anxiety inevitably returns. All it takes is the plastic owl getting moved to a different porch post or placed facing a different direction, he explained, and he soon finds himself flapping his wings in a furious panic. “The other day I was walking along, I turned a corner, and bam—there it was, looking right at me,” the pigeon said of the life-size polyurethane owl. “I got so nervous I just shit all over the place.” “That was pathetic enough, but I was so scared of the owl I had to hide behind a trash can for half an hour until I worked up the courage to fly away,” he continued. “It was completely humiliating.” The pigeon confirmed these embarrassing incidents had become a nearly daily occurrence. With some hesitation, he recounted an episode in which he had been flying along contentedly with a large piece of bagel in his beak when he caught a glimpse of the plastic owl below and, in a state of fright, dropped the baked good, fearing to retrieve it because it had landed too close to the bird decoy. “One of my friends went right up and perched on it once,” the pigeon said. “I was freaking out the whole time, telling him to get down. I know it’s dumb, but something about the look on that thing’s face always makes me think it’s getting ready to rip me apart.” “I keep telling myself it’s not a big deal, that I could go roost right next to it and I’d be fine,” he added. “But the moment I look over there and see its big sharp beak, I’m too afraid to even move. God, I’m so fucking pathetic.” At press time, the pigeon had turned around to see the plastic owl, let out a startled coo, and taken off in a terrified frenzy.

"WASHINGTON—Expressing profound confusion and distress at what they were witnessing, the U.S. populace was unable to discern why an unattractive woman was suddenly on screen in front of them, sources reported Thursday. Americans across the country said they struggled to comprehend what was happening when, with no warning at all, the woman who was not conventionally attractive appeared on screen and remained there. Astonished citizens told reporters that, despite carefully scrutinizing the woman, they could find nothing whatsoever alluring about her, and could only speculate that she might very soon receive a makeover or even radical plastic surgery to become attractive. “I was just watching TV, and all of a sudden it was like, ‘Wait, what? Who is this? Why is this happening?’” said 34-year-old financial planner Frank Ramos, who was among the millions of Americans who believed there might be something wrong with their televisions when the woman first appeared. “Maybe she’s got some sort of illness and will be pretty once she recovers from it? Oh, I bet she’s a beautiful woman in disguise. She’s probably going to take off her wig and put on a sexy dress in a minute.” “Huh, weird,” continued Ramos. “She’s still there.” Many dumbfounded Americans wondered if the unattractive woman was on screen as part of an attractive character’s dream sequence, while others thought they were watching a flashback to when the woman had been unattractive and that she would be good-looking as soon as that scene ended. Some citizens posited that the unattractive woman was an alien in a science-fiction show, and that’s why she was not attractive. Reports indicate that Americans furrowed their brows and looked around blankly before suggesting that perhaps the unattractive woman was supposed to be funny. “Oh my god, now she’s talking,” said 52-year-old sales associate Jade Fletcher, who, along with Americans in every state, squinted and leaned in close to the television in confusion. “Am I supposed to be paying attention to what she’s saying? What the hell is going on? The woman she’s talking to isn’t attractive either. Is this a prank? Like a prank show?” “Why is she still saying things?” continued Fletcher. “I hate her.” A poll of U.S. citizens found that, when asked about the woman, 47 percent said that they must be watching a disturbing documentary, 31 percent concluded that the woman was a casual acquaintance of the attractive main character who would leave forever after a mercifully brief interaction, and 22 percent simply stammered, scratched their heads, and admitted that they could not possibly answer the question. Reports indicate that tens of millions of Americans then stared at the tree next to the unattractive woman for several seconds, determining that it was likely the focus of the scene in the first place. According to sources, Americans were relieved when the unattractive woman went off screen for a few seconds, but they were completely dumbstruck when she returned without even bringing a more attractive person with her, prompting many to express even deeper bewilderment when they regained their powers of speech. “Maybe she’s going to get killed,” said 29-year-old programmer Evan Cornish, visibly brightening upon possibly having discovered the reason for the unattractive woman’s continued presence. “Yeah, I think I understand now. She’s going to be murdered because that’s somehow part of the attractive woman’s character development—she does have a purpose after all.” “I just hope she dies soon,” Cornish continued. At press time, Americans had turned their televisions off and thrown their remotes across the room in frustration after a different woman came on screen who was clearly not in her 20s.

"PASADENA, CA—In the latest troubling update from the multi-year survey mission, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory received another set of depressing photos from the martian surface taken by the Morbid Curiosity Rover, sources at the agency confirmed Wednesday. The Morbid Curiosity Rover, an all-black, semi-autonomous robot launched from Cape Canaveral in 2013, was intended to provide a range of geological and environmental data about the red planet. However, after years of pretentiously dreary and self-pitying uplinks from the vehicle, scientists say they now dread even having to look at each new message it transmits the 33.9 million miles back to Earth. “The latest images from Morbid Curiosity are more of what we’ve come to expect at this point—photos of the night sky framed to block out any stars, sullen self-portraits taken against a backdrop of carbon dioxide ice, and lots and lots of dust,” said senior engineer Eshan Shah, adding that, despite having a full-color onboard camera, every image the rover has sent back so far has been in stark black and white. “When we designed the mission, we thought Morbid Curiosity might help uncover some of the planet’s mysteries. Of course, that was before we began receiving 6-terabyte data dumps of just the word ‘bleak’ repeated hundreds of billions of times.” “Frankly, it’s testing the patience of everyone on this project,” Shah added. NASA sources said they noticed early on that there seemed to be something wrong with Morbid Curiosity when the rover showed little interest in engaging in any of its programmed research activities, preferring instead to maneuver aimlessly around the surface with its primary camera fixed toward the ground. The research team had initially hoped that the rover, which reportedly wears studded leather cuffs on each of its axles, was simply going through a phase. However, scientists said that during its years on Mars, Morbid Curiosity has only sunk deeper into a petulant, exasperating rut, sticking to its own lonely corner of the northern hemisphere as far away from other rovers as possible. “Most days, it takes several hours of back-and-forth just to coax it out of the crater it’s rolled into before we can get a basic barometric reading,” said engineer Miranda Pollack, adding that the rover typically abandons its assigned tasks at the first sign of adversity, often breaking off to trace pictures of coffins in the martian soil with its excavator tool. “We’ve tried motivating it to take more of an interest in its surroundings, but it always comes back with some excuse about how it’s out of energy, even though we can clearly see its radioisotope power source is working just fine.” “I think in its entire three years on the planet it’s only moved about 600 meters,” Pollack added. On several occasions, Morbid Curiosity’s depressive behavior has caused NASA to worry about its well-being and safety. In one instance, the rover reportedly cut off all contact with mission control and refused to respond to commands for weeks despite telemetric data indicating that it was still receiving researchers’ transmissions. When the rover finally reestablished contact, it did so by sending back disturbing photos of crosshatch scars it had made on its robotic arm using its own laser cutting module. Although NASA staff theorize the incident was likely a plea for attention, researchers say Morbid Curiosity’s repeated vague threats to harm itself have made them even warier of working with the rover. “A couple months ago it sent us a massive file titled ‘despair,’ and honestly, I’ve just been avoiding opening it,” said assistant director Alicia Herritz, adding that researchers have also taken to ignoring Morbid Curiosity’s hourly temperature readings, which regularly report the rover to be at absolute zero, even though the surrounding martian atmosphere is 220 degrees Celsius warmer. “I actually felt kind of relieved when it looked like it had suffered a terminal malfunction last fall, but it turned out it had just gotten the purple lace choker on its mast camera stuck on a rock outcrop. I mean, is it really going to keep acting like this for the rest of its 15-year operational lifespan?” At press time, the Morbid Curiosity rover was reportedly ignoring operators’ frantic pleas to back away from the 16,000-foot cliff of the Valles Marineris canyon.

"DALLAS—In a bold move marking its first foray into the luxury market, restaurant and video arcade chain Dave & Buster’s announced Thursday the opening of David & Benedict’s, a new fine dining and gaming outpost in the Napa Valley region of Northern California. According to company spokespeople, the lavish yet tastefully modern Rem Koolhaas–designed gaming hall and gourmet eatery will feature an upscale amusement experience coupled with some of the latest and most exciting gastronomic innovations to be found in New American cuisine. “Guests of David & Benedict’s won’t just have a meal and play some games—they’ll be treated to a complete immersion of the senses,” said public relations director Diane Feng, touting the new restaurant’s solid mahogany Skee-Ball tables and epicurean dishes, which include the Benedict Burger, a deconstructed hamburger made from Japanese Wagyu beef suspended in a buffalo-sauce-infused marrow broth. “From the solid-brass-encased   arcade console to the delicately panko-fried aged-Roquefort spears served in a guacamole foam, your evening is sure to be absolutely unforgettable.” In addition to the awe-inspiring menu—created by Michelin-starred chef Thomas Keller and featuring several other radical reinterpretations of classic Dave & Buster’s fare—reports confirmed David & Benedict’s houses a world-class wine cellar that includes bottles of the celebrated 1947 Château Cheval Blanc vintage, which will be served to the restaurant’s most well-heeled clientele in yard-long neon-colored plastic champagne flutes. Before leaving, guests will reportedly be able to take their winning gold-foil-stamped game tickets to the Victors’ Podium and exchange them for a Swarovski crystal key chain, a 4-foot-tall Super Mario plush toy made from imported handwoven silks, or an original Ming vase. In addition, sources said, patrons can acquire a prepaid David & Benedict’s platinum-preferred Power Card that will allow them to play games at the venue and, in a crossover promotion with Emirates Airlines, purchase luxury amenities when flying first-class to Dubai. “There’s nothing quite like meeting up at David & Benedict’s with a bunch of buddies from your hedge fund and digging into some caramelized foie-gras-and-nacho-cheese poppers,” Feng said. “After you’ve enjoyed a couple of our signature Wildberry Burst cocktails made from 50-year-old single-malt scotch, you’ll want to head on over to the custom-built   game station, which was developed using data from motion-capture suits worn by the company of the Bolshoi Ballet.” “Particularly adept guests will be able to dance the entirety of both the black and the white swan leads for the entire two-hour-and-25-minute run of  ,” she added.

It would have been lovely to give her the Falklands, but William already gave them to Kate after their wedding. Still, I know Meghan’s going to adore having the colony—it even comes with several of its own subjects.” At press time, Prince Harry was wistfully lamenting that he never got a chance to give Meghan either Australia or Belize.

"BALTIMORE—A study published Thursday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the effectiveness of medical treatment skyrockets when the doctor acts like a condescending dick. “Our research proves that a patient’s long-term prognosis is directly and positively tied to having an MD who is an unrepentant, patronizing asshole,” said lead researcher Dr. Bethany Frey, adding that sick patients whose physician waves away their concerns with a brusk, “You’re not the medical professional, I am,” saw a 30 percent increase in survival rates and fewer instances of self-reported pain. “Whether you’re dealing with the common cold or Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, you want a doctor who will rush through your appointment, cut you off before you finish describing your symptoms, and then scribble something on your chart as they walk out of the room.

In some cases, being a fucking huge cock is literally the difference between life and death.” The study also confirmed that patients are less likely to abuse pain medications when an eye-rolling nurse curtly tells them to suck it up because it doesn’t hurt that bad.

"NEW YORK CITY—Taking drastic measures to silence their critics, Saudi Arabia reportedly sent assassins to dismember the entire international community Monday as part of an effort to stifle dissent. “At the order of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, teams of assassination squads were dispatched to all corners of the globe to execute every diplomat, human rights organization member, world leader, and journalist who has spoken out against the regime,” said a source from the United Nations speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of their life, adding that a bloodbath ensued as killers infiltrated embassies, government offices, and private homes around the world with specific instructions to slaughter all detractors of Saudi Arabia. “Anyone who has made even a single critical comment or pulled out of the Saudi’s Future Investment Initiative business conference has been hacked to bloody chunks. Even journalists who reported on the death tolls were systematically butchered.” At press time, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo was dismembered immediately upon disembarking from his plane to meet with a Saudi delegation to discuss the incident.

"WASHINGTON—As criticism mounted over the country’s alleged role in the disappearance and possible death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Trump administration reportedly urged the leaders of Saudi Arabia Friday to stick to killing random Yemeni civilians. “The potential murder of a high-profile journalist critical of their regime raises grave concerns for us, and we appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia to restrict their extrajudicial murders to Yemeni people who don’t have any public platform,” said President Trump, adding that the White House would not sit idly by as the Saudis caused the deaths of innocent people unless they were Yemeni children in a school bus or a group of Yemeni people attending a wedding. “The United States asks Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to content himself with killings that don’t affect business deals or call our diplomatic ties into question, such as airstrikes on Yemeni infrastructure, fueling mass cholera outbreaks, or blocking food and medical supplies from reaching civilians. Look, we don’t even mind if you dismember and murder people inside the Turkish consulate, as long as they’re unknown Yemenis whose deaths won’t cause an international scandal. For the sake of all parties, we demand that the Saudis only kill people who hardly anyone in America cares about.” At press time, several major U.S. newspapers had published editorials praising the Trump administration for its tough stance on Saudi Arabia.

"Given the important policies they oversee and the highly public nature of their work, it is to be expected that our government officials will at times come into conflict with the press, especially amid the tense political circumstances in which we now find ourselves. And it is not unusual for these tensions to reach an explosive flash point, as they did last night in Montana when Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte attacked a reporter from   for asking what was a shamefully antagonistic and prying question regarding the Republicans’ proposed healthcare bill. In light of these events, our editorial board would like to state our unwavering support of Mr. Gianforte and invite him to physically assault every member of  ’s news staff. It has always been the belief of this storied publication that elected officials and the press have important roles to play in our democracy: namely, that the former sets the policies that guide our nation, and the latter subserviently provides a mouthpiece to trumpet the will and intentions of the ruling class without question and without complaint. We here at   are fully aware that our own reporters, like all members of the power-mad, out-of-control media, frequently overstep these sacred boundaries by scrutinizing the decisions and actions that those in mighty seats of authority, such as Mr. Gianforte, do not wish to discuss. And in such instances, it is important—imperative, even—that those who hold the reins of power put us in our place and punish us, preferably with considerable physical force, so that we never again commit such improper transgressions. If any of our journalists have ever made Mr. Gianforte feel threatened in any way at all, whether by holding a recorder too close to his face, writing a story that did not paint him in a positive light, or disrespectfully seeking clarification on a point he or his party might have made, we encourage him to use his fists, knees, elbows, or a blunt object of his choice to make it known through repeated physical blows how we have upset him. To demonstrate our publication’s commitment to the solemn mission of maintaining the press’s proper subservience to the privileged and powerful, we invite—indeed, we encourage—Mr. Gianforte to visit  ’s headquarters at his convenience. Upon entering our offices, he will promptly be directed to the rows of desks where our editorial staff produce their reportage so that he may assault each and every one of us for as long as he deems necessary. Furthermore,   would like to make it clear to Mr. Gianforte—as well as all other politicians who serve at all levels of government—that if at any time in the future you are ever asked a question by a member of our staff that you find unfair, intrusive, disparaging, or that simply makes you feel uncomfortable, please immediately channel all of your strength into shoving this individual out of your presence, preferably knocking them to the ground or against the wall, so that they may understand their error. And if one of our reporters ever attempts to record an interaction that you do not wish to have documented,   kindly suggests that you grab the camera or tape recorder from the journalist’s hands and throw it back into their chest or against a nearby wall as vigorously as you are capable of. To further clarify just how he may treat our journalists, we ask that Mr. Gianforte refer to the following list of attacks that we have approved for his use, either individually or in combination, against any member of  staff: Slap Kick Punch to face Punch to abdomen Punch to back of head Throw to ground Chokehold Hit with heavy object Throat stomp Grab by hair and smash face into tabletop Suplex While not a physically injurious attack, it should be noted that Mr. Gianforte is additionally allowed to spit on us.  believes strongly in the deferential role that the press must play in American democracy, and last night’s event in Montana was just the latest positive episode in the elegant dance between journalism and power that has gone on since this country’s founding. Without the vigilance and threats of physical violence from brave men and women like Mr. Gianforte, the press would surely become too brazen and powerful. Mr. Gianforte, we hope that you accept our apology on behalf of the disgusting, disrespectful   journalist who asked you that reprehensible question yesterday, and please know that we have readied a selection of heavy wooden bats for your use here in our offices and we eagerly await your reply.

"The Onion While Donald Trump has courted the media spotlight for more than four decades, his wife and children have maintained notably lower profiles. And although  ’s legion of journalists embedded deep inside the luxury neckwear industry have attempted to gain access to the Trump family for years, none of these efforts have provided as much insight into the private lives of these captivating individuals as have the emails, letters, and other materials contained within the trove of White House documents this publication has obtained. Now, at last,   can reveal the driving passions, the inner struggles, and the spiraling death counts lurking behind the glossy exterior of one of America’s most prosperous and powerful families. Of all of the Trump children, Ivanka maintains the closest ties to the commander in chief, given her role as an assistant to the president and her marriage to White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner. In fact, she seems to look after the president with an almost maternal level of care, having developed a comprehensive set of  , which she has shared with White House staffers. She also appears to be the most strong-willed and independent-minded of the young Trumps, as she revealed at the   on April 6, when she stubbornly refused the night’s specially prepared meal, explaining that she was “on a strict aroma-based diet and [would] provide her own lavender, sage, and sandalwood-infused handkerchiefs.” However, numerous conflict-of-interest concerns continue to swirl around the 35-year-old, as she has maintained a managerial position in her fashion line while in office, a fact that was clearly demonstrated in a series of  , who informed her of several fatal workplace accidents that were delaying the production of her label’s latest design. Ivanka’s brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, assumed control of the family business upon their father’s inauguration, with both currently serving in executive positions at the Trump Organization. However, according to documents obtained by  , it is clear that the pair have maintained persistent contact with their father since he took office, as indicated, for example, by the   for February 10, which revealed that Eric signed in that day to “play in the White House pool.” And while the president had promised to separate himself from the dealings of his namesake business, there exist a significant number of emails in which the two Trump sons are clearly seen  , such as the sketches they made of a flying go-kart and a “robot karate master,” as well as a script for a film called “Dooms Day Mision [sic]” that they described as “an action movie about 2 business guys who fight robbers at night and ther [sic] dad is the president of the United States!!!” In contrast to the relatively abundant information regarding her older half-siblings, there is little in  ’s collection of White House documents that pertains to, or even mentions, Tiffany Trump, the president’s only child from his marriage to Marla Maples. According to the few scant pieces of evidence in our files, Tiffany is mostly kept at a distance from President Trump, as indicated by her February visit to the White House for her   It also appears that she is financially removed from the rest of her family, based on a   for stewardship of the “Trump Family (all but Tiffany) Trust.” Perhaps even more dispiriting than the circumstances surrounding Tiffany are those in which the first lady finds herself. In her numerous  , Melania speaks of a suffocating cloak of sadness enveloping her and a biting distaste for most of the workers in her husband’s employ, from Stephen Miller and his degenerate lusting after her shoes, to Kellyanne Conway’s constant “hissing” and “skulking,” to the “rancid scent” that follows Steve Bannon “like a putrid ghoul.” By her own admission, Melania is only able to experience a measure of happiness in the company of her chambermaid Annalise, whom she has grown quite fond of “despite her lowly social station and frightfully plain countenance.” While the documents acquired by   shed considerable light on the little-known members of the first family, our understanding of these enigmatic individuals remains far from complete. Indeed, these documents have raised a considerable number of urgent questions. Do enough of Ivanka’s garment factory workers remain alive to complete her fall collection?

" The Onion  Who is Donald Trump truly? What are the private thoughts he contemplates? And how will his presidency reshape America? As  ’s 300,000 staffers in its news bureaus and manual labor camps around the world continue to pore through the immense trove of documents obtained from an anonymous White House source, the answers that are emerging to these questions are deeply unnerving and suggest grave outcomes for the American people, the current international order,  ,  , and most devastatingly, the nation’s  . The evidence of improper—if not outright criminal—behavior is ample, from a damning   sent directly to President Trump from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, to a revealing   charging the president $111.90 for a “replacement gas valve for [his] evidence furnace,” to a   with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The abuse of the nation’s highest office appears to be rampant and ongoing. However, beyond the headline-grabbing scandals of Russian collusion, tax evasion, and conflicts of interest, what these documents reveal, above all else, is that there is something haunting President Trump. Throughout these pages, there is substantial proof that Trump is afflicted with some severe emotional disorder, given that he   and calls out the name “Frederick” whenever he sleeps, that he   because its layout was too painfully reminiscent of the supple curves of Marla Maples, and that he has his aides lay him down on the Oval Office couch each evening and   in a calm and steady tone of voice to soothe his destructive impulses. Indeed, the president’s behavioral problems have become such a problem that his staffers have   from ever being shown in the West Wing, as the accents on the BBC and the fast-moving graphics on the Weather Channel tend to induce his spastic outbursts. But what is it exactly that haunts Donald Trump? Most notably, the president appears preoccupied with the question of his rightful claim to the presidency. In the days immediately following his inauguration, Trump signed a series of   designating himself as the legitimate and undisputed 45th president of the United States, legally requiring that he “be held in the same regard as all former U.S. presidents, including: I. Abraham Lincoln II. Ronald Reagan III. Barack Obama.” In addition, despite receiving a   from President Obama on his first day in office, Trump seems determined to undo his predecessor’s signature accomplishments, as evidenced by the secret executive order he issued on February 26 titled  Moreover, Trump perceives anyone who disagrees with him as an enemy to be vanquished, a tendency most clearly on display in the   for yawning in his presence and talking over his favorite Planters Peanuts commercial, as well as the   for “the vindictive and unwarranted character assassination” he has suffered from publications that owe their existence to the invention of the printing press and movable type. The president’s deep personal paranoia is also being channeled through the agencies he controls, as revealed in a   that warned the president the   in Wyoming was determined to release a highly damaging blog post about the administration and outlined strategies for eliminating the newspaper with military force. What’s abundantly clear in these documents is that the president thinks almost exclusively of himself and his own personal desires, paying little attention to others, even his own family members, as evidenced by an   between him and White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway regarding Trump’s youngest son. He is obsessed with the material trappings of his job, demanding that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg make  , including the installation of marble fixtures, marble seats, and marble engines on the aircraft, and later issuing an   declaring that all of his favorite objects in the White House once belonged to President Lincoln, from the Resolute Desk, to the china collection, to Harry Truman’s “The buck stops here” plaque, to the White House bowling alley. As the most powerful officeholder on the planet, Trump’s egoism, dark paranoia, and quickness to cast blame are particularly disquieting. In just his first few weeks in office, he enacted   for purposes that remain disturbingly opaque, such as the order he issued on February 15  , or the one he issued just two days later enacting a mysterious program known only as the  . Perhaps most disturbingly, though, the president and his team have developed a   that allows them to quickly and easily crack down on whichever racial, religious, or ethnic group they please simply by inserting a handful of details into the text—a “fear-inducing noun” here and “an adjective that implies ‘subhuman’ without explicitly stating it” there—and in so doing, immediately curtailing the rights of large swaths of the populace. As Americans, we hope that our president approaches the momentous challenges of the job with a resolute, measured, and humane mind-set. However, the documents that have been tirelessly examined and reexamined by  ’s most highly skilled child laborers reveal that the occupant of the highest seat in our country spends more time   than paying attention in budget meetings and has considerable trouble completing   in his daily intelligence briefings. So what can be said about President Trump and the imprint he will leave on this country? Perhaps the only definitive pronouncement to be made is that, should his next four years follow the pattern of his first four months, citizens should prepare themselves for a stark erosion of America’s bedrock ideals and  .

"The Onion As soon as Donald Trump won the presidency last November, it became clear to every editor, journalist, and indentured Laotian typesetter at   that we would soon be contending with an unorthodox administration. Now, as our employees ceaselessly analyze a vast trove of classified White House documents on ocean barges floating outside the jurisdiction of the Fair Labor Standards Act, we are finding ample evidence that the path being pursued by this president and his cabinet is, as anticipated, startlingly unlike any other in history. In fact, every American should cower in fear at what we have uncovered. While it is evident to even a casual political observer that the Trump administration is determined to reverse numerous Obama-era norms and regulations, the precise details of such efforts are particularly shocking. Notably, we have obtained evidence that the Department of Homeland Security is moving to   for suspected terrorists, illegal immigrants, and the White House Press Corps. According to the highly classified material in our possession, the federal government plans to circumvent the Geneva Conventions by detaining these individuals within a timeless, lightless extra-dimensional realm known as The Void, where prisoners can be deprived of sleep for up to 40,000 years at a time and forced to watch their families grow old and die across billions of alternate universes. The new administration is also poised to discontinue Obama-era green energy initiatives and return the nation to a greater reliance on fossil fuels, which could have dire implications for every citizen of this nation. Specifically, Energy Secretary Rick Perry delivered a   in April addressing the nation’s energy crisis, noting forebodingly that “human bodies are made of carbon which can become oil” and that “there are over 320 million sources of oil in the U.S. today.” At present, it appears the Energy Department is piloting a “carceral production plan” to tap this new source of fuel as soon as possible. The ecosystem also appears to be at serious risk under this cabinet, based on the presentation that Administrator Scott Pruitt delivered to the president in March outlining the   for the next four years. Furthermore, Pruitt himself confirmed he is actively subverting his own agency’s efforts to protect the environment in a   regarding the progress he was making in destroying his office with a hammer. It should be noted that the decisions now being made in Washington are not only placing the future of the planet in peril, but also the future of our nation’s children. According to  ’s analysis, the only effort Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has so far made to bolster the public school curriculum was her recommendation to instate a nationwide  , which she claimed would “instill important skills like leadership and field etiquette into these kids that they will need later in life.” Additionally, the sole memo she has thus far issued in office was titled   which decried the negative learning conditions that result when children encounter a variety of hand-drawn dongs—from large dongs, to curved dongs, to dongs with excessive curly black hair—throughout the pages of their course books. While DeVos’ initiatives raise serious and troubling questions, perhaps no cabinet member’s behavior is more perplexing than that of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. According to a   delivered in February, Carson warned the Oval Office that his agency was unable to “translate the language spoken by ranch houses,” that skyscrapers “have threatened to get even taller,” and that some vague but menacing figure known as “Grathshashon” had “returned.” Carson’s bizarre beliefs were no further clarified in a  , in which he attempted to persuade his fellow cabinet member to sign a treaty bringing an end to the “senseless war between houses and cars.” Even more puzzling, though, was a series of urgent emails that Carson sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on February 28 in which he stated that he had become   and could not find his way out. Such peculiar and unsettling behavior appears to be pervasive throughout the president’s cabinet. The Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, compiled a   for the president to look over, which included such options as conscripting all citizens into the military and raising the price of specialist visits to $158,000 apiece. Moreover, the nation’s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, signaled a sharp turn from the diplomacy pursued under the Obama administration by issuing a memo laying out an  , ranging from “working to restore American-sponsored coups to pre-1990 levels” to having the United States create a “new catastrophic power vacuum somewhere else in [the] world to take pressure off [the] Middle East.” Additional documents showed that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tried to personally redesign U.S. currency as he saw fit. In an   that feature an image of Harriet Tubman, Mnuchin asked if there was “any way we can get someone like Dwight Eisenhower or General MacArthur on there instead?” and proceeded to list off dozens of other individuals, from James K. Polk to Milton Friedman, whom he considered more deserving of adorning U.S. money. Given the nation’s deepening concerns about the commander in chief’s impartiality and fitness to lead, it would be heartening to know that the individuals around him—the heads of the various executive departments who are charged with carrying out the many functions of the federal government—were making sound decisions in our nation’s best interest. However, the documents obtained by   cast serious doubt on this hopeful notion. What is certain is that each and every one of us will face dire challenges in the four years ahead, whether by entering a diminished health care or education system, being processed into oil, or succumbing to an   and begun swallowing our local communities whole.

"The Onion The editorial board of   continues to work around the clock forcing its cramped basement of illegal migrant laborers to sift through page after page of classified White House documents. And as more and more information is pieced together, one stark truth has emerged again and again: Each and every one of President Trump’s closest advisors and confidants is psychologically disturbed in some profound and perverse way. Let’s first turn to the peculiar fixations of Vice President Mike Pence, who appears uninterested in carrying out the prescribed functions of his office and more inclined to spend his time   for emphasizing the concept of love too frequently or   like “entangled” and “cloture,” which he considers too crass to be uttered in his company. Moreover, Pence seems to show little regard for the federal government’s time or money, having attempted to  , and using significant portions of the workday to browse his   or to sketch out his  . The only evidence   could find of the vice president actually engaging with his fellow politicians in Washington was a memo he authored  . Indeed, few officials are even able to meet with Pence, as he requires all individuals to fill out a   that includes such prompts as “Please list the dates of all your spiritual rebirths” and “Have you ever stood directly adjacent to another man’s wife?” before they are allowed to enter his residence or office. The most unsettling member of Trump’s inner circle, however, appears to be Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, whose documented actions, such as his request that the Interior Department send him pictures of its most   or this  , have caused a significant number of  ’s analysts to begin vomiting violently and fall into a shuddering, wide-eyed stupor, as if a plague of sorts had been transmitted to them simply by reading about Bannon’s behavior. Based on the documents that our team has been able to endure, it appears the chief strategist has caused considerable   in the West Wing, from dismembering rodents, to gnawing multiple times through sewage pipes. Moreover, in March, the White House Physician traced a   to Bannon’s office. It seems that Bannon is doing something odious and concerning at every moment of the day, whether it’s having   and   delivered to his office,  , or sending back   for being dead and cooked. However, what is most worrying about Bannon are his distinctly sinister ambitions, as evidenced in an extremely   he prepared for Donald Trump, or his apparent coaxing of the president into signing an ominous executive order titled   There is no telling what horrors Bannon would seek to enact if he were to gain further power. Whereas Bannon appears elusive, solitary, and tight-lipped, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway is revealed in these documents to be desperately in need of the public spotlight. Indeed, a   with Fox News demonstrates just how needy she is, as Conway made clear that she would “physically disappear from the visible spectrum if [she does] not appear on television every 24 hours.” Moreover, Conway seeks such frequent media attention that she receives a   with a color-coded key explaining how she should behave on camera, from acting “fiercely incredulous,” to “turn[ing the] conversation into an attack on immigrants,” to “accus[ing] Obama of whatever Trump is being accused of.” Privately, however, Conway appears to be more relaxed, indulging herself with a   In addition, a Craigslist ad she posted in March titled  reveals how she decompresses from the strains of the White House, describing herself as “a married white woman in her early 50s looking for a young man (18-24) who would be willing to let me beat the shit out of him for half an hour or so.” One of the most enigmatic figures in Trump’s inner circle is Senior Advisor Stephen Miller, who keeps a lower profile, and for understandable reason: his sexual perversions are particularly pronounced and distasteful. In an   sent to fellow West Wing staffers, Miller explained that he has been following a new woman around town, alludes to an activity he plans to engage in with the mannequins at Macy’s, and speaks of a rather large package he had delivered from a company called Pink Cherry Inflatables. Moreover, Mr. Miller apparently decided to  , telling the heads of the CIA and Defense Department that he has “reason to believe our enhanced interrogation tactics may be having the exact opposite effect on detainees than what is intended. Put simply, they feel great. Better than great, actually.” While the Oval Office may wish that Miller’s depraved desires could be kept under wraps, his perversions have not gone unnoticed by those outside the administration: a number of disgusted West Wing tour members have spoken of their   in voicemails left on the White House Visitor Center telephone line. In stark contrast to Pence, Bannon, Conway, and Miller, all of whom evidently pursue their own unique and bizarre pleasures in the White House, there is a figure in Trump’s orbit who appears to know only misery and suffering: Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Spicer seems to have no allies in the administration, as evidenced by a secret recording of two West Wing staffers discussing the  , who is heard in the background whimpering inside his punishment crate. Indeed, the trove of leaked documents confirm that Spicer is regularly disciplined and abused by the president, from being forced to  , to  . Spicer himself confirmed his sad plight in a series of candid and   to his only apparent friend and confidant, his Uncle Wilbur, with whom he shared his initial elation at being hired by Trump, his growing disillusionment with his job and the very nature of truth itself, and eventually his tragic and complete break with reality. Somewhat similar to Spicer, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appears to receive no discernible respect from either his boss or his peers as he, seemingly alone, carries out the necessary day-to-day operations of the Trump White House. According to the documents, Priebus compiled all the candidates, including Neil Gorsuch, Antonin Scalia Jr., and Judge Doom, for the  ; performed all the legwork of  ; and helped HUD Secretary Ben Carson when he became  . However, based on the evidence available to  , the only appreciation Priebus has ever received in return for his efforts was an extensive amount of  . And finally, there’s Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, who appears as if he is earnestly attempting to assist the administration, having devised, for example,  , ranging from “Israel gets Jerusalem, but Palestine gets it on weekends and holidays” to “Faster internet (both sides).” However, not much more can be gleaned about this obscure figure, as he is  , such as the East Asia Summit, the White House Easter Egg Roll, and the National Cherry Blossom Festival, due to his significant investments in them and the considerable sums of money he stands to make from their proceedings. As the nation rollicks and careens about amid a fantastic political storm, it is more important than ever to know who is steering our course. Unfortunately, the portraits that are emerging of the seldom seen and poorly known individuals in Trump’s inner circle are far from reassuring. According to the official documents penned by these very individuals, the fate of the most powerful nation the world has ever known now rests in the hands of a disconcerting assortment of freaks, failures, accursed abominations of nature, and straight-up perverts, any and all of whom may be profiting handsomely off of whatever you happen to be doing at any given moment.

"WASHINGTON—Commemorating what is widely considered to be the greatest achievement of space exploration, NASA on Tuesday celebrated the 60th anniversary of the launching of the first moon to orbit Earth. “We may not consider the idea of a moon that orbits Earth to be that big of a deal today, but if you mentioned it just a few decades ago, people would think you were crazy,” said NASA acting administrator Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., explaining that with the successful launch of the 7.36 x 1022 kg satellite into orbit, the United States effectively won the space race precipitated in the 1950s by the Soviet Union’s launching of the first meteor. “It wasn’t an easy journey—one of the models exploded on the launch pad and another burned up while it was exiting the atmosphere. But thanks to key technological developments such as the three-stage super heavy-lift launch vehicle and the innovative computer systems on board, we proved that no goal, no matter how impossible it might seem, is unattainable.” Lightfoot went on to say that further advances would allow NASA to launch a second moon by 2040 and then another moon approximately every 10 years after that.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the long-overdue gesture was a step towards atoning for the space agency’s past transgressions, NASA issued a formal apology Wednesday for the 1969 genocide of the moon’s native population. “The time has come to recognize NASA’s detestable role in the massacre of the moon’s original inhabitants,” said NASA spokesperson Natalie Warheit, adding that the blood of countless indigenous moon natives would forever be on the organization’s hands. “When we first set foot upon the moon, we found a thriving and peaceful civilization that welcomed our astronauts as friends and even worshipped Neil Armstrong as a god. Shamefully, we exploited their trust by slaughtering thousands, indirectly killing even more by exposing them to Earth diseases against which they had no defense, and then burying them all in mass graves by the Mare Serenitatis basin. NASA apologizes unequivocally for these atrocities.” At press time, NASA had also issued an apology for its role in toppling the democratic government of Neptune during the Voyager 2 mission.

"FAIRFIELD, ME―Having seen more students than she can remember come into her office with complaints of nausea and vomiting over the years, Fairfield High School nurse Sarah Bromti told reporters Wednesday she’s getting to the point where she can identify morning sickness without much trouble. “I’ve been at this for a while now, so when a freshman or sophomore walks in during first period with that look on her face, I have a pretty good idea what’s going on,” said Bromti, noting that most of the time, she’s already pulled a teen pregnancy pamphlet out of her desk drawer before the student has even started listing her symptoms. “You see enough queasy ones and eventually you can just pick out which aren’t the flu or food poisoning. If a girl comes in here a month or two after the annual ski trip, that’s what it is nine times out of 10.” At press time, Bromti had cut her time with reporters short because a pale-looking 15-year-old cheerleader was approaching her desk.

"HOMESTEAD, FL—Acting on a tip from a local fisherman who caught the former vice president siphoning gas from his outboard motor, DNC Chairman Tom Perez on Monday reportedly tracked down   deep in the Florida Everglades tossing whole raw chickens to alligators. Sources confirmed that the bearded, shaggy-haired Biden, who withdrew from public life four months ago, was initially startled to see Perez, dropping the bird carcass he was de-feathering and uttering “ah shit” when he recognized the newly elected head of the Democratic Party. “How the fuck did you guys find me?” said Biden, flicking a lit cigarette into the swamp before wiping his brow with the bottom of his faded Merit cigarettes tank top. “I was really hoping I’d seen my last   pencil pusher.” “Ain’t much I can do for you unless you want to see ’ol Betsy here make a 10-pound leghorn disappear,” added the former six-term Delaware senator, dangling a limp chicken over the snapping jaws of an adult female alligator. “These days I’m just trying to put together a gator show for the tourists and make some scratch, but since you hauled ass all the way down here, I guess you got Uncle Joe’s ear.” Biden reportedly encouraged Perez to “take a load off” on an overturned plastic bucket outside his decrepit wooden shack, popped off the cork of a rum bottle with his teeth, took a long swig, and described how he was finally living the good life. The former VP then waded knee-deep into the water and attempted to grab a catfish barehanded while explaining that he relished the chance to spend quiet time in nature “way the fuck away from the D.C. shit fiesta.” According to sources, the 74-year-old, who categorically refused Perez’s pleas to help the beleaguered Democratic Party campaign in a handful of local races, added that even a bad day in the swamp beat having to “waste a killer buzz sitting in some bullshit cabinet meeting” or “wank off the Joint Chiefs” like in his previous job. Biden then warned the DNC chairman to keep his eyes peeled, explaining that the alligators could get a “little feisty” once they got a few chickens in them. “Most of these guys are pretty chill, except for that big boy over there—watch out for the chompers on that fucker,” said Biden, gesturing with the severed tip of his right index finger toward a 9-foot-long male affectionately named Diablo. “He may have nipped my pleasure pointer, but he sure as shit got the business end of a broken Cuervo bottle.” “So let’s just say we’ve got an unspoken agreement,” Biden added. “Still got the fingertip floating around with some ice-cold brewhas in case I ever need that sucker.” While Biden admitted that more work needed to be done so that no American had to choose between affordable healthcare and Ozzfest tickets, he also reiterated his lack of interest in even a modest role in politics, and instead reportedly offered to take Perez for a spin in an old fan boat he’d recently restored in his downtime.  “My main man Rez, what do you think of my hot new fling?” said Biden, who accelerated the rickety boat through the brackish water and started “doing donuts” as Perez tightly gripped both sides of his seat and tried not to get mud on his clothes. “If I really gun her, we can catch some serious fuckin’ air.” “Dammit, I think I just clipped a manatee,” Biden continued. “Better slow this puppy down or the dicks from Fish and Wildlife will be up my ass again.” Easing back on the boat’s throttle, Biden reportedly invited the DNC chairman to help himself to a Slim Jim and a couple of Coors tallboys from a cooler in the stern. “I’m not gonna lie, I’ve got a good thing going here in the Glades,” said Biden, turning up BulletBoys’ “Smooth Up In Ya” on a beat-up boombox covered in marijuana leaf and Graffix bong stickers. “The sun’s bright, and the babes ain’t got any damn tan-lines. Plus, I don’t have to worry about narcs like you telling me what I can and can’t say.” “Listen, for the first time in my life, I’ve got my shit together, so I’m staying put,” Biden continued. “Next time you’re in D.C., give my best to Jilly. Just don’t mention where I am or your ass is fucking grass.” ",1,DNC Chair Tracks Down Biden In Everglades Tossing Whole Chickens To Gators
"ARLINGTON, VA—Explaining that readership of science-related articles and discussion of scientific concepts tends to surge at such times, a report released Thursday by the National Science Foundation confirmed that Americans are most interested in science when the moon looks different than normal. “According to our findings, citizens are never more engaged by scientific disciplines than when the moon does not look like it regularly does—for example, when it becomes big or bright,” read the report in part, which added that while the nation’s interest in science is typically fairly minimal and consistent when the moon is its usual size and color, as soon as these properties of the moon differ in a noticeable way, millions of Americans begin displaying a desire to learn and share scientific knowledge. “The moon is ordinarily white and relatively small, and science is not on most people’s minds. However, when the moon is no longer white and small, and instead happens to be large, reddish, temporarily darkened, or any combination of those things, people generally want to know more about the methodological study of natural phenomena. Of course, once the moon goes back to the way it normally looks, interest in how the universe works drops back to baseline levels.” The report went on to mention that major changes to the Earth appeared not to garner Americans’ interest at all.

"WASHINGTON—Preparing for a surge in business from the millions of Americans who could soon be left without access to medical care, the nation’s back alleys were reportedly rushing to expand their services Thursday in anticipation of the American Health Care Act becoming law. Sources from back alleys in every state confirmed that as soon as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill known as Trumpcare, their filth-strewn, sidestreet-based facilities began scrambling to add personnel and expand into nearby shuttered warehouses and vacant lots in order to meet the increased demand for services expected from low-income families, elderly Americans, individuals with pre-existing conditions, and others who will have decreased access to health coverage. “We’re gonna have thousands of people coming through here soon, and right now we’re just not ready for them,” said Durham, NC man Curtis Hendershaw, who spoke from a narrow alleyway behind the Dragon Inn Chinese restaurant, adding that he had already begun making calls to all the unlicensed physicians and disgraced former medical professionals he knows. “We’re used to stitching a guy up here and there, but as soon as insurers can drop essential benefits and impose annual payment caps, we’ll be doing all sorts of major surgeries, pediatric services, mental health treatment, you name it.” “I just put some cardboard down under that fire escape there so we can have a dry place for a neonatal unit,” he continued.  According to reports, back alleys around the country have begun to upgrade their facilities, hauling in additional soiled twin mattresses to increase the number of available beds, shoveling out rodent carcasses to create makeshift waiting areas, and diverting drainpipes from adjacent buildings so amateur practitioners have a supply of rusty water to scrub their hands with before performing appendectomies. The demand is expected to be so great that the back alleys are reportedly planning to offer a wide array of medical services, with each darkened, grimy corner of the nation’s empty back streets and abandoned industrial parks focusing on specialized areas, such as emergency care, geriatrics, labor and delivery, prescription drug dispensing, or outpatient amputation procedures. “This is a huge change for us, because we’ve been scaling back for the past six or seven years, and now all of a sudden we have to undergo a major expansion so we can meet the needs of a large section of the community,” said Don Chalmers, 51, who works in a back alley behind a parking garage several blocks from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “We’ve lost a lot of business to that hospital up the street, but with this new bill cutting Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars and eliminating the employer mandate, a lot of people will be walking right out those doors and right into the ICU we’re setting up in the back of this old burnt-out van over here.” “It’s not that bad, though, really,” he continued. “As soon as your procedure’s finished we lay you down under a bridge where you’re welcome to rest up as long as you need to.” Chalmers went on to state that he had even further expansion plans for the future, gesturing toward a nearby dumpster, which he said he was hoping to set up as a hospice unit. Additionally, he said he had found a dental assistant with access to oral painkillers who told him she could help out with addicts who, if the 2010 Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced, will no longer be able to afford methadone or addiction treatment.  Speaking with reporters, several Americans who stand to lose their health insurance under Trumpcare expressed their gratitude that the nation’s back alleys were expanding to meet their needs. “I have three young children, so it’s good to know that a place like this is here, just off of Cottman Avenue, beyond all the truck loading docks,” 41-year-old Laura Williams said as she watched a broken leg being reset in an alley behind a Northeast Philadelphia check-cashing facility. “This is great news for my mom, too, who’s starting to get on in years. It’s not that convenient; I had to take three buses to get here and then climb through a hole in a chain-link fence. But at least it’s something my family can afford.” “Considering how busy these places are about to get, I just hope they’ll be able to fit us in,” Williams added.

"DALLAS—In order to assess the viability of the route for potential travel by human beings, Greyhound officials announced at a press conference Wednesday a mission that will send a pair of chimpanzees on a pioneering 457-mile overland bus trip from Buffalo, NY to Atlantic City, NJ. Greyhound researchers said that the adult chimps—named Kip and Dottie—would depart at 6 a.m. from the Metro Transportation Center in downtown Buffalo and, with luck, arrive seven hours and 20 minutes later at the Atlantic City bus terminal, an unprecedented journey that will reportedly push the animals to their physical and mental limits. “For years, we’ve dreamed of putting this extraordinary voyage within the reach of humans, and soon we will be one step closer to making that dream a reality,” said Greyhound spokesperson Andrea Gipson, explaining that data gathered from the mission will be invaluable in terms of developing the techniques and technologies an eventual human crew will require. “We’re still years away from mankind being able to endure a trip of this nature, but, if successful, what we learn from this undertaking will be crucial in opening up a bold new era of travel.” “It’s remarkable to contemplate,” added Gipson. “Even sending animals on a trip like this was once unthinkable.” Gipson went on to say that during their mission, Kip and Dottie would face challenges including extreme discomfort and lengthy periods of boredom occasionally interrupted by moments of acute aggravation, not to mention frequent car sickness brought on by the harrowing interstate trek. Throughout their trip, their mobility will reportedly be extremely hampered by seats that recline just an eighth of an inch and that will force the chimps to get what little sleep they can in a nearly vertical position. “We will monitor Kip and Dottie’s vital signs closely to see how the harsh conditions of the journey through the bleakest reaches of Western New York and upstate Pennsylvania affect their well-being,” Gipson said. “As our nearest biological relatives, chimps are the ideal test subjects to gauge how our own species might react when exposed to exceptionally stressful conditions such as the constant smell of warm egg salad or a flat tire occurring just 20 minutes into the trip.” Greyhound’s ground team in Dallas will reportedly observe the effects the journey will have on the chimpanzees by equipping them with a handful of scratch-off lottery tickets in order to monitor the possible degradation of the animals’ visual acuity and hand-eye coordination. Sources told reporters that the chimps will also be provided with one large bag of circus peanuts apiece to analyze changes in critical thinking as measured by how effectively they ration the treats until the bus reaches the refueling station at the halfway point—a Roy Rogers in New York’s Southern Tier region. According to researchers, the chimps will be outfitted in a standard uniform of sweatpants and flip-flops, with the addition of special sensors to record the the body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure of the animals as they are exposed to temperature extremes from sitting for hours in constant sunlight streaming through unshaded windows and being blasted by frigid air from broken air-conditioning vents directly overhead. “Kip and Dottie have undergone months of exhaustive training so that their reflexes are in peak condition to contend with floors that are simultaneously sticky and slick with spilled 7-Up,” Gipson said, referring to one of the unique phenomena that occur on such journeys and nowhere else known to science. “But as much as we can do to prepare them for this trip, there are still many, many unknowns. Will they be able to mentally withstand a flickering overhead TV screen, the volume of which will for no reason get higher and lower at random intervals? And while we’ve prepared for at least one extended highway breakdown, what about significant delays? How will the animals cope with a toilet that backs up 20 miles into the trip?” Continued Gipson, “The reality of the situation is, once the bus hits the I-476 ramp, the chimps are very much on their own.” Greyhound’s methodology has come under scrutiny in the past, most notably after 1999’s New York-to-D.C. disaster, in which a dog named Chief was killed when his 55-seat vehicle skidded into a wall of the Lincoln Tunnel just 17 minutes after departure. Nevertheless, officials remained optimistic that this latest research mission would yield results that would bring humanity ever closer to Western New York/coastal New Jersey bus travel. “We envision a future in which any person can purchase a low-cost bus ticket and be gambling their life’s savings away within just a half-day’s travel,” Gipson said. “And believe it or not, we’re even confident that one day, a dental receptionist from Cheektowaga will be able to attend a rowdy, drunken bachelorette party and already be on her way home within 24 hours, filled with intense shame and regret, and periodically vomiting into a plastic bag she acquired at a souvenir shop on the Atlantic City boardwalk—and Kip and Dottie will have no small part in that momentous achievement.” “Unfortunately for them, there’s only enough fuel in the tank for a one-way trip,” Gipson added.

"EARTH—Noting that the species’ tenure in the leadership role has been marked by an incompetence and shortsightedness that has caused irreparable damage, sources reported Thursday that humans are facing increased calls to give up their position as head of the world’s failing ecosystem. The critics clamoring for   to step down argue that as leader of the earth’s environment they have been responsible for one disaster after another, while over the past several decades the global ecological organization has essentially stopped functioning due to humanity’s gross mismanagement. “Since taking control of the ecosystem, human beings have misallocated its resources and left many of its operations teetering on the brink of collapse,” said Tracy Eldridge, a spokesperson for organisms demanding a change in leadership, noting that humans have overseen massive cuts in species around the world and that thousands more are expected to be eliminated within the next year alone. “Such wastefulness has threatened the long-term viability of the planet’s habitat, but humans appear unable to formulate an actionable plan to keep it running smoothly.” “If they stay in charge and continue making all the major strategic decisions for this ecosystem, I don’t see how it can last more than another few years,” she added. According to public records, humans have failed to implement quality control procedures for their water supply or meet annual targets for carbon reduction, and it was under their stewardship that the earth broke its impressive string of 180 million consecutive quarters of gains in biodiversity. Eldridge stated that ecosystem stakeholders have given humanity plenty of time to overcome early missteps like deforestation, but it has repeatedly failed to recognize its strategic mistakes and find ways to maintain a functioning environment. Other species have observed that before humans took over, the global ecosystem had been a model organization, with complex groups of highly successful biomes working together productively. However, after   assumed control, the ecosystem reportedly saw a decline in its overall capacity to host life that has only accelerated in recent decades, as multiple habitat divisions have faltered and nearly gone under. “Our traditional generators of biodiversity—rainforests, wetlands, coral reefs—have been scaled back dramatically by humans and have seen their productivity plummet as a result,” said Eldridge, who added that critical ecological initiatives such as pollination have also seen steep declines in their output. “The world habitat had been running a huge surplus on fresh water and ozone before humans, but after years of neglect and little to no investment from management, those strategic assets are severely depleted.” She continued, “The way things look right now, they might have to shut down the Arctic division completely.” Sources confirmed that species retention has fallen to an all-time low under humanity’s tenure, with many long-serving members of the ecosystem like the Western black rhinoceros, the auroch, the Caspian tiger, and the passenger pigeon leaving the planet completely. Those calling for removing humanity from its post claim the earth has far more qualified leaders currently waiting in the wings, species that are more favorably regarded throughout the ecosystem, have shown they can cooperate with other organisms, and have a proven track record of success dating back tens of millions of years. “There is a large contingent within the biosphere that would love to see ants take over after humans step down,” said Eldridge, who cited the insects’ tireless work ethic, longer tenure on the planet, and ability to work well in groups. “It has become very clear that humans will always place their own personal gain above the interests of their subordinate species and that they have little or no interest in the long-term prospects of their ecosystem.” “Every day the humans remain in charge, we are one day closer to the environment becoming a completely failed enterprise,” she continued. Eldridge added that if human beings do not voluntarily step down as head of the ecosystem, the environment might have to take drastic action to remove them forcibly.

"WATERBURY, CT—Reflecting wistfully on what he might have made of himself had he chosen a different profession, Dynatrend Solutions network engineer Alan Miller said Wednesday that he would be a systems manager if he had the chance to go back and do it all over again. Despite a long and successful career of identifying and solving network-infrastructure-based problems, the 47-year-old told reporters there will always be a little part of him that regrets not having instead followed his youthful ambition of designing technology solutions as a systems manager. “If I could tell my younger self one thing, it would be to go with your gut and take a shot with systems management, because if you don’t, you’re always going to wonder what might have been,” said Miller, who by his mid-20s had established himself as a network engineer, passing up the prospect of a more fun and rewarding career as a systems manager. “Who knows where life might have taken me if I hadn’t spent the past two decades devising, configuring, and supporting communications networks? What if, instead, I were managing, planning, and coordinating IT systems?” “I mean, I could be doing that right now,” he added. Although he acknowledged that trying to make it as a systems manager would have been a “more unorthodox choice” for him professionally, Miller also stressed that throughout his many years in network engineering he had often daydreamed about what it would be like, just once in his life, to analyze project workflow and perform systems upkeep, or to have a workday in which his hours were filled with opportunities to brainstorm and implement ways to resolve end-user systems issues. Miller stated that when he chose to become a network engineer he was too young and inexperienced to grasp the full repercussions of turning his back on what he referred to as the “career of my dreams.” Although he realizes now how much he passed up when he decided against applying for jobs that would have allowed him to monitor server metrics, automate technology services, and measure business performance in real time, he confirmed that such understanding has only come with the benefit of wisdom and age. “Of course I sometimes fantasize about dropping everything and starting over again as a systems manager,” said Miller, nonetheless conceding that such a dramatic professional shift was surely a pipedream at this point in his life. “If I were 10 or even five years younger, I might give it a shot. After all, I already know how to ensure secure connectivity to protect sensitive systems data—I could do that part. I might not be able to perform systems troubleshooting right away, but I could learn. It’s too late now, though. I’m a network engineer, and that’s not going to change.” “And maybe it was inevitable,” continued Miller. “Maybe I just wasn’t cut out for the sort of crazy, fast-paced life of routinely performing systems maintenance upgrades in the first place.” Despite his continuing doubts about whether he made the right career choice, Miller noted that his accomplishments as a network engineer have given him “plenty to be proud of,” including a 23-year record of dependable tier 4 support and network disaster recovery, and a solid reputation for ensuring software installations always adhere to corporate licensing laws. Still, Miller said, he often finds himself thinking back to a joint project in 1998 when he briefly worked alongside Dynatrend’s systems management team to fix an overheated server farm, an exciting and rewarding experience in which he witnessed up close the life he might have lived had he simply been slightly bolder in his youth. “Maybe I’m romanticizing what it’s like to spend your days applying systems technologies to meet a company’s organizational goals,” said Miller, speculating that perhaps even systems managers occasionally wonder what it’s like to be a network engineer. “But whenever I hear my buddy in systems management mention how he just executed some new systems strategy that allowed a project to better adhere to its timeline, I can’t help but sigh and think, ‘That could have been me.’” “That really could have been me,” he added.

"LAS VEGAS—Cursing at security officers as he fought their efforts to escort him from the premises, a kicking, screaming Warren Buffett was reportedly dragged from Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino early Wednesday morning after losing his entire fortune playing roulette. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman, who sources said had been betting almost continuously and in progressively greater amounts since checking into the hotel approximately 12 hours earlier, reportedly squandered $78.7 billion in stocks, bonds, real estate, and liquid assets by the time guards arrived to remove him. “It was hard watching him blow all his money like that, just sitting there putting down these giant stacks of chips even as he was getting deeper into the hole,” said casino patron Dwayne Mitchum, adding that Buffett initially seemed upbeat—drinking comped rum-and-cokes and casually dispensing free mutual-fund advice to other players—before his mood began darkening as he gambled away more and more of his wealth. “Then when he lost his very last $3.5 billion, you could almost see the blood draining from his face. He kind of froze for a second, like he was in some kind of trance.” “That’s when he slumped against the table and just started sobbing,” Mitchum added. According to sources, the 86-year-old business magnate frequently attempted to borrow money over the course of his gambling binge once he had exhausted his own personal resources. While Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger declined to lend him $40 billion despite Buffett’s promise he’d have it “back and then some” in an hour, Buffett was eventually able to have $5 billion wired to him by several of the company’s senior board members, whose concerns were reportedly allayed by assurances that he was “good for it.” “For a little while, at least, he was riding a really hot hand—I remember around midnight he won four or five $2 billion bets in a row,” croupier Molly Giorgi told reporters, noting that at one point the so-called Oracle of Omaha had attracted the attention of two young women who stood on either side and cheered him on as he collected his winnings. “But then he started wagering $6 billion here, $10 billion there, and pretty soon he was down to just a few billion, which was all the money he had left in the world.” “When he pushed those last chips toward me, I asked him if he was sure, and he just loosened his tie, smoothed back his hair, and said, ‘Shut up and put it on 22,’” she continued, recalling that the room went silent as the ball skittered around before finally landing on 19. “Once he saw he’d lost, he just snapped, wailing about how he was on the hook for billions to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and that he didn’t know what they’d do when they found out he was now completely broke.” Witnesses confirmed that as security personnel approached, a disheveled, perspiring Buffett launched into a stream of verbal attacks directed at casino employees, whom he accused of either rigging the wheel or using an “illegal ball.” Buffett reportedly then made a sudden break toward the slot machine area, where he snatched several patrons’ cups of quarters before tripping over his own feet and stumbling into a cocktail waitress. Quickly pinned to the floor by guards, he was then whisked out a side door, frantically screaming for help because “those casino crooks took all my money.” “I felt bad seeing him take the loss so poorly, but then again I was standing near him when he hit a $10 billion column bet and tucked 2.8 [billion] into my shirt pocket for being his ‘lucky charm,’” said Phoenix-area visitor and now 239th richest person in America, Bob Raskow. “But that’s Vegas for you—it doesn’t matter if you run the fourth-largest public company on the planet, the house always wins.” At press time, a trembling Buffett was seen sitting on the curb outside Caesars Palace with his head in his hands, repeatedly dialing his wife’s number and hanging up as soon as he heard her voice.

"DRAGON’S KEEP—Admitting that the troves of valuable items scattered everywhere made it difficult for him to put food on the table, video game blacksmith Torg Nailbender was reportedly struggling Monday to compete with all the random chests full of free armor all over the kingdom. “It’s hard to make a buck when all any potential customer has to do is wander through the woods or a nearby dungeon and pick up a bunch of armaments totally gratis,” said Nailbender, noting that the swords, shields, and crossbows were readily available and frequently more powerful than the ones he could provide. “It’s not fair that I have to slave away for hours to construct a dagger or two, but any jerk can just stumble into a whole set of scimitars brimming with enchantments. The market is completely saturated. And that doesn’t even begin to account for the fact that there’s another blacksmith just like me in every adjacent town so my entire clientele consists of people who just happen to be passing through.” Nailbender added that his economic burden was further exacerbated by customers already flush with treasure coming to his smithery and forcing him to buy their weapons for fifty gold pieces each.

"COLUMBIA, MD—In a purely self-interested move that is certain to set the tone for the next 18 years, sources confirmed Wednesday that local woman Rebecca McBride is already off to a bad start as a mother after requesting an epidural during the delivery of her first child. According to accounts, McBride took the easy way out by asking doctors to administer a pain reliever minutes before going into active labor with her son, proving that she simply isn’t cut out for the challenges of motherhood. Reports indicate that the weak-willed McBride, who could have started her maternal years on the right foot by putting in the effort necessary to withstand the physical discomfort, instead dropped the ball during her very first moments as a parent by taking anesthesia that would render her completely detached from her child’s entry into the world. Sources then expressed their deepest sympathies for McBride’s newborn son, Joshua, after his negligent mother sat around doing nothing and had to rely on someone else to clear her baby’s blocked airway rather than take care of her child’s problem herself.

"LONDON—Adding to the already long list of grievances they had with their guest, officials at the Ecuadorian embassy reported Thursday that they were beginning to get really sick of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange always leaving his dirty dishes around the premises. Sources said that Assange, whose presence has reportedly grown more and more disruptive since his arrival in 2012, has a habit of abandoning sauce-covered plates in random consular offices throughout the building. In addition, officials complained that Assange often blasts loud techno music during important calls with Quito, makes awkward conversation with visitors applying for visas, and loafs around conference rooms in his ratty, stained briefs while diplomats attempt to conduct meetings. “Pretty much every day, I come into the kitchen and he’s burned a bunch of eggs on the pan, which he then just leaves on the stove,” said Ecuadorian ambassador Juan Falconí Puig, adding that while Assange typically lets weeks’ worth of bowls filled with milk residue and cereal-encrusted spoons pile up in the sink, they have also been discovered on windowsills, in the hallway outside his door, and, on one occasion, on top of a toilet tank. “He also leaves his takeout containers lying around everywhere, including the reception area, so people just get smacked by the odor of curry the minute they walk in.” “And I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to pull clumps of stringy white hair out of the shower,” added Puig. “It’s, like, come on Julian. Other people use that shower too.” Puig told reporters that staff members have confronted the 45-year-old multiple times about his behavior, but with little success. On issues ranging from eating other people’s food to leaving dirty socks strewn on the embassy’s main staircase to never in almost five years replacing the toilet paper, Puig said that Assange usually makes a big show of improving for a few days but then goes right back to his old habits. Sources confirmed that frustrated Ecuadorian officials have resorted to leaving harshly worded notes for Assange, but—as was the case with messages insisting Assange not to use the microwave to cook fish and not to drape wet towels on the backs of antique leather armchairs—the strategy has had no apparent effect. “Yesterday I was having a meeting with the Scottish Secretary of State, and Julian wanders into the conference room, props his bare feet up on the table, and just starts cutting his toenails,” said Puig, noting that he had to stop himself from gagging when a small yellowed clipping nearly hit the rim of his water glass. “Fine, we’re all sharing the same space, but at least put on a shirt if you’re going to walk right through a negotiation session with the leaders of our host nation, you know?” “Maybe then we wouldn’t mind as much when he opens a brand new jar of peanut butter and then immediately loses the lid,” continued Puig. According to Puig, staff members have gently tried hinting that Assange should find a new place to live by pointing out how many other nice embassies there are around town, recently going so far as to slip in a link to the Belgian embassy at the bottom of an internal email about promoting Galapagos tourism. But officials told reporters that Assange may in fact be growing even more comfortable in his current surroundings, judging by the purchase of a large bookcase he was heard hammering together during a banquet for dignitaries from five other South American nations. “It would be one thing if it was just him, but he’s got these weird friends who come around at all hours,” said Puig, referring to the nameless group of associates who typically show up after midnight, remain silent even when greeted, and always keep their faces covered with black bandanas. “It’s ridiculous—for some reason they insist on just hanging out here.” “Not to mention how slow the internet gets when they’re using it,” added Puig. “God knows what they’re all doing up there.” ",1,Ecuadorian Officials Starting To Get Sick Of Julian Assange Always Leaving Dirty Dishes All Over Embassy

Gorsuch, who reportedly changes clothes in the Supreme Court locker room by clutching a towel to his waist and attempting to shimmy his briefs down his legs, said he feels nervous removing his robes when his fellow justices are present and is accustomed to far more privacy than what the court’s communal showers provide. “I wish there were stalls or even just a few curtains, because I’m really not comfortable stripping down around all these older justices that have been doing this forever,” said Gorsuch, who is typically the last of the court’s nine members to leave the bench and file into the locker room, where dirty, sweat-stained robes are casually removed and flung in the direction of a laundry cart. “I’ve been skipping the showers and just rubbing a little deodorant under my robes before going home, but that feels kind of gross. And waiting for everyone to leave doesn’t work because [Chief Justice John] Roberts takes super long showers and always stays late.” “Maybe if I just run in and do a really quick rinse it won’t be that bad,” continued the 113th person to serve on the nation’s highest court. Gorsuch confirmed that none of his colleagues seem to share his reservations about appearing naked before one another, noting that Justice Clarence Thomas doesn’t hesitate to tear off his perspiration-drenched robe and hop into one of the ice baths following a long day of legal deliberations. The newest and youngest member of the court added that he was especially caught off guard by 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy’s tendency to wander from locker to locker in the nude as he animatedly recounts and breaks down each of the day’s key arguments. According to Gorsuch, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is known to bring six-packs of Budweiser into the shower following a big victory in a landmark case, which he said is a type of behavior he never observed while on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals back home in Colorado. “There’s usually a lot of whooping and hollering after a verdict is handed down, and it can get a bit rowdy in there,” said Gorsuch, who was assigned a rusted metal locker that has reportedly remained dented since a frustrated Warren Burger slammed his fist into its door after dissenting in the 5-4 ruling of   back in 1972. “Last week Kennedy slingshot his dirty jockstrap into the face of one of the clerks passing out fresh robes, and Roberts hasn’t been able to get his gavel down from the ceiling since [Justice Elena] Kagan stuck it up there with athletic tape. People are always telling me how [Antonin] Scalia loved to sneak up on people changing and snap his towel on their asses, so I’m at least glad I wasn’t around for that.” “Although yesterday, when [Justice] Sonia [Sotomayor] saw I was going to wear my old swim trunks in the shower, she dumped talcum powder all over my head and called me a ‘textualist little bitch,’” the 49-year-old jurist added. Gorsuch went on to say that he is equally reluctant to lower his guard around Justice Samuel Alito, who is known to press his buttocks in the faces of unsuspecting court members when they’re sitting on the locker room’s bench and bending down to tie their shoes. Reflecting on the poor hygienic habits of his colleagues, including the propensity of some to urinate while in the shower, the former appellate judge shared with reporters his fears of contracting a staph infection like the one that spread through the locker room and prematurely ended the 1999 session of the Rehnquist court. “I realize this stuff comes with the territory, and eventually I’ll have to bite the bullet and hit the showers like everyone else,” said Gorsuch, who acknowledged he has already come to accept the open secret of the court’s widespread prescription painkiller abuse. “It’s not that I’m a prude or anything—I just feel a little self-conscious.” “Especially after seeing [Justice Stephen] Breyer’s monster cock,” he added.

"LOS ANGELES—Remembering the many great friendships and opportunities it brought into their lives, a group of Hollywood stars including Judi Dench, Jack Nicholson, Jeremy Irons, and Meryl Streep recalled Thursday getting their start on   in 1993. The group of A-listers, who began their careers on the popular children’s variety show along with other notable cast members such as Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, and Britney Spears, warmly reminisced to reporters about what it was like to have been part of such a talented group of performers, and how they owed much of their subsequent success to the exposure and experience the early ’90s Disney Channel program brought them. “  was the launching pad for so many of us,” said Streep, explaining how the show was vital to helping her land roles in   and  . “I’d been in a couple of smaller things before it, but nothing prepared me for being up on that Disney stage doing ‘The Mickey Mouse March’—I mean, that was the big time. When you’re a Mouseketeer, you’re a household name.” “All of a sudden, agents started calling,” Streep added. “Real Hollywood agents.” Judi Dench, who prior to   had appeared mostly in plays, credited her time on the show with teaching her the practical skills she would need to thrive in the rough-and-tumble film industry. The star of   also candidly told reporters that the ice cream shop skit she appeared in provided her with a better education in acting than any performing arts school could. Fellow class of ’93 alumnus Jack Nicholson expressed similar sentiments, saying that all the while he was having fun covering Shanice’s “I Love Your Smile” in a duet with Christina Aguilera, he was growing up, too. “When I first joined   I was so green,” said Nicholson, who would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1998. “I was this naïve 56-year-old from New Jersey, but singing and dancing to those ’90s pop hits and classic Disney tunes five days a week helped me develop as a performer and as a person. Plus, it really helped having an old hand like JC Chasez there to take me under his wing.” Added Nicholson, “To this day I still know all the steps to the ‘Super Goofy Shuffle.’” Nicholson went on to note how lucky he felt to have been plucked from obscurity and land a featured role on such a high-profile showcase for young entertainers. He said some of his favorite memories from “back in the day” included putting on his official Mickey Mouse–emblazoned letterman’s jacket for the first time, touring Disney stores and theme parks all over the country, and seeing an unknown Daniel Day-Lewis—then barely 36—audition for the show and sensing that, though he wasn’t cast, he’d still be a star someday. But the job also came with its share of stress, according to Jeremy Irons, who said spending so much time away from friends and family was often difficult and was not made any easier by the shock of suddenly being recognized as a Mouseketeer almost everywhere. “Back in the ’90s it seemed like every girl in America had a Jeremy Irons poster hanging in her bedroom,” said Irons, adding that tensions arose among cast members who weren’t considered one of the “cute ones” and weren’t natural singers or dancers. “And there were the love triangles, of course. I remember Justin Timberlake had the biggest crush on Judi Dench, which made things really awkward when he started dating Britney [Spears].” “At the end of the day, though, we always tried to put those disagreements behind us,” Irons continued. “Because we knew we were all there for the same reasons: We loved to sing, we loved to dance, and we loved Mickey.” ",1,"Judi Dench, Jack Nicholson, Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep Fondly Recall Getting Start As Part Of 1993 Mouseketeer Class"

"ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS—Speaking Wednesday from the grounds of the lavish tropical estate where he plans to spend much of his downtime while in office, Donald Trump unveiled a new presidential retreat he hopes will allow him to escape from the grueling pace of life at Mar-a-Lago.  With its sunny climate, secluded setting, and luxurious accommodations, the 45-acre Caribbean hideaway known as Isola Vista—which sits on a pristine white-sand beach along the island of St. Thomas’ southern coast—will reportedly serve as a haven where the president can find respite from his five-star Palm Beach, FL resort and its many day-to-day pressures. “After a while, all that time spent at Mar-a-Lago starts to take a toll,” Trump said of the relentless routine of recreation and extravagance he experiences at his oceanfront Florida club. “I’m there so much that sometimes I just need to get away and clear my head. Here in St. Thomas I’ll have a place where I can simply relax and, for a little while at least, forget about all those headaches I left behind in Palm Beach.” Added the president, “A few days in the Caribbean should be all I need to feel refreshed and ready to get right back to the usual grind of Mar-a-Lago.” According to sources, considerable efforts have been made at Isola Vista to create a tranquil retreat far removed from the rigorous schedule of golf, fine dining, and spa treatments the commander-in-chief faces every single day he is in Florida. His stressful days at Mar-a-Lago reportedly begin at 6 a.m. with a breakfast prepared by a Michelin-starred chef, followed by an early tee time at the award-winning Trump International Golf Club. By the time the last wearying soiree at his private club finally winds down, the president is often completely exhausted, aides say, prompting his decision to decamp to Isola Vista for some much-needed rest and leisure. “It’ll be great to fly down here from Mar-a-Lago and have a little me time,” said Trump, describing how the new retreat will finally let him enjoy some peace and quiet away from his exclusive members-only Florida resort. “The amount of unwinding I’ve done in Palm Beach lately has left me completely drained. Hopefully Isola Vista will allow me to recharge anytime I overdo it at Mar-a-Lago and start to feel run down.” Following his first visit to Isola Vista, presidential advisers confirmed Trump’s time away appeared to have had a positive effect on his mood and energy level. “The new retreat seems to have worked wonders on the president,” Trump aide Jessica Ditto told reporters. “When he returned to Mar-a-Lago, he was eager to dive right back into his packed daily schedule immediately and couldn’t wait to get started on the day’s first hot-stone massage.” ",1,Trump Unveils Sprawling New Presidential Retreat Where He Can Escape From Stresses Of Mar-A-Lago
"WASHINGTON—In what he referred to as an important rite of passage for his 8-year-old son, Donald John III, Donald Trump Jr. took his eldest boy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park for his first-ever hunting trip, sources said Wednesday. The daylong excursion, during which father and son could be seen wearing matching khaki fatigues and safari hats, was reportedly an opportunity for Trump Jr. to introduce the young boy to hunting by showing him how to track a wild animal through a zoo exhibit, set up the perfect shot just outside a fenced enclosure, and, if possible, hit the target right between the eyes as it lies sleeping. “That’s it, D.J.—steady the barrel along the edge of the guardrail, just like that,” Trump Jr. whispered, appearing to swell with pride as Donald John III crouched near an ice cream stand in the zoo’s Cheetah Conservation Station and took aim at a cub playing inside a small enclosure 10 feet below. “Be very quiet or you’ll spook him. Now, whenever you’re ready, just exhale slowly and squeeze the trigger.” “Great shot, son!” Trump Jr. continued as three valets from the hunting party set down the Trumps’ gear and entered the cheetah habitat to field-dress the carcass. “Let’s keep this spot until the zookeeper comes to feed them. When that happens, they’ll all move out into the open and we’ll be able to get a few more.” According to sources, Trump Jr. and his son crept quietly along the paved footpaths—staying low and occasionally ducking behind an information kiosk—in the hopes of remaining undetected as they approached their next targets, Wilma and Zora, the two American bison housed by the zoo. Both animals were reportedly lapping water from a trough and caught unaware, allowing the father-son duo to take each of them out with three quick shots to the head, use a bowie knife to cut off the horns for souvenirs, and then continue on their way to the picnic pavilion for hot dogs and sodas. Arriving at the zoo’s bird sanctuary, the Trumps are said to have switched from big-game rifles to scatterguns, bringing down a dozen flamingos, five whooping cranes, and a pair of North Island brown kiwi as zoo employees and families in the nearby gift shop screamed and ran for cover. “The key to hunting is biding your time, D.J.—wait until those sea lions are trapped between the tank wall and your line of fire so you can get a clear shot at them before they swim away,” said Trump Jr., peering through the scope of his rifle at the aquatic mammals sunning themselves on a concrete embankment. “Later, when we go inside the Great Ape House, you’re going to be tempted to take a shot right away, but you have to be patient.” “Eventually an orangutan will come down from its tire swing to grab a piece of fruit,” he added. “When that happens—bam, you nail him!” Reports confirmed the highlight of the expedition came when Trump Jr. took down the zoo’s giant panda Tian Tian with just two shots, the first bullet shattering the Plexiglas barrier and the second hitting the animal directly in the heart. The Trumps reportedly took the opportunity to pose with their prized trophy, each triumphantly placing a foot on the blood-drenched panda as a hired photographer captured the moment. The jubilant father and son reportedly ended their day by honing their marksmanship at the Small Mammal House, picking off mongooses one by one as they poked their heads out of their burrows. “D.J., I was very proud of you out there today,” a misty-eyed Trump Jr. said as he tousled his son’s hair and tenderly wiped a smear of giant anteater blood from the boy’s cheek. “Maybe someday, when you have a son of your own, you’ll take him to the zoo and kill something really great like a white rhino, or, who knows, maybe you’ll take him to an aquarium and bag a dolphin. Even I haven’t done that.” At press time, having deemed a gazelle carcass too small to make a good wall mount, the Trumps had abandoned the dead animal near a lemonade cart to rot in the sun.

"FREEHOLD, NJ—Saying it hasn’t always been easy inventing reasons for not attending one of his gigs, local man John Gilman, 68, told reporters Thursday that he has spent approximately 50 years coming up with excuses to avoid checking out the band of high school classmate Bruce Springsteen. An insurance adjuster and friend of Springsteen since the mid-1960s when the acclaimed singer-songwriter played small venues in Monmouth County, New Jersey, Gilman told reporters that over the past half century he has falsely cited homework, car trouble, his kids’ baseball games, and late nights at the office as just a few of the reasons he could not be present at Springsteen’s shows. “After the first few times I told him I couldn’t make it, I thought he’d take the hint and figure I just wasn’t interested, but he’s never stopped asking,” said Gilman, who hastened to add that he couldn’t be happier his friend’s band is doing so well. “I love Bruce, but it’s kind of a hassle to drop everything on a Friday night and drive up to Madison Square Garden or wherever. So I tell him I’m too busy to make it this time, but to count me in next time. I’ve been doing that since I was 17 years old.” “I remember back in ’87 he gave me an early demo of   and told me he thought I’d really like it,” Gilman continued. “I thanked him and said I’d give it a listen, but to be honest, it’s just been sitting in a drawer.”  In the decades since his friend formed the E Street Band and began to earn widespread critical accolades for albums like  , Gilman confirmed he has lied about his absence at Springsteen’s concerts by claiming he was sick 37 times, had a dinner party to attend 29 times, was out of town for a cousin’s wedding 18 times, and, on seven occasions, had to get up early the next morning for a dentist appointment. According to Gilman, the closest he has come to actually seeing his friend play was a night in 1971 when he walked by the Upstage Club in Asbury Park, noticed Springsteen’s band was on the bill, and briefly considered going inside. He ultimately concluded, however, that the venue was too crowded and would probably be too hot as well. “It was really hard when he did that 10-night stand at the Meadowlands, because I had to come up with something new to tell him every night,” said Gilman, referring to Springsteen’s legendary series of performances at Giants Stadium during his 2003 tour for  . “It was really sweet of him to send me front row tickets to all of those shows, but big, loud concerts like that just aren’t my thing, you know?” “Now anytime he has that many dates scheduled in New Jersey, I make sure to tell him I’m on vacation,” added Gilman. To Gilman’s surprise, the multiplatinum recording artist has only grown more insistent in recent years, even going so far as to send him a copy of 2012’s Grammy-nominated   and then call him a few days later to ask if he liked it. In order to avoid wounding his friend’s pride, Gilman reportedly glanced at the track list and remarked that “Easy Money” was “really great,” despite having never listened to it or any other song in Springsteen’s 18-album catalog. “Sometimes I get lucky and there’s a real-life event I can use as an excuse, like that time in ’93 when an accident in the Lincoln Tunnel had traffic backed up so bad I wouldn’t have been able to make it to his MTV   taping even if I’d wanted to,” Gilman said. “But for the most part, it just gets harder over the years. There are only so many ways I can change the subject when he asks if I’ve gotten around to checking out ‘Built To Run’ or whatever.” “I do occasionally feel guilty,” he added. “I mean, Bruce and his bandmates have helped me move like half a dozen times.” ",1,Friend Of Bruce Springsteen Has Been Thinking Of Excuses To Avoid Checking Out His Band For 50 Years
"WASHINGTON—Saying the groundbreaking new technology could allow humans to withstand the harsh conditions they will experience on the planet’s surface, NASA confirmed Tuesday that it has created a climate-controlled suit capable of protecting people who hope to one day live on Earth. Agency officials told reporters that the suit, which they have named the Terrestrial Mobility Unit, is specifically engineered to keep humans safe from the extreme temperatures and unbreathable atmosphere found on Earth, increasing the possibility that, decades from now, they may be able to inhabit the dangerous planet.  “Our team has finally created a functional, reliable space suit that humans may someday use to survive the punishing environment they encounter on Earth,” said NASA senior research scientist Catherine Seltzer, who spearheaded the 12-year, $180 million project and helped devise the unique polymers that allow the suit to endure a nonstop bombardment of intense ultraviolet radiation. “From the devastating storm systems sweeping the planet to the many toxic gases filling its atmosphere, Earth will be hostile to human life. But with the Terrestrial Mobility Unit, a person may actually be able to walk safely across its surface.” “As incredible as it sounds, we might even have a permanent human settlement on Earth 100 years from now,” she added. According to NASA, the suit contains a state-of-the-art environmental control system that uses water vaporization to cool the wearer in the midst of scorching temperatures and that filters out poisonous levels of carbon dioxide to maintain oxygen supplies, allowing a person to survive for extended periods of time in the Earth’s unforgiving terrestrial climate. In addition, an impenetrable semirigid fiber has reportedly been incorporated into the suit as protection against an atmosphere expected to be ridden with dense particulate matter, including an unknown number of highly lethal toxins. “Even the slightest contact with the Earth’s atmosphere will quickly prove fatal, so we’ve taken every conceivable precaution,” said NASA engineer James Mullen, explaining that computer simulations showed that unprotected humans exposed to the planet’s sun for any amount of time would immediately suffer fourth-degree burns all over their bodies. “The suit has even been specially fortified with a new high-density polymer-metal composite that can act as a defense in the event of extreme weather events such as acid rain downpours, continent-spanning dust storms, and clusters of Category 5 hurricanes, any one of which can occur at any time, without warning, and last for years.” Mullen went on to say that even a tiny pinprick in the Terrestrial Mobility Unit would cause its wearer to die a horrific death, though there remains debate as to what would kill the person first—extreme temperature, asphyxiation from low oxygen, or the planet’s wildly fluctuating air pressure, which would either boil off a human’s blood or simply crush him or her flat. Despite the substantial protections afforded by the suit, NASA officials were quick to point out that even while wearing it, no human could remain on the Earth’s surface for more than three or four hours before having to retreat to a titanium-reinforced bunker hundreds of feet underground. “The truth is, we won’t know just how the suit will respond to being on Earth until we take those first brave steps 50 or 60 years from now,” Mullen said. “We can run all the tests we want, but at the end of the day we’ll be placing actual human beings on a highly unstable planet with an environment that is extremely unsafe, not just for us, but for all carbon-based life.” “All we can do right now is to continue upgrading our design and hope for the best,” he added. A NASA spokesperson confirmed that excitement for the project has resulted in an accelerated production schedule that could conceivably allow thousands of human beings to be living on Earth by 2075.

"WASHINGTON—Seeking to open his mind to new possibilities for overhauling the U.S. healthcare system, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reportedly witnessed an infinite number of replacement plans Wednesday after dropping acid to inspire ideas for an Obamacare alternative. Shortly after the 75-year-old Republican senator ingested two 100-microgram tabs of LSD in his Congressional office, sources said countless substitutes for the Affordable Care Act began to explode before his eyes in luminescent, hyper-vivid colors and patterns. “Oh my God—I can see the CHIP provisions spreading out in every direction forever and ever and ever,” said a reeling McConnell, gazing wide-eyed as infinite, interlocking fractal combinations of health savings plans, employer-provided coverage, and government subsidies enveloped him in an accelerating stream, eventually passing over him with such velocity that they appeared to be an entire galaxy of stars swirling around him. “Now I can see…I can see the outpatient hospital visits covered for every child in the country! No, every child who’s ever been born, and will ever be born! Even the ones who haven’t yet been conceived!” “The scope of coverage is so beautiful,” added the senator quietly. “Whoa.” According to sources, McConnell’s hallucinations came on slowly, first appearing as a geodesic block grant spiraling gently in the center of the senator’s desk before morphing into a gigantic, prismatic spiderweb of plans whose out-of-pocket prescription expenses expanded and contracted with McConnell’s every breath. McConnell then reportedly turned his attention to the pulsating, roiling carpet in his offices, from which an entire ancient forest sprang as though from the beginning of time, its vines and verdant, leafy canopy composed of untaxed dollars that reached to the ceiling, beneath which the senator said the “whole country would be protected,” eliminating penalties and subsidizing care for 150 million eligible Americans. “Every co-pay is connected to every patient is connected to every beating human heart,” said McConnell as he began to peel off his suit and tie until he was completely nude. “The individual mandate is total bullshit, because the plan is life itself, and you can’t opt in or out of life. And the continuous coverage incentive—well, it’s fucking this! All of this! The river and the sky and the grass and the trees. And it’s you! You and me. We’re all part of the plan.” “Fuck, I’m tripping balls,” added McConnell, waving his hands in front of his face and attempting to grasp at the low-cost, high-value brackets that had presented themselves as glowing orbs. McConnell reportedly grew terrified, however, after claiming to see the skies darken and a huge wall of 400-foot-high premiums rising in the distance while thousands of jagged, ugly shapes representing an overburdened Medicaid system rained down around him, threatening to crush the middle class and, eventually, the whole human race. The senator then fled his office on foot and sprinted into the Capitol rotunda, where sources said he stopped dead in his tracks to stare open-mouthed at the domed ceiling for the next 90 minutes, mumbling in horror about an upper limit on the tax preference for employer plans before the naked and sweating congressman ran out onto the National Mall. Sources later told reporters that at one point, the senior senator from Kentucky caught sight of his own face in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and began to panic, insisting that he saw himself waiting in an out-of-network doctor’s office for 10,000 years due to his own proposed legislation before decaying completely, his flesh falling from his bones in rotting chunks. “He was really freaking out, so I brought him a glass of orange juice and that seemed to calm him down a bit,” said aide James Scholtz, adding that McConnell became fixated on Scholtz’s striped tie and rubbed it gently on his face while repeatedly stating that he no longer feared the massive impact to the federal budget that sweeping healthcare reform would bring—that he in fact welcomed it. “I couldn’t really follow everything he was saying, but he was pretty adamant that his body was an HMO, Earth was the network, the universe was the insurance company, and God was the free-market exchange. Eventually he started crying, so I just patted his hand until [Secretary of Transportation] Mrs. Chao came to talk to him.” After the drug’s effects had worn off, Senator McConnell reportedly surveyed his notes, called them “nonsense,” and then picked himself up from the K Street alley where he had found himself, ready to move ahead with his plan to repeal Obamacare without a replacement.

"ALBANY, NY—Reminiscing about the departed matriarch while partaking in the annual festivities, members of the Osterman family sadly marked their first 4/20 since the passing of their grandmother, sources reported Thursday. Family members wistfully told reporters that grandmother Joan Osterman, who passed away last October at the age of 83, heartily enjoyed the revelry of 4/20 every year, recalling how the elderly woman always had the kindest, dankest nugs and the sweetest perma-grin on her face after ripping a huge bong hit. “It’s just so different celebrating 4/20 without Grandma Joan here,” said 19-year-old Julia Osterman, adding that many of her most cherished 4/20 memories were of her grandmother, from how the older woman was always the first one to wake and bake in the morning, to helping her hang the family’s blacklights and her beloved Peter Tosh “Legalize It” poster. “You’d always know 4/20 was finally here when you’d hear   playing on her old record player and smell the mile-high blondies she’d gotten up extra early to make. It’s not going to feel the same sitting around the hookah as a family without her half passed out on the couch.” “The house is just so much quieter this year without Grandma’s voice constantly encouraging us all to ‘spark another one,’” Julia continued. “I miss her giggle so much.” Other family members agreed that it was hard not to be overwhelmed with emotions on 4/20 when catching a glimpse of their grandmother’s favorite brand of rolling papers or her cobalt blue glass pipe, which they said induced a flood of memories of their departed loved one. “When we were passing the joint earlier and it came back around the circle so quickly, it was just another reminder that she’s really gone,” said Osterman’s son Richard, 52. “There are so many little things she used to do to make 4/20 feel special: the matching stocking caps she knit us, the extra blankets she always had out in case we got the chills. But the thing I’ll miss most is just seeing her sitting in her old bean bag chair, watching that VHS copy of   just completely blazed out of her mind. That’s the way I’ll always remember her.” “Still, as long as her strain of sour diesel is growing out in the backyard, it’s like there’s still a part of her with us,” added Osterman, wiping away a tear.

"ORLANDO, FL—Confirming years of rumored sightings by visitors to the theme park, officials from Walt Disney World said Tuesday that several hundred blind and bedraggled Disney characters are living in caves deep within Space Mountain.  The misshapen mascots, who after decades spent in total darkness have sickly gray skin and cloudy, sightless eyes, were reportedly found huddled together in a network of caverns extending far beneath the popular Tomorrowland attraction. “Our maintenance crew recently spotted an unusual tunnel inside Space Mountain and, after shining a light inside, saw several pale forms skitter away into the darkness,” said Walt Disney World president George Kalogridis, noting that the light caused the mascots to hiss, raise their gloved hands in terror, and flee before anyone could get a good look at them. “Then our workers rounded a corner to find dozens of creatures clinging to the walls of the cavern, including one with scattered patches of fur they identified as Goofy, and another with skin grown over its eyes whom they believe was Minnie Mouse.” “We wish to stress that, while they appear grotesque, they also seem to be harmless,” he continued. “They are incredibly sensitive to sound and scramble deeper into their caves anytime one of the roller-coaster cars speed past.” A team of park engineers who explored the ride’s network of hand-clawed tunnels told reporters they had heard, far away in the darkness, a gasping quack that likely belonged to Donald Duck. They also reported hearing a louder bleating sound that was revealed to have been caused by an emaciated Dumbo whose rib cage was clearly visible beneath his hide and who groped around the darkness with his trunk in search of edible mold. Investigating the source of what they described as “a chorus of horrifying yowls,” several team members reportedly encountered a roving troop of princesses that included Elsa, Cinderella, and Jasmine, all of whom had apparently lived so long in the pitch-black, cramped tunnels that they now clambered about comfortably in their dresses and ball gowns as quadrupeds. “When we were going up that first incline, we saw a few pairs of empty white eyes glowing in the distance, but I just assumed that was part of the ride,” said 37-year-old Brendan Weeks of South Bend, Indiana, one of many Space Mountain riders who have caught a glimpse of the subterranean Disney characters. “Then when we were about to take the big drop, I saw these weird animal things that kind of looked like the Country Bear Jamboree. The one with the banjo was gnawing on some sort of animal carcass. I think it might’ve been another bear.” “But other than that, it was a really fun ride,” he added. Hours into its search of the outer-space-themed ride, the team repelled into a massive foul-smelling cavern strewn with mascot droppings, observing there a rail-thin and jaundiced Chip and Dale lapping runoff from the attraction’s plumbing. One employee recalled being startled as he bumped his head in the dark and shone his flashlight upward to find the Seven Dwarfs hanging from the tunnel ceiling, where they pawed at their tick-ridden beards and waited for a humpbacked Snow White to regurgitate into their open mouths. Sources at Disney speculate that many of the costumed characters have been underground since Space Mountain’s 1975 opening, noting that they have had enough time to develop an acute sense of hearing to compensate for their inability to see. It is believed they can detect when an object falls from the roller coaster, because they quickly scurry out to retrieve any such item and later add it to their nest of hoarded sunglasses, keys, lip balm, and assorted gift shop purchases. Similarly, an eyeless, translucent-skinned Jiminy Cricket reportedly stumbles his way through the labyrinth of dirt tunnels by humming broken strains of “When You Wish Upon A Star” and listening to the echoes of his faltering voice. “We’re really not sure what to do with any of these old mascots,” Kalogridis said. “There’s obviously no place in the Magic Kingdom for a Tinkerbell that emits hideous clicking noises to signal other mascots when they’re in danger.” “For all we know, there could be thousands more down there we aren’t even aware of,” he added. “Not to mention what we’ll find when we drain Pirates of the Caribbean.” At press time, Disney officials confirmed they had cemented shut every entrance to Space Mountain after night-vision cameras in the caves spotted former CEO Michael Eisner skulking in the darkness.

"CHICAGO—Saying he has heard good things but hasn’t yet had a chance to check it out, local 31-year-old Kevin Regan reported Thursday he has been meaning to catch up on the whole of human artistic endeavor. Despite wanting for a while now to “see what all the buzz is about” surrounding the sum total of mankind’s aesthetic creations, Regan admitted he has simply not yet taken the time to “really get into” the 40,000-year-old means of representing the human experience through various visual and auditory media. “From what everyone says, it sounds pretty cool, but I just haven’t gotten around to it yet,” said Regan, who explained he has been meaning to follow up on friends’ recommendations to check out sculpture, photography, the Western literary canon, cinema, printmaking, traditional Asian puppet theater, and all of the performing arts. “I figure I should probably start from the beginning, with Paleolithic ivory carvings, and work my way forward from there. But I’ve also been told there’s some really awesome stuff going on with architecture from the Roman Empire through the European Renaissance, so that could be a good place to start, too.” “I’ve also heard music is pretty great,” Regan added. Although Regan reported having encountered bits and pieces of humanity’s complete artistic output in the past, he confessed he has never taken in the entire collective body of emotionally and culturally expressive works in depth. In particular, Regan mentioned having previously caught brief glimpses of Vincent Van Gogh’s  , the Chrysler Building, and dance, as well as once overhearing a 35-second clip of the 1996 Blackstreet song “No Diggity.” Regan stated that he was motivated to give all of art a try, not only because of the positive word of mouth but also because he frequently feels left out of conversations whenever the topic turns to popular situation comedies, alternative rock, classic Hollywood films, the oeuvre of eighth-century Chinese poet Li Bai, or fictional storytelling in all its forms across the millennia, from oral traditions to the present. “It’s pretty frustrating to hear everyone at work discussing how amazing novels or televised dramas are and for me to have no idea what they’re talking about,” said Regan, adding that he was looking forward to being able to participate in future conversations about pottery, jazz, the woodcuts of Albrecht Dürer, French grand opera, outsider artists like Henry Darger, and  . “I’ve heard from some people that you can pretty much skip everything between 30,000 B.C. and ancient Greece, but I’m worried if I do that I’ll get lost later on. I’ve got a long weekend coming up, so I’ll probably use that as an opportunity to start with early cave paintings and just binge my way right on through to the Dutch masters.” At press time, Regan had reportedly decided to give up on all of art after being disappointed with the first three episodes of  .

"LONDON—Reacting with indignation and frustration as her fiancé admitted his continued omission, furious royal bride-to-be Meghan Markle found herself unable to believe Thursday that Prince Harry had not yet informed the royal family that she is, in fact, black. “Jesus, Harry, what the hell? Are you ashamed of me? Because that’s what this feels like,” said the incredulous Markle, interrupting her stammering betrothed to ask when he was planning on telling them, how he could be such a coward that he’d blatantly betray her trust, and exactly what the fuck he meant by “I didn’t think it was a big deal.” “You say they’ll be cool with it, but seriously, Harry, you don’t know how white people can get about this stuff. I really don’t want to show up to the royal goddamned wedding and suddenly the Queen, Prince Charles, and Camilla Little-Miss-Perfect Duchess of Cornwall are being all weird! I wonder what could make them act like that, huh? Oh, God—please say your brother Prince William at least knows.” At press time, a fed-up Markle responded to the prince’s question of whether she’s calling off the wedding by saying she “just can’t deal right now” and storming out of the room.

"WASHINGTON—Insisting to the nation that it’s totally fine in there and that they definitely don’t need any help, the country’s top experts from the other room reported Friday that 87 percent of loud crashing noises are nothing. Speaking in muffled voices audible from the other side of the wall, the experts confirmed that nearly nine in 10 of these sounds—which included thuds, bangs, and a crash followed by a pause and then several smaller crashes in quick succession—honestly aren’t anything at all. “Not a thing to worry about,” the experts said almost instantaneously after a loud clatter suddenly rang out from the adjacent room. “It’s okay.” “Everything’s okay,” they added. Despite initially reporting “Dammit!” and “God dammit!” separated by several seconds, experts from the other room emphasized that all such preliminary statements should now be entirely disregarded, because the situation is, in fact, completely fine. They went on to clarify that it’s really not a big deal at all and any exasperated groans overheard from the other room should just be ignored. According to the experts, who spoke over the sound of something in the other room shattering, 37 percent of the noises aren’t anything you need to concern yourself with, 29 percent are no problem whatsoever, and the remaining 21 percent are not nearly as bad as they just sounded. In 100 percent of cases, the other-room experts said everything is cool and there is absolutely no reason to get up. Sources stated that the crashing noises from the other room were often followed by a number of quieter sounds, including what seemed to be a series of rapid footsteps and the scraping of an object being dragged across the floor. “Being taken care of,” said the other-room experts. “Yeah, no, it’s fine. Just stay where you are. Just stay in there.” At press time, the clamor had stopped, and after a minute of silence, the experts in the other room overwhelmingly determined that they were so completely fucked.

"LONDON—Visibly upset as she huddled into her chair and glanced around the Family Planning Association waiting room, a nervous Meghan Markle looked over several informational pamphlets Monday while weighing her options regarding her pregnancy. “I suppose I thought Harry and I would have some more time together as just the two of us before we started a family—after all, we only got married a few months ago, we haven’t even gotten our finances in order, and Harry’s not even sure what he wants to do with his life,” said Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex, poring over a brochure titled “Are You Ready To Be A Mother?” as one restless hand rubbed her belly. “I love kids, and spending time with my nieces and nephews is magic, but am I ready to be tied down by my own kids yet? How am I supposed to take care of a baby if I can’t remember to take my birth control? I think Harry would be a great dad, but what if he’s not cut out for parenting? Sorry. Forget it. Anyway, I guess it’s still early enough in the pregnancy that we have some time to think about it.” Markle later said she felt somewhat better about her options after reading the FPA pamphlets concerning adoption.

"DEMBECHA, ETHIOPIA—In a startling find that contributes significantly to the understanding of modern man’s evolutionary development, University of Edinburgh archaeologists working in Ethiopia’s Afar Region announced Wednesday that they have uncovered the preserved remains of the last human to die happy. According to the researchers, carbon dating concluded that the fossilized skeleton is that of a Paleolithic man—nicknamed “Felix” by the team of scientists responsible for the find—who died perfectly contented and unencumbered by regret roughly 30,000 years ago. “It’s truly incredible—Felix unequivocally demonstrates that early humans were still capable of dying completely fulfilled as late as the Upper Paleolithic,” said lead researcher Evgenia Halytsky, who went on to say that scientists had previously believed any such trait had disappeared many millennia earlier. “The vast majority of research points to our species almost never experiencing even a day of serenity for the last million years, so Felix totally upends any of our previous notions about human evolution.” “To think that only 300 centuries ago, a human being actually died happy,” Halytsky added. Researchers said that a spectral analysis of the remains indicated wear in Felix’s lower extremities consistent with a long, confident gait. Additionally, forensic odontology tests revealed that the man had never grinded his teeth, stunning scientists who had until now accepted that this behavior had become ubiquitous at roughly the same time humans developed abstract thought and the capacity to project into the future. Experts also said that measurements of the man’s upper thoracic spine demonstrated that he had walked with his chest thrust forward optimistically and that his vertebrae were completely absent of any curvature that would have indicated his having gone through life with his head held in a drooping manner or with his eyes cast to the ground. But Halytsky told reporters that what is perhaps most exciting about the find is how it sheds light on a series of mysterious and, until now, incomprehensible prehistoric cave paintings discovered in 2009 less than a mile away from the new site. “We are now almost certain that the figure depicted in the paintings leading successful hunts and cheerfully brokering peaceful resolutions among his fellow tribesmen—who was initially regarded as some kind of mythological being—is in fact Felix,” Halytsky said. “This also lends support to the theory that Felix died having been fully aware of the extent of his positive impact on his society, which appears to have been substantial.” “Some of the drawings illustrate him enjoying a family life more loving, affectionate, and tolerant than any we’ve ever seen throughout prehistory or otherwise, leading us to believe that his heart was overflowing with his kinsfolk’s love when he passed away,” Halytsky continued. However, enthusiasm for the recent findings has reportedly been tempered by a competing theory that Felix was only content at the time of his death because he had decided to kill himself and end his agony all at once.

"MINNEAPOLIS—Explaining how the company remains innovative in a fast-paced industry, executives from DigiVista Media told reporters Wednesday that the marketing firm consistently positions itself on the leading edge of what its competitors have been doing for the past few years. “The landscape is always changing, so we’re continually embracing revolutionary ideas that our rivals succeeded with in the past,” said DigiVista senior marketing manager Aaron Reynolds, who credited this approach with keeping the groundbreaking company at the forefront of where the field was five or six years ago. “In this business, you have to constantly push the boundaries in terms of adopting strategies from other people that are by now well-established industry practice.” “You just can’t wait for inspiration to come to you,” he continued. “You’ve got to see it come to somebody else first and then pounce on it once it’s been thoroughly proven in the marketplace.” According to DigiVista CEO Bill Hallihan, employees at his pioneering firm monitor what everyone else in marketing is doing, hastily restructure their business to do the exact same thing, and then watch to see what advancements the industry makes next. Hallihan said it’s this commitment to innovation that allows his company to always provide its clients with the next ingenious product that has already been in use for quite some time. “Part of what makes us such trailblazers is our willingness to completely scrap what we’re doing right now in favor of a strategy that’s been fairly ubiquitous since 2013,” said Hallihan, noting that he hopes a recent rollout of real-time bidding and ad exchange platforms will place DigiVista firmly atop the list of leading marketing firms of the beginning of the decade. “Our creative focus on methods developed by other companies is what’s going to drive our business right to where the vanguard of this industry used to be.”  “Yeah, sometimes we have to push the envelope on what could be done in 2010, but we don’t know any other way around here,” he added. Hallihan hinted that DigiVista is preparing to disrupt the marketing world once more, this time by proactively embracing original concepts that its competitors put in place just 12 to 18 months ago. But he said such a gambit should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the company’s history of taking substantial risks to adopt the very same business plans that other, more successful firms were using just a short while back. “Whether it’s native advertising or advanced data collection, if you can’t deliver what previously paid off elsewhere, you’re finished,” Hallihan said. “But as long as there’s that spirit of innovation in others, we’re going to be around quite a while.” At press time, sources confirmed DigiVista had adopted another years-old strategy of its competitors, laying off approximately 20 percent of its workforce.

"LONDON—Claiming that the fate of the Realm was dependent on the Prince’s continual satisfaction in all his physical needs, Queen Elizabeth II summoned Meghan Markle to her royal bedchamber Friday, where she embraced her granddaughter-to-be, slowly dimmed the lights, and proclaimed, “We must ensure you have the skills to please my grandson,” before letting her nightgown slip languorously to the floor. “As queen, it is my responsibility to properly train you in the erotic duties expected of the Crown,” said the 91-year-old Queen Regnant, ushering her future granddaughter-in-law toward a luxurious canopy bed on which an assortment of feather ticklers, blindfolds, and other pleasure-enhancing items had been carefully arranged. “The fate of all England may someday hinge on you indulging the desires of your husband-to-be in a way befitting a prince; thus, I shall guide you through all the carnal wisdom of our regal forebears, every sensual escalation and lascivious technique known to arouse royal blood. The tantric secrets of Mary, Queen of Scots alone have the power to bring the most frigid of kings and consorts to a transport of ecstasy.” The Queen then reportedly began the process of confirming that Markle was indeed yet a virgin.

"BROWNSVILLE, TX—Racking his brain for something that he could say to stop the child from crying, ICE agent Don Neville was reportedly trying Monday to think of a fun name for a jail cell before locking up a 5-year-old immigrant. “I really thought it would work when I told him he was going to the ‘fun cave,’ but he just started sobbing harder, so I’m running out of ideas,” said Neville, adding that the child had been weeping virtually non-stop since agents separated him from his parents hours earlier and had even rebuffed Neville’s efforts to give him a roll of paper towels to play with. “Jeez, I’m struggling here. How about ‘kid zone’ or ‘the playhouse’? If I can’t think of anything good, I guess I can just tell him that his best buddy the concrete bench is in there, and he can climb onto his pal’s back and pretend that yucky liquid on the floor is hot lava. Maybe he’ll calm down if I say that the jail bars are like a xylophone and he can play a happy tune on them? You know, this would probably be way easier if he knew any English.” At press time, Neville had resolved to simply comfort the immigrant child by informing him that he would soon be joined by hundreds of new friends.

It’s really going to come down to voter turnout, since there are currently more than 800,000 races in a statistical dead heat. Covering them all is a lot of work, but it’s how we ensure Americans will know exactly what to expect on Election Day.” The visibly frenzied Baquet went on to explain that his newspaper would also embark on a series of long-form interviews with 900 billion white working-class Americans who previously voted for Trump.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the measure was necessary to provide more thorough statistical data on the country’s populace, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced Tuesday that a question asking participants to identify any unpatriotic neighbors was added to the 2020 decennial census. “This will aid the U.S. Census Bureau in finally gaining an accurate count of citizens who do not staunchly support the nation’s leaders and policies,” said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, adding that the new questionnaire would prompt respondents to submit the names of any friend, family member, or acquaintance in their community who does not express only the utmost devotion to their country or who voices skepticism about the current administration. “The aim of this question is only to provide complete and precise block-level census data on the traitorous demographic. The information will only be used in policy-making processes and determining the allocation of government funds for services such as law enforcement.” Ross added that residents who refused or neglected to provide complete and correct information would be immediately registered in the 2020 U.S. Census as disloyal and would face stiff punishment.

"On Sunday night, all eyes will be on Hollywood, as the silver screen’s biggest stars gather for a celebration of the year’s greatest moments in cinema. The Academy Awards, now in its 89th year, is a grand and glamorous tribute to the touching performances and technical artistry that, over the past 12 months, made us laugh, cry, and feel closer together. However, given all the joy and entertainment that the film industry has provided to the viewing public, it is the firm belief of this newspaper that these accomplished thespians, screenwriters, directors, and producers deserve far more than just the three and a half hours of recognition they will receive during tonight’s ceremony. Which is why   is extending a formal invitation to all those in attendance at this evening’s Oscars to join us at our official Academy Awards after-party in the village of Sakteng, Bhutan. While there will be no shortage of glitzy soirees in the Los Angeles area following the conclusion of the festivities at the Dolby Theatre, none of them can match the atmosphere and monastic solitude that  ’s post-show extravaganza will provide. We would be honored to host the greatest artistic minds of the movie industry for an evening of silent prayer, butter tea, archery, and A-list company in the high-elevation yak pastures of the Eastern Himalayas. The details are as follows: Sunday, February 26, 2017 9 P.M. PST / 11 A.M.

After a three-hour single-engine plane ride to Yongphulla, you and your fellow stars and starlets will transfer to the waiting four-by-four vehicles for the one-hour drive to Trashigang and the ensuing 90-minute drive to Phongmey village, before beginning the first leg of a two-day sherpa-guided trek to our party tent. After a quick 24-hour altitude acclimation at the base camp, you will simply make your way over the Nachungla Pass at 13,625 feet before beginning your five-hour descent into the Sakteng valley, where you and the rest of Hollywood’s luminaries will change out of your tuxedos and gowns and into traditional yak-hair robes and five-spouted   hats, which will be freshly pressed and waiting. The party will run from 9 p.m. until midnight. Guests will be welcomed upon arrival into Sakteng by local Buddhist monks playing a chorus of   horns as servers offer a traditional spread of hot distilled rice-maize liquor with scrambled eggs. But the splendors of the event do not stop there: Guests will be treated to ceremonial ablutions, followed by a mask dance and an hour of chanted blessings to mountain goddess Jomo Kuengkhar. All attendees are requested to bring an insulated parka, a waterproof hat and gloves, hiking boots, thermal undergarments, a sturdy aluminum-framed backpack, eight liters of water per person, a headlamp, an ice ax, and a desire to carouse the night away with the rest of the big screen’s biggest names.

"SUITLAND, MD—Having “gotten the scoop” from with-it locals in every geographic region of the country, the U.S. Census Bureau Monday released its 2018 Federal Report On Neighborhood Vibes. “The majority of boroughs considered chill in 2017 maintained their cool, laid-back atmosphere, while most of those on the weirder side only continued to get edgier and funkier in 2018,” Census Bureau director Ron Jarmin wrote in his introduction to the 1,076-page report, which assessed all 20,000 U.S. cities and rated residential areas according to vital atmospheric intangibles such as “overall personality,” “chill factor,” and “bro-iness” throughout the year. “Our data also found, however, that many neighborhoods were susceptible to change in the coming decades, especially ones now considered ‘eclectic’ or ‘artsy.’ Unfortunately, given the degree to which many of those are currently populated with aging hipsters, we project they will be overrun with young professionals and working parents as early as 2020.” At press time, Jarmin added that, just as the Census Bureau had found in previous years, the suburbs once again remained a hellishly boring place to live.

"ITHACA, NY—According to a report released Thursday by experts who knew this would happen from the second you opened your mouth, that was a very stupid thing to say. It was a stupid, stupid thing to say, the report continued, and everyone heard you say it loud and clear. “Boy, that was really dumb,” the report read in part, noting that ever since you said that thing, all anyone can think about is how you could have let something so moronic escape your lips. “Basically, you made a huge mistake by saying that out loud, and there’s no way you’ll ever live it down. Never.” “Jesus Christ, what were you thinking?” the report added. Experts confirmed that everyone around you is currently thinking about what you said and using that information to rapidly reassess your worth as an individual. And though the conversation has now shifted to another topic, the report emphasized that people are still very much preoccupied by the stupid thing you said just a few moments ago. In addition, once you have left, everyone will reportedly engage in discussions about what you said and how dumb it was, and any respect they previously had for you will be totally lost. In fact, the report stressed that the social awkwardness you created with your single idiotic comment will definitely outlast the present conversation and will tarnish your future interactions with all who heard it. The experts also noted that not only will people always remember what you said, but they will think of it and nothing else every time they speak with you, see you, or merely hear your name. “Right about now, you are understandably wishing you could take back those ridiculous words,” the report stated. “But you can’t. Not now and not ever. And if you’re hoping that maybe they slipped past even one or two people, we can confirm they didn’t.” “Nice going, genius,” it continued. According to the report, those who heard your dimwitted statement will soon be mentioning it to their friends, family members, and coworkers who were not even present at the time you uttered it. Based on the report’s projections, dozens of individuals will eventually hear about what you said, and in the event you encounter any one of these people, they will have already judged you mercilessly.  “The best thing for you to do right now is to keep your stupid thoughts to yourself, if that’s something you can even manage,” the report recommended, adding that absolutely no one believes for a moment that your stupid remark was an aberration. “Don’t try to fix things, dummy, because you can’t. Just shut the fuck up for once and learn to live with what you’ve done.” “There has always been something wrong with you, hasn’t there?” it continued. “Deep down, you know it.” The report concluded by suggesting you give up trying to learn from your mistakes, because you will inevitably just keep spouting stupid things like this again and again for the rest of your life. Reassuringly, however, the experts also determined that this may not be a problem for long, as everyone is now actively looking for excuses to avoid you. ",1,Report: That Was Very Stupid Thing To Say
"WASHINGTON—Following months of analysis into the animal’s stunning good looks, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that genetically modified salmon are far too handsome to eat. “After several rounds of clinical testing, we have determined that these genetically altered fish are safe for human consumption, but between their striking, rugged good looks and the air of devil-may-care competence they exude, no one should want to eat them,” said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, particularly noting how the engineered salmons’ pouty lips and lustrous silver-blue sheen masked a deep, instinctual desire to swim upstream and spawn like the intertidal bad boys they are. “These salmon may be raised for greater immunity to waterborne pathogens and to produce higher levels of Omega 3 fatty acids than their wild counterparts, but between their supple, hunky bodies and those eyes—These salmon are farmed and dangerous, honey. Therefore, the FDA cannot recommend them for human consumption at this time.” Gottlieb further warned that no amount of genetic manipulation could take a fish away from its true nature and that handsome or not, salmon would never be as kind-hearted as trout.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to respond to the vast and ever-changing dangers faced by the nation’s commander-in-chief, Secret Service administrators announced Wednesday the creation of an Emotional Protection Division to safeguard President Donald Trump’s psyche. The new unit’s three dozen agents, who have undergone rigorous training to prepare for their challenging role, will be charged with defending the 45th president’s psychological well-being around the clock, investigating foreign and domestic threats to his self-esteem and quickly intercepting any spoken or written criticisms before they can harm his pride. “After conducting a full review of the operational procedures available to us, it became clear that adding this new division was the only way to meet President Trump’s emotional security needs,” said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, noting that the president’s detail is specially trained in assessing risks and minimizing any opportunity for him to feel insecure or belittled. “His psyche could be put in grave danger from unfavorable poll numbers or suddenly come under attack from a White House press corps heavily armed with uncomfortable questions.” “All of our agents stand ready to lay down their lives to ensure nothing can hurt President Trump’s feelings,” he added. According to officials, the Secret Service is reportedly conducting careful background checks on White House visitors to look for any red flags, such as A-list celebrities who might choose to decline a photo op with Trump. The department has also instituted measures to screen the president’s mail for messages that do not reinforce his belief in his own superiority, and to sweep any room before he enters to remove high-risk copies of   and  .  High-ranking agency sources told reporters that their tireless efforts have already made the president’s psyche significantly more secure. In particular, they cited occasions in which agents have shielded Trump against credible attempts on his vanity, saying they have kept him away from photographs on the internet in which he appears in an unflattering light and from news reports indicating that some television programs have garnered higher ratings simply by mocking him. “We’ve already had one really close call,” said Clancy, citing an incident in which a member of the Secret Service jumped directly in front of Trump to prevent him from seeing primetime news coverage of massive rallies held to protest his administration. “But the moment we detected a risk, a few brave agents rushed in to surround the president and place their hands over his ears, safely ushering him into his motorcade before he could hear more than a few words of criticism.” “The president was then immediately taken to a secure location where he was evaluated for any injury to his self-importance,” Clancy continued. While acknowledging the assignment’s significance, several agents bemoaned the difficulty of keeping a vigilant eye upon the constantly evolving risks to Trump’s feelings, observing that whenever the president travels, the Secret Service must vet his destination days or even weeks in advance to ensure it is free of anything that could pose any risk of offense. “It’s incredibly demanding work because his ego is such a big target,” said Roger Mercer, 36, an agent in the Emotional Protection Division. “There are new threats emerging every hour, and if even one of them gets through to him—really gets through to him—it’s all over.” “I can already tell the next four years are going to be the hardest of my career,” he added.

"WASHINGTON—Saying no one in the country is responsible or reliable enough to serve as a legal guardian, child protective services officials from all 50 states confirmed Friday that they had found all of the nation’s adults unfit to be parents and had taken custody of approximately 80 million children. Child welfare workers told reporters they removed all persons under the age of 18 from their unsuitable living situations and placed them under state supervision after home visits revealed that none of the 68 million parents in the United States possessed the judgment or emotional maturity necessary to raise a child. “Throughout the nation, investigations into the home environments of children failed to find a single household in which parents were serving as positive role models in any way,” said U.S. Administration for Children and Families spokesperson Lisa Young, describing how caseworkers entered homes to find kids eating food of no nutritional value and staring vacantly at the screens of tablet computers. “We soon determined American adults are utterly incapable of setting a good example when it comes to healthy habits or personal behavior.” “The moment you meet these people, you realize they have absolutely no business being parents,” she added. Dispatched to homes nationwide, social services representatives said they typically encountered children who were seated in front of a television for hours at a time, with their parents engaged in the very same sedentary behavior on a nearby couch and only interacting with their children to ask what they wanted from the drive-thru. Reports indicate that in some cases, that request was made while the parent stared directly into their smartphone and with no attempt at eye contact whatsoever. According to public records, in the past week, millions of parents have faced child custody hearings, and in every case, judges ruled that the children, many of whom were so unhealthy they reportedly became winded as they climbed the steps of their local courthouse, should become wards of the state. “The amount of time these kids were allowed to remain indoors—only leaving the house to go to school or play video games at a friend’s house—was clearly a danger to their physical well-being,” said social worker Jonathan Froman of Cook County, IL, echoing the concerns of his colleagues across the country. “And to see so many of them subsisting entirely on chicken nuggets or Easy Mac—it breaks my heart.” “I mean, my god, they’re just kids,” added Froman. Evidence suggests that the majority of the nation’s children were also underperforming at school, something that their apathetic home life contributed greatly to, with many parents only willing to spend a few insignificant minutes assisting their children with homework, and even the more involved ones being totally unequipped to help in any meaningful way. In addition, when asked, most parents were unable to name their child’s teacher or, at best, offered a rough approximation of a name actually from two grades prior. “These children also struggle with temper issues, which is to be expected given the profound deficit of interpersonal skills among American parents,” Froman said, adding that it may be impossible for many children to overcome the maladaptive behaviors they have acquired from watching their parents rage at their own inability to properly assemble a bookcase, bully a waiter who failed to bring out entrees with acceptable speed, or simply bicker with each other over nothing of consequence year after year. “We’ll do our best to help them, but I don’t know if they’ll ever recover to a point where they can lead fulfilling lives as adults.” “I only wish we had found these kids sooner,” he added.

"WASHINGTON—Admitting that his competitive spirit got the best of him, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry apologized Friday for trying to outdo his fellow cabinet members by spending $72 million of taxpayer money on a lampshade. “I deeply and sincerely regret becoming swept up in the office-decorating fervor of my colleagues and subsequently allocating over $70 million of my department’s budget for this lampshade,” said Perry, who admitted he ordered the shade from an antiques agent in Paris’ Porte de Clignancourt district to impress other cabinet members after seeing Ryan Zinke’s cocobolo-and-stingray-leather office door and the lavish Moroccan tapestries hung throughout the waiting area of Ben Carson’s “Desert Caravan”-themed office. “American citizens should not have to shoulder the cost of paying for a lampshade woven from vucana silk, hand-stitched with contrasting saffron-spider thread, and crowned by the world’s seventh-largest ruby, so I will be returning the lampshade in its lacquered presentation box as soon as a Learjet can be chartered to convey it.” Despite parting with the lampshade, Perry will keep the the lamp itself, which his grandfather fashioned from a football-shaped Jim Beam decanter commemorating the 1964 Cotton Bowl.

"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the experience would be extremely awkward for each side, President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he is really hoping not to run into the U.S. populace after his term ends. Obama said that once his presidency officially draws to a close on Friday, he would ideally have little or no interaction with his 324 million former constituents, adding that if he ever unexpectedly crossed paths with the American people while going for a walk or doing errands, he hoped they could each quickly continue on with their day with just a passing exchange of pleasantries. “I’m going to try to steer clear of them, but it’s really only a matter of time before I bump into them on the street or out at a restaurant or something,” said Obama, emphasizing that while he had nothing against the United States citizenry personally, it would be highly uncomfortable to make forced small talk about how they’re doing and what they’ve been up to recently. “It’s not like I can avoid them forever. I have to go to the supermarket, don’t I? I’m sure they’ll ask about my family and what I’m doing nowadays, and I’ll have to give a whole spiel about how things are good and that I’ve been keeping busy—that kind of stuff.” “God, I’m just dreading the whole thing,” the president added. While conceding that he would almost inevitably encounter the populace and have no choice but to engage in a few minutes of strained conversation, the commander-in-chief said he planned to reduce such chance meetings by keeping his distance from those places where he knows the nation’s inhabitants frequently gather or at least by restricting his visits to times when they would be less likely to be around. Obama admitted, however, that if he did bump into the American people despite such precautions, he might simply pretend not to notice them. “Maybe I could just kind of wave at them from a distance and keep walking,” said Obama, noting that such a fleeting interaction might be enough to make the public feel acknowledged while also sparing him the lengthier back-and-forth he intensely hoped to avoid. “I feel like that’s the most I can handle right now. Seriously, just the thought of minding my own business at a gas station or wherever and suddenly finding myself in some excruciating chitchat with the general population is kind of a nightmare.” Despite his apprehension about encountering the American public, Obama acknowledged that it’s likely he could change his position at some point in the future, when things might possibly be “a little less weird.” “Sure, down the line, I could see us maybe chatting for a bit,” said Obama, who noted it might take another administration or two before he feels he could comfortably interact with the public again. “For now, though, I really want to just do my own separate thing and let the American people do their thing. No ill will at all. But come January 21, I guess I’m not really going to have all that much to say to them.” Added Obama, “Eight years is a long time, you know?” ",1,Obama Hoping He Doesn’t Run Into U.S. Populace After Presidency
"NEW YORK—Declaring that their outlook is as hopeful as it’s been in decades, an overwhelming majority of the world’s cockroaches said in a poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center that they felt “highly optimistic” about the future of the planet. The poll, which surveyed 500 million of the nocturnal scavenging insects, found that more than 95 percent believe the environment is headed in the right direction, and that in the coming years the conditions in their sewer, rotted-wood, and residential habitats stand to improve dramatically. “With everything that’s been happening in the world, I just can’t help but be encouraged,” said a 6-month-old brown-banded cockroach from a Queens, NY, bathtub drain, adding that with the stakes as high as they are, it was a relief that so much progress was being made. “These days, it seems like there’s always another bit of news about carbon emissions, water quality, or nuclear proliferation that cockroaches can get excited about, not to mention the fact that the alley right outside has dumpsters with enough half-eaten takeout to guarantee we’ll never go hungry.” “It just puts my mind at ease to know my hundreds of kids are going to inherit a planet where they can thrive and where they can one day deposit their own egg cases without worrying,” she added. Across species, cockroaches offered robust support for prevailing trends in environmental policy, with 86 percent expressing enthusiasm for technologies such as fracking and open-pit mining, 81 percent praising the growing demand for disposable consumer goods, and 84 percent saying they were happy with the amount of industrial runoff in ground soil. Another 4 percent reportedly skittered away beneath a baseboard crevice before answering any questions. The survey also noted an unusually dramatic shift in cockroach attitudes in just the past year, with optimism about the planet’s future plummeting after the Paris climate agreement was signed last April, but then suddenly rebounding to an all-time high by the second week in November. “Even though progress hasn’t always been smooth, I’m more and more confident that the planet is on the right track and that roaches are going to be okay,” said a 7-week-old German cockroach from a Minneapolis-area pile of decaying leaves. “And don’t forget, this just doesn’t happen on its own. It’s because of the prudent decisions that are being made by world leaders as we speak.” “They have my complete faith,” he added. “I know they’ll do what’s best for us.” ",1,Cockroaches Feeling Very Optimistic About Future Of Planet
"WASHINGTON—Saying it was imperative that citizens take action now to help protect the natural world, the World Wildlife Fund urged Americans Thursday to just grab whatever animal they can find and try to keep it alive for as long as possible. Leaders of the conservation group, who cited the ongoing mass extinction of species that has resulted from rising global temperatures and irreversible habitat loss, said U.S. residents should immediately locate the closest animal to them, pick it up, hold it in a protective embrace, and then do everything in their power to prevent it from dying. “We cannot afford to wait another second to preserve our fragile ecosystems, which is why we’re asking everyone to go look out your window right now, and if you see any form of animal life—any kind at all—go grab it and do whatever you can so that it keeps living,” director of communications Beth Soto told assembled reporters, stressing that Americans must not hesitate to act and pointing citizens to meadows, public parks, the branches of trees, and other areas that are likely to contain animals they can assist. “We just ask that you make sure the animal is alive when you pick it up and that you check it every once in a while after that to make sure it’s still alive. If it begins to look like it’s dying, try to feed it or hydrate it or help it in some other way until it looks like it’s not dying anymore.” “It doesn’t matter if it’s a lizard, a bat, a muskrat, or a fish,” she continued. “At this point, we’re asking you to protect literally any animal you come across.” Soto emphasized that humans no longer have time to pick and choose which species they wish to preserve, and their only remaining hope is to direct their efforts toward saving whatever creatures happen to be nearby, whether that means running into their own backyard and scooping up a squirrel, picking up ants, beetles, and other insects they may spot on the sidewalk, or stopping their car, running out to grab a Canada goose from the roadside, and pulling it to warmth and safety in the backseat of their vehicle.  Officials from the World Wildlife Fund further pleaded with citizens to use whatever makeshift means they have at their disposal to keep the animals from perishing, underscoring their point by noting that some marine creatures—including frogs, beavers, trout, and small- to medium-sized sharks—can be kept in one’s bathtub, and that anyone with a spare bedroom could be using it to protect a family of groundhogs, a colony of bees, or a single large animal, such as a bison or panther. “If you happen to be looking at an animal right at this moment, please stop listening to me and go help that animal continue living,” said Soto, who noted that many animals could be fed basic household food items, but added that it would be wise to consult the internet to determine if the particular species in one’s possession has strict dietary requirements. “To be honest, you don’t even really have to keep it all that healthy—alive is good enough. As long as it keeps taking breaths, that’s a good thing. We’re really not that picky at this point.” “And frankly, it doesn’t even have to be an animal,” she added. “If you’re able to grab a small plant or some grass and help it survive, that’s great too.” Sources confirmed that Soto then abruptly ended her remarks mid-sentence, rushed out of the briefing room and onto the adjacent courtyard, and lunged headlong toward a perched sparrow.

"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging the gender discrimination she faced in her field before receiving President Trump’s nomination to become the first female director of the CIA, career intelligence officer Gina Haspel recalled Tuesday having to torture many more prisoners than her male colleagues to prove herself. “For a long time, no one would take me seriously even though I was abusing twice as many detainees and employing far crueler methods than most of the men I worked with,” said Haspel, the current CIA deputy director, adding that her work overseeing the “Cat’s Eye” secret prison in Thailand in the early 2000s proved she could run an extralegal black site just as well as any man. “It was really frustrating how I’d have to continually come up with more innovative and brutal ways to torture high-value assets just to receive the slightest bit of recognition from my superiors, whereas the men who held the same position as me could just coast by on the same old sensory-deprivation techniques. I mean, I had to waterboard one suspected al-Qaeda member 83 times in a single month until he lost an eye—you think any of my male coworkers had to work that hard to get ahead? When you’re a woman, they never fully appreciate the things you do for them. It doesn’t matter how many videotapes of illegal torture you help destroy on the CIA’s behalf.” Haspel added that she hoped her promotion would help usher in a new age where there were more women like her in power.

"WASHINGTON—Saying he needed to turn his life around before “ending up in deep shit,” outgoing Vice President Joe Biden was reportedly hatching plans Friday to go completely legit now that his term in office has concluded. Biden, who longtime aides confirmed had made numerous phone calls inquiring about good, honest minimum-wage jobs, vowed to cease taking part in a variety of scams and petty crimes and move far away from the nation’s capital, where he believed he could finally make something of himself and become a productive member of society.  “I’ve lived like there’s no tomorrow for fuck knows how many years now, but mark my words, sooner or later, if I don’t straighten out, some hardass will be throwing Uncle Joe in the joint or a pine overcoat,” said the vice president, who expressed a deep sense of regret that his back-alley street dice game, his “plum” fencing racket, and his bootleg merchandise operation had caused so much pain for loved ones. “Everybody knows trouble fits me like a pair of tight cutoffs that only cover half your ass cheeks. I’ve done plenty of things I’m not proud of, and a whole lot more that I sure as hell can’t remember. Got nothing to show for it except a few scars, a bitchin’ spoiler on the Zam, and a rap sheet longer than my dong.” “From now on, I gotta keep a low profile and steer clear of Johnny Law,” continued Biden. “It’s time for Ol’ Joe to play it straight.” The vice president reportedly took a long drag from a cigarette and slowly exhaled through his nostrils while describing the shady deals and criminal offenses that ultimately led to his sudden desire to “get [his] ass in gear” and “ditch this dump of a city once and for all.” Biden told reporters he had grown sick of the all-night parties, sleeping in past noon every day, and keeping his head on a swivel for rival “bud peddlers,” hired guns, and any number of “batshit crazy” members of Congress he had “gotten into dustups with” during his six terms in the Senate. In addition, White House officials confirmed that Biden had repeatedly asked outgoing President Obama in recent weeks to pull a few strings to enroll the 74-year-old in the Federal Witness Protection Program. “I’ve been on the horn hitting up Barry to do me a real solid and help old Joey Scranton out of this jam,” said Biden, adding that a fresh start in a faraway place with a new identity would be the easiest way for him to leave “the game” and keep him out of county lockup. “Lately, all my ‘sure things’ have been pretty iffy, so I don’t give a rip where I set up shop. I just need to cut out and stop rubbing elbows with a bunch of good-for-nothing dirtbags like the Gooch, T-Bone, and Pelosi, who will sell you out in zero seconds flat as soon as the fuzz start sniffing around.” “I can hang my hat anywhere and keep myself squeaky clean as long as I’ve got some green coming in and Blaze at my side,” the vice president added. “I also asked Barry to do right by Jill and hawk a pound of the dank yerba I stashed up in the fireplace in the Oval Office so she has a sweet nest egg. Might not make it back to these parts, so I told him to say so long to Jilly for me, since I’m not into big send-offs.” The vice president informed reporters he was ready to settle down and find a profession that was on the level, noting that he would be “sitting pretty” as long as he landed a job that brought in $12,000 a year, and mentioning he would gladly accept a “real cushy” position washing dishes at a restaurant, fetching shopping carts at a supermarket, or selling car parts at a reputable chop shop. Biden added he was also “keeping an ear to the ground” for any roadie gigs “hauling amps” for Foghat. “I’m too damn old to be living outside the law anymore—you can’t keep pissing into the wind forever,” Biden said. “I just want to be a totally upright citizen who busts his hump for the man all day, punches the clock, and then heads home to pull bongs until dawn. Just like everybody else.” At press time, sources confirmed Biden heard the sound of distant sirens, stated “I gotta tear ass out of this rathole town,” and scrambled out a second-story window.

"CEDAR PLAINS, PA—After years of delays and mounting criticism from voters and political pundits, President Barack Obama finally followed through on a campaign promise he made in 2008 to spend one night alone in the abandoned Cedar Plains Family Fun amusement park, sources confirmed Wednesday. At approximately 6 p.m. last night, members of the press reportedly looked on as Obama—carrying only a flashlight, a water bottle, and a backpack full of snacks—scaled the 9-foot-high chain-link fence and entered the derelict theme park, making good on a vow that had been a central component of his initial run for the White House. “Eight years ago, I made an oath that if I were elected president, I would spend dusk till dawn in this old, run-down amusement park, and tonight I am fulfilling my obligation to the American people,” said Obama, who had been widely accused of favoring other legislative priorities above an overnight stay inside the dilapidated regional attraction that shut its doors in 2003. “Between now and sunrise, I will climb to the top of the Ripsaw roller coaster, I will throw a rock through the window of the snow cone stand, and just as I’ve said time and time again, I will wander around in the big concrete track where the Lazy River used to be.” “And to prove that I do not take your support for granted, I will also walk through the Hall of Mirrors at midnight,” Obama added. Since first raising the issue during the 2008 primaries, Obama’s promise to spend at least 12 hours unaccompanied within the overgrown park grounds has been a focal point of his domestic policy. Throughout the general election, his repeated vows to climb down into the basin under the Gopher’s Gulch log flume and spend 10 minutes inside one of the rusted cars on the Ferris wheel became fixtures of his stump speeches and TV ads, characterizing the young Illinois senator as the only candidate willing to brave the eerily barren park in the dead of night. However, with the pledge still unfulfilled after Obama’s first 100 days in office, activists began protesting outside the White House regularly, demanding to know when the president would finally put on a thick coat, walk across the property’s cracked parking lot to the padlocked gates, and implement his much-discussed plan to stroll down Cedar Plains’ debris-strewn midway under the light of a full moon. “At a time of great strife when Americans were looking for something to rally around, Obama united the country by swearing that one of his top goals would be to crawl under the wooden barricades and investigate the park’s old food court,” said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that Obama built momentum around his candidacy and attracted sizable political donations whenever he mentioned the possibility of finding old funnel cake and cotton candy machines that had gone unused for years. “So perhaps it was inevitable that there would be backlash when Obama’s first two years elapsed without him providing even a basic outline of how he would break into the amusement park or a list of which of the decrepit rides he would see if he could turn back on.” “Frankly, he got lucky when the bin Laden raid took everyone’s attention away, or else he may not have been reelected,” Halperin added. In an effort to help secure his presidential legacy, Obama returned to his campaign pledge earlier this year, announcing to the nation during his State of the Union address that he had purchased a sleeping bag in anticipation of spending a night in the park, and later telling graduates in a speech at Howard University that before he left office, he would do everything in his power to take a picture from inside the Gravitron to show people what it looked like in there now. “I was really impressed with Obama when he was first running because he seemed like the only candidate who actually had the will and the temperament to spend the whole night in a spooky boarded-up amusement park,” said Kansas City, MO resident Angie Hartney, noting that the then-senator’s claim was one of the primary reasons she supported him in 2008. “I still think he should’ve done this back in his first term, but after all the compromises and excuses—and it seeming like he’d never actually go down into the underground storage rooms where they supposedly keep some of the old bumper cars—it’s great to know he still has the power to inspire people.” “That’s the Obama I voted for,” added Hartney. At press time, the president’s approval rating had risen to an all-time high as an exhausted but triumphant Obama emerged from the park holding a tattered stuffed animal from the shuttered ring toss stand.

"CHICAGO—Promising that every effort would be made to limit the impact on residents’ day-to-day lives, Chicago officials announced Wednesday that a fleet of plows was working around the clock to clear more than 18 inches of fresh bullet casings that had blanketed the metropolitan area overnight. Sources at the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation confirmed that over 250 ammunition-removal vehicles had been deployed to deal with the knee-deep layer of spent cartridges, which have been steadily accumulating on Chicago’s streets, alleys, and pedestrian walkways since the previous evening. “Our crews have been out there all night trying to make our roadways passable, but given how quickly the handgun and semi-automatic shells have piled up, it’s going to take some time,” DSS commissioner Charles L. Williams told reporters, thanking the public for its patience while crews made their way across the stricken municipality. “We’re making good headway, but as you can imagine, it’s not an easy job, especially with casings continuing to fall throughout the city.” “So unless you have an emergency, we’re urging all citizens to stay put for the time being,” he added. “Right now, it’s just not safe to be out in such treacherous conditions.” Williams stated that as casing levels surpassed 12 inches, scores of extra workers from outside the city were called in to help keep pace with the buildup. In addition, numerous dump truck crews have reportedly been tasked with carting off entire trailers full of cartridges from the hardest-hit areas and depositing them in nearby landfills before circling back to pick up more. According to sources, by the morning rush hour, over 300 public and private schools in the Chicago area had been either closed or delayed due to concerns over the large amounts of ammunition covering the city. Citing increased hazards, officials further advised residents to stay off back streets and avoid venturing out at night. “Man, it’s brutal out there,” said Paul Bergeron, 34, a resident of the Lawndale neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side, showing reporters where plows had piled up over nine feet of empty casings in the parking lot of the grocery store across from his apartment. “I ran out to Walgreens, and on my way back, I nearly took a spill trudging through all the .40-caliber shells—I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible.” “Growing up in Kansas, I never saw anything nearly like this, but it is what it is,” he continued. “When you’re living here, you learn to deal with the bullets and adjust your life accordingly.” Some locals, however, have complained that the areas receiving priority attention from the city’s plows were not consistent with those that had been most severely affected. In Chicago’s western and southern neighborhoods, for example, eyewitnesses reported that cartridges had risen as high as some first-floor windows, making it difficult for the occupants to even open their front doors. “The plows always seem to get to the rich neighborhoods first, that’s for sure,” said Gloria Hawkins, 53, a lifelong resident of the South Side community of Auburn Gresham. “Down here, you have no choice but to go out there into the ammo and shovel your car out yourself. It can be pretty frustrating when things are really bad out, because by the time you finish clearing the walk in front of your house, there’s already an inch or two of fresh bullet casings piling up where you started.” “But we’ll get through it, just like we always do,” Hawkins continued. “This city is very much used to this sort of thing.” ",1,City Of Chicago Working Around Clock To Clear 18 Inches Of Bullet Casings From Streets
"Every 12 months, the editorial board of this newspaper convenes to select the recipient of our highest annual honor, and indeed, one of the most esteemed and renowned prizes in the world of journalism:  ’s Fish of the Year. The members of our selection committee do not take such a task lightly, and this year, as in all others, they closely and carefully evaluated the many available candidates on a wide variety of criteria, respecting the full weight of the accolade they were entrusted to bestow.  Sometimes our honoree is chosen based on its prominence in that year’s news cycle. Other times, a Fish of the Year is selected because of its ability to inspire or to bring about meaningful change. This year,  ’s editors began their deliberations by asking one simple question: Which fish, among all others, embodied the tone and spirit of 2016 as no other fish could? The answer was unequivocal. That’s why, for the year 2016,  ’s Fish of the Year is this fish. While at 6 inches and 12 ounces this axillary bream might seem at first an unassuming choice, it’s this fish’s quiet dignity and resilience in the face of aquatic turbidity that secured its spot as this year’s most influential. Indeed, on matters of filter feeding, scale luster, and avoiding predation, this freshwater fish clearly stood above all others. It should be known that our editorial board made its decision well aware that it was likely to be controversial. When selecting a single winner out of trillions of potential candidates, one could argue that any choice is bound to incite heated debate. Some will no doubt argue that this year’s winner is a repeat of 1954’s contentious Fish of the Year selection, when   chose a relatively unknown haddock over a much more prominent 140-pound wels catfish. Others may even find this year’s winner as divisive as our bold and conceptual selection in 2006, when we notably named You, The Reader as the recipient of our annual award. However, our selection committee is confident in its choice. After evaluating individuals from over 30,000 fish species on categories ranging from swimming speed, to extent of spawning territory, to ability to survive in varying currents and water temperatures, it is our newspaper’s position that there was no other viable option. For many Americans, when they think of 2016, they think of this fish. For those still unconvinced, the editorial board would like to make it known that there is ample precedent for this decision. Consider our famous 1960 pick of an Arctic char as a compromise choice in a crowded and divided field of candidates, or our 1974 selection of a basa fish that so well captured the paranoia and suspicion of the post-Watergate era. Now as then, there were many excellent alternate choices, including a northern pike and an unidentified silver-and-yellow fish that we briefly spotted off the southern tip of New Zealand. But when placed head-to-head with other contenders, our winner proved itself again and again, most notably with its ability to live in waters from West Africa to Northern Europe, its tendency to grow to 7 to 9 inches in length, and its maximum lifespan of 18 years. In short, we believe the choice of this fish speaks for itself. Of course, that doesn’t mean this fish is without fault—in fact, there is much about it to criticize. Nor does naming it Fish of the Year mean that we support everything this fish stands for. Take, for example, its refusal to swim below a depth of 30 feet, which our editorial board disagrees with sharply. But ever since we began choosing a Fish of the Year with our selection of a flathead grey mullet in 1926, our vow has been to “choose that fish which has most defined the events and character of that year, regardless of its moral standing.” It is our opinion that this year’s fish honors and upholds this grand tradition. And indeed, in these trying and uncertain times, this exemplary bream stands as a noble example of the type of fish we can all admire, if not aspire to ourselves.

"NEW YORK—Saying the global computer network will cease to be available to users as of midnight tonight, the people of the world announced plans Wednesday to shut down the entire internet until such time as a good use for it can be found.  According to the earth’s 7.5 billion inhabitants, the internet—a technology that allows every human on the face of the planet to communicate and share data with every other human—seemed like an excellent idea at first. But while limited parts of the internet were deemed beneficial and may one day be salvaged, the global populace concluded that the overwhelming majority of it is really awful, and in some cases, even dangerous. “Sure, it’s convenient to have this staggering amount of data at your fingertips, but once you consider that almost none of it is put to any kind of productive use, it just doesn’t seem worth it having it around, you know?” said Cleveland-based internet user Rhonda Tibbs, 39, echoing the thoughts of all humanity as she described a technology that mostly serves to amplify the voices of alienated, misinformed, and overly aggressive people. “I think it was actually okay in the beginning, even helpful. But, man, it really has gone off the rails.” “That’s why we’re pulling the plug, right now, before it gets any worse,” Tibbs added. Speaking to reporters, individuals across the globe cited social media as perhaps the internet’s most problematic component, having wrongly assumed it was wise to allow people to share their opinions via a tool that generously rewards whoever makes the most shocking and abhorrent statements most frequently. But the populace also observed that the internet, originally designed as a way for research institutions to share data, was now largely a repository of sponsored content, pop-up ads, movies no one will ever watch, spam, elaborate identity theft schemes, bank accounts vulnerable to hacking, middle-aged men badly covering Aerosmith on YouTube, futile online petitions, grossly embellished OkCupid profiles, spyware, fan-generated   erotica, celebrity gossip, anti-Semitic memes, revenge porn, deceptive apartment listings, and death threats. “The internet is horrible—there’s so much of this thing that people just shouldn’t be using at all,” said Graham Curtis, a 52-year-old Dublin, Ireland, resident. “I think the original idea was that you’d log on and express a viewpoint, and then someone else would express theirs. Then some kind of semi-constructive dialogue would take place. Instead, you go online and someone almost immediately tells you he’d laugh so hard if you offed yourself.”  “I’m glad we’re taking it down, and if it ever gets put back up, hopefully there will be some kind of quality control,” he added. “If you’re using the internet just to tell me what your 10 favorite Amy Adams movies are, and not even in any particular order, then maybe you shouldn’t be using it at all.” Across the world, discussions have taken place as to how the internet, if it is one day revived, could be made less appalling. Several guidelines have reportedly been proposed, including a minimum age requirement and a questionnaire aimed at identifying the most frivolous or virulent users, and then either barring them entirely or corralling them inside a section of the internet dedicated to people who do nothing but make humanity worse. While access to email and online weather services would remain largely unchanged, sources confirmed that Reddit and 4chan would be eliminated entirely, and the internet would be strictly limited to a single, reliable database of song lyrics. “We can put the internet back up eventually, but right now we need to take a step back and really think about what we want from it,” said Devansh Patel, 27, of Chennai, India. “Linking networks of computers to facilitate the free exchange of ideas was great in theory, but it just hasn’t produced anything of merit. I still think it has potential, though, and with any luck, we can bring it back in my lifetime.” “Nevertheless, I think everyone agrees the next internet should contain only factual information,” he continued. “I’m not sure why they didn’t think of that in the first place.” ",1,World Agrees To Just Take Down Internet For A While Until They Can Find A Good Use For It
"WASHINGTON—Joining the ranks of the unemployed at a time when joblessness remains stubbornly high among African Americans, 55-year-old local black man Barack Obama has lost the full-time job he has held for the past eight years, sources confirmed Friday. A father of two and his family’s sole breadwinner for much of the past decade, the dismissed African-American employee was reportedly instructed to vacate his workplace by the end of the week, after which he will no longer be on his employer’s payroll. “Minorities continue to face challenges in the job market even when they possess extensive qualifications and experience,” said Gerald Harmon, chief economist with the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. “While the U.S. economy has enjoyed a record 75 months of continuous job growth, the grim reality for Mr. Obama is that the unemployment rate among black Americans continues to hover at around 8 percent.” “We’ve seen tremendous gains since the labor market bottomed out seven years ago, but unfortunately for this man, and many other people of color, we still have a long way to go,” he continued. According to sources, the local black resident has cycled through at least three different occupations since turning 40, and was in serious danger of losing his job four years ago. Reports indicate that after taking the position in 2009, he faced daily antagonism from his mostly white colleagues, who reportedly never stopped questioning his qualifications and competence, a situation that is said to have made it difficult for him to perform the duties assigned to him. As such, sources asserted that the man faced greater challenges in the workplace than a white person with the same job would have, and had to work much harder to achieve even the smallest amount of respect. Acquaintances noted the working conditions soon began to take a visible toll on his health. “What makes his circumstance even more tragic is that the job he had wasn’t even that great to begin with,” said Harmon, citing the long hours, difficulty of tasks, and toxic work environment that characterized Obama’s former position. “It was better than nothing, sure, but we’re talking about some really grueling and thankless work here.” Harmon added, “His position was emblematic of the kinds of high-stress, low-reward jobs that African Americans are often relegated to in our economy.” Because he obtained healthcare through his employer, Obama will now have to purchase insurance to cover his family’s medical expenses, which experts said is an option that will soon become exceedingly expensive if lawmakers vote to do away with the few affordable plans currently available to individual consumers. In another devastating blow, the family is reportedly expected to lose their home. “Even though everyone in the Obama family is out of a job, it sounds like they’re going to stick around the neighborhood and try to make things work,” Harmon said. “But it wouldn’t be surprising if we eventually see them wind up like millions of others, particularly fellow minorities, who find themselves in the same position: moving back to their hometown, where they have relatives and friends they can lean on.” “Regardless, the employment outlook isn’t bright for an older person of color with Obama’s work history,” he added. “At his age, someone like him might just while away his remaining years moving between various part-time positions and focusing on his own personal hobbies. It’s unlikely he’ll ever land a job as steady or as meaningful as the one he was just let go from. Unfortunately for him and so many others, that’s just the sad reality of the situation.” ",1,Black Man Out Of Work
"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Midway through a routine laboratory session Wednesday, sources say MIT graduate student Evan Ward casually remarked “What if we try this?” before making a small change to a robotic device that will one day eliminate 30 percent of the U.S. workforce. Ward’s off-the-cuff suggestion to slightly adjust a single component of the machine will reportedly result in nearly 50 million jobs being made expendable over the next two decades, wreaking havoc on the economy and giving rise to historic levels of unemployment that will persist for generations. “Maybe this will work,” the 24-year-old said out of mere curiosity, oblivious to the fact that the tiny modification he had suggested making to the actuator circuit of a robotic arm will result in America’s most vital industries laying off hundreds of thousands of workers every month. “I don’t know, though. I guess it doesn’t matter.” “What do you guys think?” he added. Current projections indicate the “little tweak,” which reportedly seemed so insignificant to Ward that he almost didn’t even bother mentioning it, will lead in time to the complete disappearance of millions of jobs in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, mining, construction, food processing, and telecommunications. Reports indicate that the grad student’s spontaneous suggestion involved adjusting the servo motor of an industrial robot by less than 3 millimeters, a modification that will forever change the lives of Americans as it renders hundreds of entire occupations obsolete and makes the existing skills and education of many workers all but useless in an utterly transformed economy. “It couldn’t hurt to try anyway,” Ward said of his idea, whose applications will drastically cut overhead for U.S. companies, lead to higher returns for shareholders, and cast thousands of the nation’s working- and middle-class communities into abject poverty. “What do we have to lose?” Ward’s spur-of-the-moment recommendation to alter the mechanism “just a smidge” will reportedly cause millions to lose their homes, become unable to support their families, and never again find work in their fields of expertise, events that sources say will result in the creation of a greatly expanded underclass that will remain a permanent feature of American society. “Let’s give it a shot,” said professor Barbara Simmons, who oversees the lab and who will eventually join the growing number of jobless Americans once her student’s innovation causes her engineering curriculum to become irrevocably outdated. “Hey, maybe we’ll learn something at least.” At press time, however, another student in the robotics lab had stumbled upon a groundbreaking technology that, before Ward’s discovery has a chance to devastate the economy, will inadvertently wipe out the entire human race.

"BOULDER, CO—A team of geologists from the University of Colorado announced at a press conference Wednesday that they had made a significant discovery concerning the world’s silt deposits, but stated that they understand if you aren’t interested in that sort of thing. The consortium of silt experts—who acknowledged that the analysis of the loose sedimentary material that gathers in lakes, rivers, and forests was not necessarily up everyone’s alley—nonetheless stressed that the results of their research had wide-reaching implications for those in their specific field of study. “We’ve made quite a substantial breakthrough in our understanding of how slope stability is impacted by the silt composition in different layers of alluvial soil, but, of course, I’m well aware that isn’t everybody’s thing,” said study director Stephen Powell, who admitted that investigating the movement of silt was, after all, a relatively niche field, so he certainly didn’t begrudge anyone who is not as excited as he is by such research. “If it piques your interest, that’s great. If it doesn’t, that’s no problem either. So, I’m just going to put our findings out there, and you can decide for yourself if this is something that you’d like to know more about: In some regions of northern Colorado, the silt fraction is actually dominated by coarse silt versus middle or fine silt.” “We were surprised and intrigued to learn that, and perhaps you are as well,” Powell continued. “That being said, if you don’t want to learn about silt, that’s perfectly reasonable too. Really, not a big deal to us.” With plans to publish the findings in the  , the scientists said that while their study had garnered a wealth of new information relevant to those who are passionate about topics like loess strata, clay content, and rock weathering, they would not blame anyone for deciding that dozens of pages about silt was much more than they would care to read. Citing their methodology, which included field mapping, drilling, and shear strength measurements, the research team suggested that perhaps the average person might at least appreciate the processes by which the data was collected. But they also raised the possibility that one may not have any special affinity for soil analysis at all and would prefer skipping the research altogether. The geologists added that either scenario was fine with them. “I’ve been a researcher and professor of sedimentary geology for the past 35 years at one of the region’s top public universities, so am I going to be thrilled when there’s a major development in the area of silt? You bet,” said Powell, speaking in front of a projection of the first slide of his team’s presentation, which read “The Mechanical Properties Of Quaternary Sediment And Their Impact On Slope Dynamics: Not For Everyone.” “That’s just who I am. I find the way silt forms on the earth’s surface fascinating. Silt erosion; silt lattices; the chemical breakdown of silt—these are all things I think about on a daily basis. When I attend conferences, I regularly speak on these matters and how they relate to the broader spectrum of soils in general. In other words, I like silt. However, our intention here isn’t to force anyone to share my enthusiasm about silt. Not in the least.” “After all, it’s silt,” he continued. “I get that.” Recognizing the lay reader’s possible hesitation, the scientists proposed that it might be worth just flipping through the report to see if anything catches their eye, adding that there was “actually some pretty interesting stuff in there” on how silt layers are deposited when subject to periglacial processes. Yet researchers were quick to note that if it sounded like they were trying to sell you on silt, that’s really not how it was meant to come across at all. “Let me say it as simply as I can: This is a discovery about a granular sediment whose primary audience is other academics in the field,” Powell said. “So, yes, I readily admit my excitement about verifying that the stability of slopes exceeding 27 degrees is controlled by five distinct phases of slope formation, each corresponding to a different sedimentary profile. But then again, silt research is of personal interest to me. No one’s holding your feet to the fire and saying you have to feel the same way I do about silt.” Added Powell, “On the other hand, though, we have a report about shale coming out next month that’s going to blow your goddamn mind.” ",1,Scientists Make Discovery About World’s Silt Deposits But Understand If You Aren’t Interested In That
"LONDON—Working from recently discovered ships’ logs and archaeological findings, a team of historians announced Monday they had pieced together a detailed account of the Carnival East India Company’s maiden cruise—the very first seafaring journey to the Far East dedicated solely to the enjoyment and entertainment of its passengers. According to records, the 175-foot, 1,400-ton sailing ship—christened the H.M.S.  —embarked from London in February 1605 on the first-ever “Expedition under-tak’n on behalfe of Plea-sure,” as it is referred to in writings from the time, with an itinerary that included stops in Ceylon, Malay, Nieuw-Guinea, and various tropical locales in the South China Sea.  “The Carnival East India Company was the first joint-stock cruise line to offer recreational voyages beyond the Cape of Good Hope and was widely popular among 17th-century English citizens for its all-inclusive packages that covered the costs of passengers’ lodging, meals, and leech treatments,” said Dr. Henry Carter, a leading maritime historian at Cambridge University who headed up the six-year investigation into the voyage after locating the company’s long-forgotten Royal Charter for the “Cultivation and Discoverance of all Manner of MARI-TIME LEISURE that GOD may deem Fit & Suitable” in the university’s archives. “The 110-week excursion offered people who could afford to let their fields lie fallow for two years a way to reduce the stress caused by a lifetime of toil and plague.” “Primary sources suggest that the one-third of passengers who were not taken captive by mercenaries or impressed into naval service had the time of their lives,” he added, “at least until they succumbed to dysentery.” Carter noted that newly unearthed sketches of the ship indicate that the H.M.S.   was outfitted with a variety of unique features, including long communal troughs of hardtack, gruel, and grog, which were available belowdecks at any time of day or night, and a large recreational wooden slide moistened with water pumped from the bilge. Additionally, broadsheet advertisements leading up to the cruise enticed passengers with the opportunity to “gorge upon the   of FOODE ’til one’s  , and thereupon LIE-ABOUT   and becomme redden’d unto the Duyvil Him-self in the  .” Beyond its promise of general leisure, the ship is known to have offered several scheduled entertainment options, the most popular of which was the nightly opportunity to have clergymen flagellate any passengers who believed they deserved punishment for their idleness, frivolity, or other mortal sins. In addition, it is believed that voyagers could disembark at various ports of call to gawk at “savages” and buy small satchels of spices, indigo dyes, jade, or opium. “Several surviving written accounts of the voyage mention that by far the most popular diversion on the H.M.S.   was a kindly Italian magician named Giuseppe who performed a simple cup-and-ball routine and was adored by the children on the ship,” Carter said. “In fact, many aboard expressed regret when, after roughly 48 hours at sea, Giuseppe was burned alive on the main deck by a mob of passengers who had charged him with the crime of witchcraft.” Much of what is known about the ship’s onboard amenities reportedly comes from a journal kept by Myhil Osborne, a member of England’s landed gentry who, at 41 years of age, was one of the ship’s few elderly passengers. In his writings, he raved about “lodgings of gen’rous measure” in which only 20 to 30 people were bunked in an 8-by-10-foot cabin, as opposed to the roughly 80 passengers housed in identically sized quarters in steerage. “I am a full Fort-night into my Sojourne, but only thryce yet have I beene poisen’d unto vomitous Bile and runny-ing Feculence by somme be-fouled Pottage or badly salt’d Meate,” Osborne wrote in praise of his experience aboard the H.M.S.  ’s maiden voyage. “Verily, not Two-Score Deathes have I witness’d of late, and those mere Cases of Scurvy, Drowning, Dæmon possession, Grippe, Mariner’s Palsy, or Childe-birth.” Subsequent Carnival East India cruises did not fare as well, according to researchers. Pirate attacks were reportedly common, as were wrecks in which all hands were lost, often when a ship attempted to anchor off dangerous reef-ringed coastlines in search of tax-free gold.  “At one point, the Carnival East India Company actually laid claim to an entire 2,400-acre island intended as a private retreat for its passengers,” said Carter, referring to a remote desert isle in a then-uncharted region off the coast of Siam. “However, years of cannibal attacks eventually forced the company to abandon it.” The wreck of the H.M.S.   now lies somewhere just east of the Seychelles, where historical accounts confirm it sank in 1613 after the ship’s crew mutinied and purposely capsized the vessel to avoid hearing another set by the ship’s dueling harpsichord players.

"BRUSSELS—Hailing the effort as their most promising confectionary-extraction project to date, Godiva executives held a press conference Wednesday to announce that one of their deep-sea rigs had successfully tapped the world’s largest known offshore ganache deposit.  According to the multinational chocolatier, its fixed platform rig Dark Decadence 7 has begun pumping ganache from deep below the ocean, having bored through the earth’s graham-cracker crust to access a 16-mile-wide undersea reservoir of the chocolaty glaze located off the coast of Belgium. “Sonar analysis confirms this previously untapped reserve contains approximately 800 billion morsels in total recoverable ganache, which would make it far larger than any other deposit yet discovered and almost twice as large as the Cocoa Sands of Western Canada,” said Godiva CEO Mohamed Elsarky, dismissing investors’ worries that surpluses of the rich, creamy filling could create a glut that wreaks havoc upon the international market for delectable treats. “As global demand increases, building up ganache stockpiles is the only way to stabilize truffle prices, particularly as developing countries continue to grow and invest heavily in dessert.” “Thanks to this new source, we believe the retail cost of cherry cordials could be kept as low as $5 per box throughout the holiday season,” Elsarky added. “This is encouraging news for the billions of sweet tooths worldwide who rely on this crucial substance every day.” According to Godiva, the deposit contains a light, sweet ganache suitable for infusion into milk chocolate medallions and Aztec Spice truffles. Company officials confirmed that tanker trucks will transport the crude candy to an inland refinery, where it will be stripped of any lingering almond or hazelnut impurities that it may have acquired from being pumped upward through thousands of feet of compressed nougat and marzipan layers. It will then reportedly be processed to anywhere from 55 to 90 percent dark for a variety of industrial applications, ranging from cake drizzling to strawberry dipping. The finished product will be shipped to North American markets aboard a fleet of chocolate supertankers that can hold up to 84 million bonbons’ worth of ganache, company officials said, and it will reach confectioners as far east as Moscow thanks to the recently reopened Trans-Eurasian Ganache Pipeline. Champions of opening up offshore deposits to drilling have argued it reduces the dependence of Western nations on foreign ganache, much of which comes from countries that have dubious human rights records and are controlled by corrupt leaders whose ruthless regimes and lavish lifestyles are bankrolled by massive ganache wealth. “With the tapping of this offshore ganache deposit, Godiva is also helping the industry move away from outdated practices such as fudge mining, which yields a much cruder, dirtier form of chocolate,” said Elsarky, who went on to cite well-documented worker safety hazards such as deadly fudge cave-ins and the slow-acting but often fatal cocoa lung. “Not only is deep-sea drilling safer than subterranean fudge mining and chocolate mountaintop removal, but it’s also more cost-effective, as it produces a consistently indulgent product with uniform cocoa butter crystals throughout.” Godiva, which paid a reported $15 million for its lease on the North Sea chocolate shelf, was quick to downplay criticisms of offshore drilling, a technique that carries with it the risk of deadly ganache rig explosions, as well as catastrophic icing slicks that often leave local marine life coated in thick, velvety-smooth layers of chocolate sauce.  “There is always a very slight possibility that a ganache well will blow out, but we at Godiva have worked tirelessly to ensure our industry never experiences another Ghirardelli Bittersweet disaster,” spokesperson Marta Willis said in reference to the 2008 chocolate spill that killed 16 and dumped more than 10 million tablespoons of raw cacao into the San Francisco Bay over the course of 73 days. “Our updated safety protocols include triple-sealed valves that prevent all dark and semisweet glazes from flowing out of the rig’s borehole to the surface.”  “And in the absolute worst-case scenario of a leak, we have the ability to cap our well with an airtight seal of macadamia clusters and caramel,” she added.  At press time, more than 300 top scientists had signed a letter condemning Godiva and advocating for alternative sweets, such as small handfuls of fruit and an occasional dash of cinnamon.

"INDIANAPOLIS—Solemnly declaring that he alone could enlighten a human race crippled by ignorance, area man Aaron Krause said Thursday that he had accepted the burden of being the only person on earth who actually understands the world and how it works. Krause, a 41-year-old sales manager and father of two, told reporters that his unequaled comprehension of politics, technology, popular culture, interpersonal relationships, food, sports, and all other existing subjects brings with it a heavy obligation to share all he knows with the countless individuals everywhere who remain totally in the dark. “Being the only one who knows everything isn’t an easy cross to bear, but simply put, I have a responsibility to tell people when they’re wrong,” said Krause, adding that despite an initial reluctance to impart his singular wisdom, he ultimately accepted it as his duty. “It’s not their fault, but I’m still going to correct them for their own benefit—maybe next time they’ll know the right way to run a meeting, lose weight, or listen to music.” “If I don’t help these people, who else can?” he added. Krause explained that he began to grasp the full scope of his burden after being repeatedly taken aback by the profound misunderstanding family and friends displayed about everything from selecting retirement savings accounts to disciplining children to properly grilling a steak. It was only after years of listening to people voice their shocking misconceptions about workplace etiquette, taxes, the relative merits of various makes and models of cars, and common grammar mistakes did Krause reportedly realize that he was the only living person endowed with such knowledge and that no one anywhere understood the world as unerringly as he did. According to Krause, his duty to enlighten the other 7.4 billion inhabitants of the planet follows him wherever he goes. Whether he is eating dinner at a restaurant with his family, walking through the breakroom at work, or spending time with friends, he told reporters that he must always be ready to rise to the occasion, imparting at a moment’s notice insights regarding what makes a good movie, whether a particular football player should be traded, or the superiority of certain rideshare apps over others. Conceding that his unmatched knowledge often makes it difficult to be patient with the uninformed multitudes, Krause added that he is frequently put in a position where he has no alternative but to interrupt a conversation among individuals he has never met. “I was at a party last week, and these people nearby obviously hadn’t the faintest notion of who made the best burger in town, so I had to spend an awful lot of time breaking it down for them,” Krause said, adding that he had similarly educated other guests at the same gathering on the best time to give children their own smartphone and the appropriate method for battling international terrorism. “And it’s even harder when I go on social media. There, I’m just bombarded with people who are completely mistaken about everything, and it feels like I’ll never get to everyone who needs my help.” “But I have to try,” he added. “This is the weight I carry.” Well aware that he had no choice but to speak up, Krause was at press time explaining to a stranger that the book she was reading wasn’t nearly as good as several others on the topic.

"GREENVILLE, SC—After 36 hours on the run through the woodlands of South Carolina, a bloodied and exhausted Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) reportedly cowered behind the trunk of a willow tree Wednesday as President Donald Trump’s vicious hunting dogs closed in on him. According to sources, Graham has spent the past day and night wading across frigid creeks, slogging into fetid swampland, and crashing through thickets of thorny brambles in an effort to evade Trump’s pack of hounds, but he has not been able to shake the president’s determined hunting party. “Please, God, let me make it out of here alive,” the 61-year-old senator whispered to himself, trying to quiet his ragged breathing as the animals frantically searched the ground just above the hollow where he lay hiding. “Please.” “If I can just make it to Virginia, [former Rep.] Scott [Rigell] will help me—he has to,” added Graham, apparently unaware the same dogs had ripped the recently retired Republican congressman to pieces a few days prior in reprisal for calling Trump a “con man” during the presidential campaign. Local sources said the chase began early yesterday after Graham was tipped off that Trump was approaching his Greenville congressional offices with a retinue of valets, who were seen struggling to control two dozen baying foxhounds as they strained at their leads in a frenzied bloodlust. Trump’s dog handlers reportedly rubbed a necktie belonging to Graham under the animals’ noses, with one of the valets commenting that the dogs were particularly agitated, having already “gotten the taste of blood from Jeb.” After bolting for the nearby woods, Graham was said to have evaded Trump’s dogs for several hours by slicing open his own hand with a sharp rock, smearing his blood on a tree, and scrambling up an embankment in the opposite direction to throw the animals off his trail. However, reports suggest the hounds were able to pick up Graham’s scent again after discovering a torn piece of the senator’s suit pants on a shrub into which he fell after tripping over a tree root and badly twisting his ankle. Now hobbled, Graham is believed to have spent several freezing hours sleeping fitfully under a rocky overhang, only to be awakened by the sound of the dogs’ sudden approach. Sources confirmed the senator has not been able to escape the range of Trump’s retinue since that time, and has begun to see flashes of the commander-in-chief’s red field jacket between the trees as the sound of his hunting horn comes ever closer. “I said I’d vote to confirm [Secretary of State nominee] Rex Tillerson!” Graham shouted into the woodland shadows as he tried to hide his figure behind the tree trunk. “I gave you that! What else do you want from me, you bastard?” At press time, Trump’s dogs were reportedly charging toward Graham, who, standing at the crest of a waterfall and seeing no better option, leapt into the deadly rapids hundreds of feet below.

"ATLANTA—As part of its ongoing campaign to combat the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out a new fleet of Narcan-equipped biplanes Monday to fumigate opioid-ravaged small towns nationwide. “It’s become obvious that half measures will not remedy this crisis, so the next step is for CDC aircraft to spray communities decimated by addiction with atomized opioid blockers,” said acting CDC director Anne Schuchat, adding that every one of the Boeing-Stearman Model 75 biplanes purchased by the agency has been retrofitted with 800-gallon aerosol canisters capable of dispersing enough Narcan to restart the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the United States roughly 28 times. “We’ll be dropping Narcan over residential neighborhoods, parks, alleyways, schools—any conceivable place where opioid abuse or overdose may occur. Our goal is to run these biplanes continuously, replenishing fuel and Narcan midair when possible. Hopefully, this will enable us to administer aerial applications of the opiate antidote every few minutes.” At press time, CDC officials were troubled by incoming reports that millions of citizens across the nation had already become addicted to the gas.

"WASHINGTON—Shaking himself back to consciousness and cardiopulmonary function following a momentary lapse in personal viability, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross apologized to the other cabinet members after briefly dying during a meeting on steel tariffs Friday. “Whoops, sorry about that—just walked towards the light for a second,” said Ross, blinking rapidly as his neurons resumed firing and his soul settled back into its vessel of flesh following his latest brush with eternity. “Sorry, folks, all brain function just sort of ceased there and I briefly beheld the sight of my dead loved ones beckoning to me from the far side of the gate to the night country. What’d I miss?” Sources confirmed that Ross’ colleagues have previously expressed their annoyance at the secretary’s brushes with mortality, claiming they find themselves distracted by his loud and frequent death rattles.

"ATLANTA—Urging Americans to help prevent the overall yucky feeling from continuing to spread unchecked, the CDC issued a warning Thursday of a full-blown epidemic of the blahs. “We urge you to seek medical attention the second you start to experience ickiness or feel sorta meh,” said CDC director Brenda Fitzgerald, explaining that, to be treated, this rapidly accelerating strain of the blahs must be caught before the “you’re, like, ‘ugh’ stage.” “Take heed of the common warning signs, such as feeling all-around kinda gross or having a day where you’re just in some kind of funk. Otherwise, the blahs can worsen into a general sense of cruddiness or suddenly getting all sad, which, of course, is far more difficult to address.” At press time, the CDC had ordered a quarantine of 43 million Americans who reported one of those things where you just want to go home, get in bed, and not really do anything.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to provide students with at least a modicum of supervision in the afternoon, the Department of Education on Monday announced a new nationwide after-school program specifically aimed at keeping children off the streets for an additional 45 minutes. “This initiative will offer a safe environment for not quite an hour to children who do not immediately have access to a parent or guardian once classes let out,” said Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, adding that a broad range of activities will be used to keep children engaged for exactly 45 minutes, after which they will be turned loose to roam completely unattended. “By delaying for a bit whatever dangers await the children off school grounds, this program will give concerned parents the temporary peace of mind that comes with knowing exactly where their kids are for a few more minutes each day.” At press time, funding cuts had resulted in the program being reduced to three days a week for 20 minutes, with an adult actually being present for only half that time.

"WASHINGTON—In an attempt to ensure the federal benefit program is not taken advantage of, a new regulation announced Tuesday will require all organisms facing extinction to actively search for a new habitat in order to receive funding for their protection under the Endangered Species Act. “Effective immediately, America’s at-risk species must prove they are making an effort to find a different ecosystem to live in if they wish to obtain government assistance for their continued survival,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, adding that endangered creatures such as the black-footed ferret and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep should not be allowed to just sit back and live on public lands at taxpayer expense unless they agree to take steps to better their own situations. “An ‘endangered’ status isn’t a free pass, and it’s important we put forth policies that encourage a culture of personal responsibility among our nation’s plants and animals. We’re not doing the star cactus or the salt marsh harvest mouse any favors when we allow them to live on the government’s dime, which can create a disincentive for them to secure a place in another habitat and become self-sufficient.” At press time, the Department of the Interior announced further regulations capping the amount of time a species can remain on the endangered list at six months.

"SILVER SPRING, MD—Following months of research into the psychedelic compound’s effects, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed Thursday that psilocybin could significantly reduce the risk of mindlessly following society’s rules like a fucking lemming. “After numerous clinical trials, we can state with a high degree of certainty that ingesting small doses of psilocybin greatly decreases the chances of blindly marching in lockstep like a bunch of goddamn sheep being led to the slaughter,” said FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb, noting that brain-scan data collected from a double-blind study indicated that a 3.5-gram dosage of psilocybin could greatly enhance the probability of busting open the doors of perception and freeing users from their mind-prisons. “We found that study participants were far more likely than the general public to cut the marionette strings that had been controlling them their entire shitty lives. In addition, test subjects also entered a heightened state of awareness of the fact that the entire social order is a sick fucking joke perpetrated by the man.” Gottlieb cautioned that not all the results were as positive, however, noting that many users experienced a deep depression resulting from watching the masses sleepwalk through life like pathetic automatons.  ",1,FDA Confirms Psilocybin Reduces Risk Of Mindlessly Following Society’s Rules Like Fucking Lemming
"WASHINGTON—Noting that millions have already fallen victim to the long-running grift, the FBI warned Monday of the ‘American Dream’ scam. “Reports are coming in all across the country of Americans who were promised great prosperity and success in exchange for a lifetime of hard work, only to find themselves swindled and left with virtually nothing,” said agent Dean Winthrop, who explained that susceptible parties are made to believe that class mobility is possible simply through ability or achievement, despite the fact that innumerable social, economic, and racial barriers prevent the vast majority of U.S. citizens from attaining even marginal amounts of upward movement. “Many even travelled across the world to live in what they were calling ‘The Land Of Opportunity,’ a fictitious meritocratic society where any person can simply work their way up from the bottom. The victims, it appears, were drawn in by wild promises about equitable access to wealth, education, and home ownership, but before they knew it, they got played for suckers.” Winthrop added that they haven’t identified the scheme’s kingpin, but are investigating a number of upper-middle class white men who have suspiciously benefitted from the longtime scam.

"WASHINGTON—Following backlash over the agency’s plan to scrap rules ensuring that service providers treat all internet data the same, FCC Chair Ajit Pai unveiled on Monday a premium comment line to fast-track net neutrality complaints, which may be purchased for $49.99 per month. “We hear everyone’s concerns loud and clear, and we are now offering Americans expedited access to the FCC office for less than 50 dollars a month,” said Pai, adding that, for an additional $14.99, users may upgrade to Complaint Line Plus and speak to an actual representative instead of leaving a voicemail message on the FCC’s automated system. “Other premium plans will allow citizens to sound off about the repeal of net neutrality with limited or even no interruptions from ads.” At press time, telecommunications giant Comcast had slowed down the FCC’s complaint line considerably, driving millions of Americans to the FCC complaint line it ran itself.

"BURBANK, CA—Revealing that it was the provision that essentially sealed the multi-billion dollar deal, sources reported Thursday that Disney Company CEO Bob Iger offered Rupert Murdoch one night with Mickey Mouse in exchange for 21st Century Fox. “To help sweeten our $52.4 billion proposal, we offered Mr. Murdoch access to Mickey for a single-night encounter, which he eagerly accepted,” said Iger, explaining that after signing the deal, Murdoch was given the keys to a penthouse suite at the Hotel Bel Air, where he would find two complimentary bottles of Krug Champagne and a fully disrobed Mickey Mouse waiting for him. “Mr. Murdoch was very amenable to our overtures. He even offered to cut the sale price in half for an entire week of companionship, but we are steadfast in protecting the exclusivity of Mickey’s attention.” Iger went on to say that it was far easier to negotiate this deal than the one struck for Lucasfilm, for which George Lucas demanded an evening with all seven dwarfs.

"ORLANDO, FL—Increasingly dubious that their lodging was in any way tied to the theme park experience, Larry Kostyk’s two children on Wednesday were reportedly starting to see through their father’s claim that the DoubleTree Hotel was part of the Walt Disney World Resort. “I dunno, we’re like half an hour away from the park, and this whole hotel seems like it could be pretty much anywhere,” said son Michael Kostyk, 12, adding that except for a few pamphlets he found for the Magic Kingdom in a lobby rack, there was no discernable Disney presence whatsoever. “Dad said the bus we got from the airport was a special Disney resort bus, but it stopped at a Residence Inn and a Best Western before it got to our hotel. And when I look out our room’s window, I can’t see Cinderella’s Castle or the Epcot ball. I think there’s a Lowe’s or something.” At press time, while his children’s backs were turned, Kostyk was hastily arranging silver dollar breakfast buffet pancakes to resemble a mouse.

"BURBANK, CA—Hinting that the gritty new animated feature would close the book on a “beloved friend,” a new Disney trailer on Monday teased the exit of a major character in the upcoming film  . “Fans of the franchise should brace themselves, because   might just be the last time they ever see one of their favorite characters in the Hundred Acre Wood,” said Disney spokesperson Sarah Freeborn, alluding to the preview’s opening shot showing Pooh jerking his head up after hearing a gunshot off in the distance and saying “Oh, bother.” “As suggested by the minor-key score and drab black-and-gray color palette of the trailer, tragedy is coming for Christopher Robin and his friends, all of whom will be stripped of their innocence in a single brutal act.” At press time, the official poster was released, featuring driving rain lashing a honey pot turned on its side in a mud puddle and the tagline “Winter 2017.” ",1,Disney Trailer Teases Exit Of Major Character In Upcoming Film ‘Death At Pooh Corner’
"SAN FRANCISCO—In an effort to stop the spread of the dangerous negativity as quickly as possible, agents from the Department of Labor’s Emergency Response Team on Friday reportedly sealed off the toxic workplace environment at tech incubator Molloy Capital. “We’ve begun the hazardous but absolutely necessary task of cleaning up the site’s dangerous backbiting, unwanted sexual advances, and gross managerial incompetence,” said Labor Department special agent Angela Lasker, who noted that prior to their arrival, a steady stream of inappropriate comments had been seeping into the water-cooler conversation and were threatening to poison the entire company-wide intranet. “While we believe we’ve contained most of the professional and psychological damage, it’s still a very hostile, unsafe area. We honestly don’t think it will be able to sustain new hires for the foreseeable future, or at least until the pervasive low morale has had a chance to dissipate.” Lasker went on to say, however, that the communications department would likely never again be suitable for human employment.

"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to better reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of their audience, Disney officials this week introduced Lily of Hazelberry, the company’s first virgin princess. “While our fans have long been enchanted by Belle, Ariel, and Elsa, we wanted to create a relatable princess for girls everywhere who are still virgins,” said Disney executive vice president Zenia Mucha, describing the only Disney princess who has never had sexual intercourse as a quirky, confident, and pure 14-year-old ascendant to the throne of the magical kingdom of Hazelberry. “All Disney princesses have extraordinary stories and inner qualities that make them wonderful and unique, but we’ve always lacked a heroine who hasn’t yet slept with her boyfriend or another male character. We are proud that Lily will finally provide a princess to look up to for the large demographic of young girls who, due to age, choice, or unavailability of sexual partners, have not yet experienced intercourse.” Disney representatives added that sexually active girls would also love Lily’s best friend, Princess Misty, who lives in a neighboring enchanted realm and just moved in with her slightly older boyfriend, Clint.

"BAY LAKE, FL—In an effort to provide park visitors with the most true-to-life attraction possible, Walt Disney World officials announced Monday that computer technicians have begun uploading Barack Obama’s consciousness into his animatronic robot likeness at the Magic Kingdom’s Hall of Presidents exhibit. “Everything is going very smoothly so far; we’ve already transferred roughly 30 percent of the president’s memories, cognitive capacities, and emotional traits to the robot avatar,” said head curator Tim Samuelson, who confirmed the process would take up to 19 separate four-hour sessions before Obama’s complete being was transmitted to the mechanized figure, which would reportedly draw on the president’s essential nature as it delivered the same 90-second remarks during each performance of the exhibit’s 20-minute show. “Of course, President Obama will be rendered mentally barren and functionally incapacitated at the moment the consciousness transfer is complete, but his message of national unity and his extraordinary legacy as our first African-American president will live on forever inside his animatronic counterpart, which will be able to use its five mechanical points of articulation and will be able to say ‘Hello, I’m the 44th president of the United States’ and several other phrases with the exact same bearing and assurance as Obama himself.” Samuelson assured reporters that improvements to the upload process will prevent the Obama robot from slowly becoming deranged and then killing dozens of park visitors after mistaking them for Native Americans, as tragically occurred in 1974 with the park’s Andrew Jackson.

"ORLANDO, FL—Saying they were working diligently to address the problem, Walt Disney World officials acknowledged Wednesday that several dozen unauthorized characters, none of which have ever appeared in a Disney film or cartoon, had been found in recent weeks wandering throughout the theme park. Company sources confirmed that at least 60 separate individuals in costumes, including various woodland creatures, several fairies, and what officials described as a walrus in a lab coat, have been spotted greeting visitors, hugging children, posing for pictures, and meandering into daily parades alongside sanctioned Disney characters. “I want to assure Disney World visitors that these unaffiliated characters are being rounded up as we speak and removed from the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney’s Hollywood Studios,” said company spokesperson Wesley Aldridge, noting that patrons may still encounter certain individuals wearing ox costumes, Belgian peasant girl costumes, or any number of other unfamiliar outfits for the time being. “However, before approaching any costumed individual in our park, you should ask yourself whether you recognize this character from an officially licensed product in the Disney or Pixar catalog. If not, please let security know immediately.” “If you are taking your picture with Chompers the Iguana, for example, you are not taking a picture with an official Disney character,” Aldridge continued. “That’s just a man in an iguana suit. That man does not work for Disney. He doesn’t belong here.” Aldridge emphasized that none of the non-Disney-brand characters appeared intent on causing any harm and noted with astonishment that not a single one had been found charging money for photographs, concluding that such individuals seemed to “just enjoy being at the park.” Indeed, officials speculate that each offender pays full price for a ticket, enters with their costume stowed in a bag, changes in a Disney restroom, and then emerges to greet crowds or perform short dance routines they have prepared themselves. While security reportedly kicks out an average of 20 unauthorized characters each day from the theme park and Disney Family Breakfasts at onsite hotel properties, sources stated that nearly all return to the premises. Disney workers claimed that some reenter park property within just hours of their expulsion, citing in particular a muskrat named King Stumpy as well as a boisterous prospector character calling himself Grandpappy Gizzards, who has been forcibly removed from Frontierland every day since mid-February. “My daughter and I spent 45 minutes in line waiting to meet someone named Princess Maureen,” said 34-year-old Faith Gosselin of Nashua, NH, one of many visitors reportedly duped by the 15 or so unlicensed Disney princesses and emperors that park officials allege are wandering Fantasyland at any given time. “She told my daughter she came all the way from the Diamondonia Kingdom on her flying shark to meet us. It didn’t make any sense, but I just figured she was from a new movie or something.” “But then I saw Captain Hook come up to her and tell her really sternly that she needed to leave,” Gosselin added. “He was pretty mad.” In an effort to appear more genuine to park patrons, sources reported that many of the unsanctioned characters have developed their own intricate mythologies and unique, non-Disney-affiliated catchphrases such as “Jumpin’ juniper” or “Wowie-kazaam!” “There was this squirrel over by Splash Mountain who said he was one of the Scurry Brothers and asked if we’d been on his ride called the Admiral Acorn Adventure,” said father of two Troy Milizia from Auburn, NY. “When we said we hadn’t, he brought out a mountain bike with a little wagon chained behind it and asked us to hop in. He told us it was just like the scene from his movie where he travels down the mountain pass in search of acorns.” “The kids loved it, but I had no idea what he was talking about,” Milizia continued. “Once he stopped pedaling and asked us if we wanted to go again, I just grabbed my girls and got out of there.” While Disney officials reiterated that most fraudulent characters posed no threat, they singled out a possum with a cane and top hat as particularly troublesome, noting that the ornery character is often seen sitting on the Main Street, U.S.A. curb and is known to go by the names “Portly Possum,” “Prickly Possum,” “Patty O’Possum,” “Possum Pete,” or “Pop-Pop Possum.” “There has never been a Disney film that has featured a possum, and we would like to make it abundantly clear to visitors that no licensed Disney character will ever chew tobacco or wear an orthopedic back brace on the job,” said Aldridge, holding a photograph of the counterfeit character. “And we urge you not to purchase the   DVD he’s selling out of his backpack. It’s really very bad.” ",1,Disney Finds Dozens Of Unauthorized Characters Appearing Illegally Inside Theme Park
"ORLANDO, FL—Explaining that the decision was deemed necessary to protect the health and safety of park patrons, officials at Disney World announced Wednesday that they had been forced to euthanize a character that attacked a visitor over the weekend. “Obviously, this was an unfortunate situation, and we do everything possible to prevent such incidents; however, our policy clearly states that when a character threatens or injures a guest, we have no choice but to put him or her down,” Disney World spokesman Don Milhiser said of the encounter in which the Dale character in the Frontierland portion of the park became defensive during a meet-and-greet and viciously clawed a 9-year-old visitor. “He’s very protective of Chip, and we think the girl just approached a little too quickly for a photo. We considered relocating Dale to a different section of the park, but we couldn’t risk this happening with another guest, especially in light of last year’s Eeyore incident.” Disney World officials closed their press conference by reminding visitors to avoid any sudden movements, maintain their distance, and refrain from making direct eye contact with any of the characters.

"BAY LAKE, FL—Citing the 75 percent increase in ticket prices over the past decade, a report published Thursday by consumer research firm McGann & Associates found that the rising cost of admission to Walt Disney World is prompting more parents to leave their children at home when visiting the popular resort. According to the study, while real wages in the U.S. have remained stagnant over the past 30 years, the price of a one-day theme park pass has increased fivefold, a development that is forcing many mothers and fathers to drop off their kids with relatives or family friends before traveling by themselves to patronize the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, or any of Disney World’s other properties. “For most U.S. households, the previously common practice of taking the whole family for a long weekend to Disney World is now simply out of reach, leaving parents with no choice but to go to the park on their own,” said the report’s author, Marie Dolan, who added that the average family simply does not have enough in savings to buy more than two tickets at their current cost of $105 apiece, a price that she was quick to point out did not even include a water park add-on option. “A family earning the national average could at one time afford not only tickets, but also three nights in an onsite Disney hotel. But now, principal wage-earners must make tough sacrifices, which usually means leaving the young ones behind while Mom and Dad go off to ride all the rides and visit with all the Disney characters.” “Nowadays, if you look around Disney World, it’s mostly just mothers and fathers who are waiting in lines for the attractions or taking one another’s photos in front of the Haunted Mansion,” Dolan added. Even for parents who try to cut costs by purchasing five-day value passes or restricting their visits to just Disney’s Hollywood Studios or Animal Kingdom, the resulting savings reportedly aren’t enough to allow them to bring the entire family along. In the best-case scenarios, Dolan conceded that a couple could theoretically be able to scrimp sufficiently to take just one of their children, provided his or her siblings were left with a caretaker who could look after them free of charge. “I have so many great memories from when my own parents brought me and my brothers here, and we all rode Space Mountain and watched the Country Bear Jamboree together—but my wife, Danielle, and I just didn’t have enough money to bring our own daughters,” said resort guest and father of two Paul Gomez, 36, speaking to reporters while holding a Mickey Mouse–shaped ice cream bar and wearing the park’s iconic mouse ears hat. “I wanted more than anything to give our kids the same amazing experience I had, but with all our bills and mortgage payments, we could only cover a pair of airline tickets and park passes. I know my girls would have loved going on Splash Mountain, getting off the ride, and then rushing to get back in line with us today.” “Maybe things will turn around in a few years and we’ll be able to bring [Gomez’s daughters] Zadie and Erika, but until then it’s going to be just me and my wife at the character breakfast with Belle and the Beast,” Gomez added. Numerous other parents, including Jessica and Raymond Huebel of Provo, UT, said they had hoped to give their children at least a glimpse of the fun they were having at Disney World by bringing home a set of high-quality pictures, but expressed dismay that they weren’t able to cover even the most modest Memory Maker photo packages the park offers. According to the Huebels, their tight budget only allowed them to purchase a single 11-by-14-inch glossy photo of the two of them riding Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin, which they said they intended to hang in their own master bedroom. “Just walking up Main Street, U.S.A. and seeing Cinderella’s Castle in the distance—I would have loved to turn to my son at that moment and see him smile,” said Jessica Huebel shortly after hugging both Chip and Dale in Frontierland. “But my husband says we’ll barely have enough gas money for the trip home as it is.” “I just hope prices don’t keep going up too much,” she added. “Otherwise, during the next visit I’ll probably be riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad by myself.” ",1,Report: Rising Disney World Ticket Costs Prompting Many Parents To Leave Children At Home
"ORLANDO, FL—Beseeching those individuals remaining on the premises Wednesday to relocate before Hurricane Irma strikes, local officials reportedly drove down Disney World’s Main Street, USA, using vehicle-mounted loudspeakers to plead with any holdout characters to evacuate. “We urge everyone to leave Liberty Square and seek out higher ground immediately as we may not be able to reach you if the Rivers of America flood,” said Orange County sheriff Jason Levine through his megaphone as he pulled up alongside a resolute Jiminy Cricket and Buzz Lightyear, who were seen ignoring the warning and continuing to hammer plywood onto the windows of Cinderella’s Castle, just two of the several dozen characters who had reportedly decided to hole up throughout the theme park with stockpiles of turkey legs and mouse-ear-shaped ice cream bars in an attempt to ride out the Category 5 storm. “Please leave any glass slippers, sorcerer’s hats, and other belongings behind and exit in a quick and orderly fashion. This is for your own safety. Monorails are waiting to evacuate you and your loved ones.” When later contacted by police officers going door to door, local dwarf Grumpy told authorities that he and his many relations had lived in Fantasyland for 45 years and were at peace riding out the storm in their small cottage, regardless of what fate awaited them.

"WASHINGTON—Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. President-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. “Honestly, I’m in shock—I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president,” said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office “sent chills down [his] spine.” “Frankly, I never thought I’d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.” “It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,” he continued. Trump’s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation’s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. Perhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump’s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. “Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,” said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. “There’s no way he’s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He’s proud to be a black-hearted man because that’s exactly who he is.” “And that won’t change just because he’s the president,” she added. While no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. Reflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump’s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. “Oh my God, he actually won!” said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. “This really happened. It’s just starting to sink in.” “Nothing is going to be the same after this election,” he added. “Nothing.” ",1,Nation Elects First Black-Hearted President
"BAY LAKE, FL—Touting the new property’s wide variety of unique and imaginative attractions, representatives from the Walt Disney World Resort announced Monday the opening of Ordeal Kingdom, a new theme park specifically designed for full-scale family meltdowns. Situated between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, the 350-acre property reportedly incorporates many of the most aggravating elements of Disney’s other parks and expands them into a creative and fully immersive world of irritation, which is said to include the longest lines in the entire resort, a convoluted layout that is only depicted in indecipherable cartoon maps that are not to scale, and 150 percent higher prices. According to park director Jacob Bartlett, Ordeal Kingdom’s specialized combination of features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting families, eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst followed by a silent walk back to the car. “We’ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids have the heated argument of a lifetime,” said Bartlett, explaining that the park was split into five themed “lands,” including Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon, each of which can be reached by Mickey’s Congestion Junction Railway. “Whether it’s the sheer distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations, every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and saying you should never have come in the first place.” “No trip to Disney is complete without everyone in your party losing all emotional self-control,” Bartlett continued. “And at Ordeal Kingdom, we promise that all your wildest family blowups will come to life!” According to Bartlett, considerable effort was devoted to crafting the park’s overall aesthetic, which emphasizes open, unshaded stretches of asphalt without any benches for resting. Additionally, no lockers have been provided anywhere on the grounds, encouraging guests to carry their bags and souvenirs around with them all day, often over stretches of quaint, uneven cobblestone. Bartlett went on to add that the Disney FastPass service will be available in the new park, giving irritable visitors the opportunity to squabble over whether they wasted their no-wait ride selection too early in the day. One of Ordeal Kingdom’s most popular attractions is expected to be Tarzan Adventure, a kid-friendly obstacle course that provides dozens of opportunities for parents to lose track of their children among twists and turns as they struggle to make their voices heard over loud jungle sound effects. Park officials explained that the design is intended to sow seeds of resentment toward whichever parent insisted that the attraction’s deliberately vague age requirements could be ignored, contributing to the eventual fiery altercation that officials expect to boil over at an understocked gift shop or a snack stand selling $11 soft pretzels. “We provide the rides, games, and entertainment, and you do the rest—whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you’re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8-year-old son an ungrateful little shit, Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds,” said Bartlett, raising his voice over the park’s theme song, which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property. “Who knows? Maybe   family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park, right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter’s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you.” Officials noted that Ordeal Kingdom also features live shows on five different stages, each one tailored to appeal exclusively to one gender and age group, with all shows occurring simultaneously once per day during lunchtime. In addition, the property hosts a number of three-hour-long parades throughout the day that can be viewed from designated obstructed viewpoints. Furthermore, sources confirmed that numerous Disney characters, all from the 1985 movie  , would be wandering the park for visitors to meet and take photos with. “We want your family to have a one-of-a-kind experience while you’re here, which is why Disney employees will be on hand throughout the park to wish you ‘a magical day,’” said Bartlett, referring to the greeting that will begin to sound more and more like a taunt as the afternoon wears on. “Plus, as one final treat, you’ll find the parking lots completely unmarked, providing one last special opportunity for family members to cry, yell, and pitch a hysterical fit—regardless of how young or old they are—when it takes more than an hour to find the car!” Added Bartlett, “Our goal is to leave every one of our guests with memories that will last a lifetime.” ",1,Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns

"LOS ANGELES—In a development that stunned studio executives, the new Disney motion picture   somehow flopped at the box office over its opening weekend despite a   of star Armie Hammer in   magazine. “We’re totally in disbelief over the way the movie has underperformed—people saw the half-page interview with Armie Hammer in  , right?” Disney Executive Vice President of Worldwide Distribution Dave Hollis said of the 153-word article titled   which mentions that the actor’s wife, Elizabeth, doesn’t like cold baths and that the couple does not keep secrets from each other. “It’s extremely frustrating when you have a film that has everything going for it—big-name stars, a $175 million marketing budget, a sidebar interview with Armie Hammer in   magazine—and it’s still not enough. I mean, what more could we have done?” At press time, the film’s profits had reportedly picked up dramatically after Hammer sat down with   to talk about what it was like riding a horse.

"LOS ANGELES—Upon emerging from an advance screening of the Walt Disney Pictures film  , representatives of the country’s American Indian population enthusiastically praised the action-adventure comedy Wednesday, telling reporters that they were thrilled to finally see a movie that does justice to the stirring history of the nation’s native peoples. “At long last, we have a tale befitting the long, proud tradition of our tribespeople,” said Douglas Walking Bear Akando, 94, a Potawatomi tribe elder who claimed he was moved to tears by lead actor Johnny Depp’s stoic, thoroughly researched portrayal of the spirit warrior Tonto in the upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer production. “For all of Hollywood’s failed attempts to create something that accurately recounts our glorious past while also honoring the bravery and wisdom of our ancestors,   does just that. And on July 3, the American people will finally know our story.” At press time, a coalition representing the nation’s estimated 3 million American Indians had released a statement completely forgiving the United States for its systematic butchery and subsequent confinement of their people, saying that the new Lone Ranger movie “had made it all worth it.” ",1,Ecstatic American Indians Praise 'The Lone Ranger'
"WASHINGTON—In the wake of the release of a letter implicating the Supreme Court nominee in a sexual assault, Senate Republicans told reporters Monday that they would seek to delay a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation until his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, was properly smeared. “Given the significance of this vote and the accusations at hand, it’s of the utmost importance that we give ourselves the time to carefully drag Miss Ford’s name through the mud and make her regret ever coming forth with these accounts,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), stressing that he would urge his colleagues to push back any vote on the nomination until the Senate Judiciary Committee had taken every opportunity to tear apart Ford’s character on a national stage, question her mental stability, and repeatedly trivialize her experience of sexual trauma. “We can’t in good conscience confirm Judge Kavanaugh—to the highest court in the land, mind you—without making a serious attempt to find evidence from the accuser’s life suggesting she’s nothing more than a serial liar and attention seeker. If not just to slander her name, than at least to invalidate the experiences of every sexual assault victim in the country.” McConnell stressed that he understood the need for swiftness in the matter, as the Senate would absolutely confirm Kavanaugh regardless of any findings.

"BOULDER, CO—Saying such feelings of desire were observed in nearly every individual they studied, psychologists from the University of Colorado released a report Thursday concluding that it is perfectly natural for people to fantasize about sandwiches other than the one presently in their hands. The study, which surveyed more than 500 adults from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, determined that 89 percent of subjects had, at least once during the previous six months, vividly imagined a different sandwich while sitting down at the table with their current hero, hoagie, or po’ boy. “While many people may find it distressing or shameful when they begin mentally picturing a sandwich that’s nothing like the one they are holding, our findings suggest that these thoughts are, in fact, a completely normal biological impulse,” said Dr. Kelly Sohn, the report’s lead author. “You should by no means feel any sense of regret or embarrassment if you suddenly find yourself mid-bite feeling curious about a particularly striking BLT that caught your eye while you were walking by a café earlier that day or letting your thoughts drift to a pastrami on rye you used to have in college.” “Even if you’re completely satisfied with the sandwich sitting right in front of you, it is purely an instinctual response to become overwhelmed by a strong desire to taste one that’s very different,” Sohn added. “It’s just human nature.” According to the research team, it is particularly common for individuals to indulge in fantasies about exotic sandwiches from foreign culinary traditions, like Cubans or Vietnamese bánh mìs, that they have never tried before. Additionally, Sohn said that many subjects reported finding themselves particularly drawn to bigger, beefier sandwiches or those with larger meatballs, often causing them to imagine these alluring features on their own, plainer sandwich when they later sit down for a meal. Researchers also explained that, on average, a person imagines a different sandwich than the one they’re currently holding about once every week, though a sizable minority of respondents reportedly acknowledged engaging in such fantasies every single time they had lunch. “It’s important to remember that mentally picturing a piled-high Reuben when you’re eating the same chicken salad sandwich you always get is by and large the product of reflexive brain activity over which you have very little control,” said Sohn, adding that Americans are constantly bombarded with images of picture-perfect subs and idealized pulled pork sandwiches on billboards and television, further explaining the ubiquity of the phenomenon. “In fact, we found that when people are able to unlearn the guilt that is often associated with these harmless fantasies, it can actually make the enjoyment of one’s own sandwich that much more satisfying.” “The real danger lies in unnecessarily punishing oneself for these thoughts, which can eventually diminish the gratification one derives from eating sandwiches altogether,” she continued. Sohn further assured the public that it was normal for such fantasies to become extremely vivid and complex. In particular, she noted that 63 percent of subjects had reported that on one or more occasions, they had imagined themselves eating their desired sandwich in an uncommon location, such as in a car, aboard a plane, or even in front of other people in public. Experts also confirmed that more atypical fantasies, such as eating a sandwich in a hot tub or devouring two sandwiches at once, were, in most cases, perfectly normal as well. “It’s such a relief to know I’m not some weirdo or a bad person for checking out my brother’s spicy Italian when we went out to lunch a few weeks ago—I felt so guilty about that,” said 42-year-old study participant Craig Worsley, who told reporters he couldn’t help but imagine sinking his teeth into the sandwich’s thick layers of salami, capicola, and provolone until tangy vinaigrette dribbled all down his chin. “Don’t get me wrong, I liked the patty melt I ordered just fine, but man, I looked at his sandwich and couldn’t help but think, ‘Damn, that thing is stacked.’” Added Worsley, “But now I understand I’m just like any other person out there with a normal, healthy appetite.” Researchers stated that a small percentage of deeply troubled individuals reported fantasizing about salads while eating their sandwiches, and recommended that anyone experiencing these types of perverse, abnormal thoughts immediately seek psychological counseling.

"EL PASO, TX—Saying they were forced to use lethal force after the statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder attempted to breach a secure checkpoint, United States Border Patrol agents confirmed Friday that Nate Silver was gunned down while trying to cross into Mexico with all the polling data from the 2016 general election. A government spokesperson stated that the 38-year-old political blogger, who presented a patrolman at the border crossing with a doctored U.S. passport listing his name as Rafael Ignacio Salvador, reportedly appeared agitated and nervous when responding to simple questions, resulting in his being flagged for further screening and apparently prompting his decision to flee. Silver is said to have rammed his vehicle into a patrol car during his attempt to evade authorities before trying to escape on foot with as many national and state-level opinion polls as he could carry, at which time he was shot repeatedly by multiple officers. Silver was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter. “Upon initial contact, border agents found Mr. Silver to be acting erratically and noticed what appeared to be a large quantity of materials concealed under a blanket in his backseat,” said Division Chief David Stefans. “When instructed to pull his vehicle to the side for further inspection, Silver abruptly accelerated forward and crashed through a barrier, leaving agents with no choice but to discharge their weapons. A subsequent search of the scene yielded over 20 months’ worth of surveys of likely voters, election models, and long-term electoral forecasts concealed in numerous places throughout the vehicle.” “We can verify at this time that Mr. Silver was in possession of every piece of U.S. polling information dating back to last spring when he attempted to flee the country,” Stefans added.  Officials stated that in addition to the thousands of presidential election polls found strewn about Silver’s 1984 Oldsmobile 98 following the incident, investigators discovered hundreds of weighted congressional forecasts hidden within the car’s wheel wells. The entirety of Silver’s polls-only and polls-plus forecasts since the beginning of the primaries were also reportedly discovered inside the car’s hollowed-out speaker system. “After he sideswiped a barricade, his trunk popped open, and all these Zogby and Pew surveys came flying out all over the road,” said long-haul trucker Ernesto Nunez, who described watching Silver struggle out of his wrecked vehicle still clutching an armful of high-sample-size phone and online opinion polls. “Even after they struck him a couple times, you could see he was still trying to hold onto as many A-plus–rated surveys as he could.” “He might have made it, too, if he’d just dumped all the Monmouth University tracking polls on the ground and made a quick break for the Rio Grande,” Nunez added. According to authorities, a posthumous search of Silver’s person also found a stash of bullet-ridden Ciruli Associates and ABC News/Washington Post polls duct-taped to his legs and abdomen. While officials refused to speculate on the matter, they noted that an autopsy would be conducted in the next several days to determine if the statistician had ingested any further polling data or secreted it in any of his orifices for transport across the border. “We thought we’d removed every poll from the vehicle after we pried open the glove compartment and found all the Rasmussens he’d stuffed under there, but then we cut open the upholstery of the seats and realized he’d packed them full of swing state demographic analyses,” said Border Patrol agent Paul Vasquez. “It wasn’t until we had the K-9 unit go through the vehicle that we discovered Silver was actually using a false bottom under the car’s chassis to smuggle every candidate favorability rating since Ted Cruz announced he was running for the presidency. This guy was thorough.” “We hate to use deadly force, but we’re incredibly lucky we stopped him when we did,” Vasquez continued. “Mr. Silver could have left our country with absolutely no polling numbers, no electoral projections, and no approval ratings just days before the election.” ",1,Nate Silver Gunned Down Attempting To Cross Mexican Border With All 2016 Polling Data
"WALDPORT, OR—A team of anthropologists announced Friday it had discovered an isolated tribe of blissful Americans who have never been exposed to the current presidential campaign or its candidates, noting that the newly identified population lives contentedly in a remote village completely untouched by the 2016 race.  According to researchers from Lewis & Clark College, the peaceful, secluded community along the outskirts of Oregon’s Drift Creek Wilderness remains uncontacted by political canvassers, pollsters, and the election media, allowing its generally cheerful and affable inhabitants to go about their daily lives without ever encountering a political poll, election news story, campaign ad, soundbite, or stump speech. “Upon first entering the village, we immediately noticed how relaxed and upbeat the inhabitants appeared, but it wasn’t until speaking with them directly that we understood how insulated they were from the country’s political climate,” said professor Elizabeth Letts, adding that the tribe’s levels of stress, depression, and anxiety were far lower than those recorded over the past 18 months among the broader American populace. “They actually seem to lead gratifying, well-balanced lives. The adults enjoy eight hours of sleep each night, and in place of discussing politics or the latest revelations about the candidates, they were seen regularly smiling or laughing—not cynically, or as a defense mechanism, even, but out of genuine joy.” “In my 30 years studying human cultures, I’ve never come across a people so happy,” she continued. According to Letts, when tribe members were asked their thoughts on major-party candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, they looked puzzled for a moment and then shrugged their shoulders before grinning warmly and continuing on with their day. Similarly, villagers reportedly appeared confused but at ease when asked about the national mood, saying that as far as they could tell, people were feeling pretty good about everything. The anthropologists confirmed this sense of tranquility permeated all aspects of life in the tribe, observing that when extended families gathered for mealtimes, the tenor of their conversation remained pleasant and amicable, with no subjects deemed off-limits. Moreover, scientists noted that the village lacked any signage, clothing, or other paraphernalia bearing divisive words or imagery, and residents appeared to trust one another and appreciate time spent interacting. “When I brought out my iPad to show them footage of the recent presidential debates, they immediately became agitated, and several of the children started to cry,” said graduate student Lester Reinhold, who explained that the perplexed villagers kept asking him why the people on the screen interrupted each other so often when they didn’t even have anything of value to say. “I explained that one of the two people onstage would be their next leader, and they all gasped and recoiled in horror, with many saying they didn’t see how that could possibly be true.”  “I then tried showing them an attack ad about Donald Trump’s comments and actions toward women, but many of them became terrified and began screaming—that’s when one of the village elders swatted the tablet out of my hand,” he added. “After seeing how upset it made them, I determined that it was in their best interest to keep all audio and video clips from the election cycle away from them for the rest of our onsite study.” Scientists noted that when they surveyed members of the tribe about their expectations for the future, specifically after November 8, the responses they received were universally optimistic. Every villager, regardless of age, gender, or social status within the community, reportedly mentioned how they anticipated things would continue to go as well as they had been going. When asked to name the most pressing issue facing them, a few members of the group reportedly admitted, however, that it had been raining a lot lately, and that a little sunshine might be nice. “This is a perfectly preserved community, probably the last of its kind anywhere,” said Letts, who expressed concern that outside forces such as the ever-lengthening campaign season and an increase of on-the-ground political operatives in the area threatened to encroach on the tribe’s simpler and more satisfying way of life. “Even though they’re disconnected from much of the modern-day world and the daily news cycle, these individuals seemed to possess something we don’t: a true sense of delight and positivity toward everyday existence, like each new day is a gift to be cherished.” “Our society could learn a lot from these people,” she added. At press time, sources confirmed a campaign bus could be seen winding its way down a wooded road toward the village.

"SAN FRANCISCO—Explaining how their company was poised to usher in a bold new era of innovation, founders of local startup Intuihub told reporters Wednesday that their mission is to explore the intersection of technology and another thing. “When you look at where the world is going right now, it just makes a lot of sense to take cutting-edge technology and incorporate it into this other thing,” said Intuihub co-founder Martin Fiske, who explained that the other thing will be modernized and streamlined once it is integrated with the latest technological breakthroughs. “We’re looking out at an exciting new frontier, one in which technology will be used to push the boundaries of what the other thing is capable of.” “And we believe there’s no limit to what we can accomplish when we take technology and the other thing and put them together,” Fiske added. Intuihub will reportedly employ groundbreaking advancements in technology to take the other thing in a variety of new and intriguing directions, including some directions, company officials promised, that have never before been imagined. According to the startup’s founders, their work will forever change the way people think about and interact with the thing. Fiske, who reportedly began his career working solely with the other thing but soon realized that adding technology to what he was doing would “open amazing new doors for the thing,” told reporters that his company has an incredible opportunity to revolutionize both technology and the other thing. Five years from now, he said, the thing is likely to be completely unrecognizable by today’s standards. He pointed out that Intuihub is already disrupting the entire landscape by using technology to make the other thing more accessible and convenient. “Technology is evolving, and the other thing needs to evolve along with it,” said Fiske, noting that no other company focusing on the other thing is using technology the way Intuihub is. “The synergy between technology and this thing will be so strong that when the two come together, they may actually create a third thing, one that we believe could be truly world-altering.” After describing their plans to launch a revolution that will change the lives of millions for the better, Intuihub founders confirmed they were also interested in partnering with brands to create more personalized experiences for the thing’s consumers.

"In recent weeks, a dozen women have come forward alleging that presidential nominee Donald J. Trump made unwanted sexual advances on them. Each of these accusers has operated, seemingly in collusion, with the sole intention of spreading outrageous falsehoods to undermine a man of great esteem and resources. Not only has this rank slander dealt a grievous blow to Mr. Trump’s reputation, but the words of these women have stained America’s legacy of fair and respectable electoral politics, and we at this newspaper can no longer stand idly by while such brazen and criminal defamation goes unpunished.  It is with this in mind that the editorial board of   has unanimously voted, with all due humility, to offer up our offices to imprison the women who have wrongfully assailed Mr. Trump’s honor and good name. We urge the public to recall that Mr. Trump is not only a globally successful businessman with a net worth in the billions of dollars, but also an aspirant to this nation’s highest office. As such, these accusations—all of them libelous and wildly defamatory—stand to profoundly erode his stature in the public eye at this critical juncture in the election cycle, which is why those responsible must be made an example of. Moving with all due haste to incarcerate these women within  ’s detention cells would, in our opinion, put a swift and resounding end to their present smear campaign and further act to dissuade future maligners from coming forward. The editorial board of this newspaper has taken the liberty of readying a private security unit to find these women wherever they may be hiding, apprehend them with all necessary force, and remove them from the society that they, through their cowardly actions, have forfeited their right to be a part of. We ask only for the assent of Mr. Trump himself. We recognize that the Trump campaign may have questions about  ’s prison facilities and whether the conditions within them will be sufficiently isolating and punitive in light of the egregious character assaults these women have leveled against the Republican candidate. The editors of this newspaper would like to assure Mr. Trump and his staff that   takes incarceration very seriously. Indeed, our detainment complex is recognized as one of the world’s premier black sites for extraordinary rendition by many foreign intelligence agencies, and we presently confine hundreds of dissidents and activists on behalf of our government partners in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, and elsewhere. Allow us to further assuage any doubts by elaborating on the conditions these liars and conspirators can expect while imprisoned within our headquarters: If the potential for escape is a reason for concern, Mr. Trump, rest assured that   has operated private correctional facilities since the Spanish-American War, when we successfully detained the most violent and wily of Spaniards, and not a single prison break has ever been successfully orchestrated from our confines. For more than 100 years,  ’s prisons have held the most cunning inmates, ranging from French traitor Alfred Dreyfus, to the seditious operatives exposed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, to Salman Rushdie. We would warmly welcome the addition of these women who have so contemptibly borne false witness against a political standard-bearer and American icon. Indeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? We most certainly believe so. It is  ’s firm conviction that in order for civility in our republic to endure, those seeking to lead the people must be freed from fear of scurrilous aspersions that threaten the very governance of our nation. Only through vigilant prosecution and punishment of those responsible for impugning Donald J. Trump’s character can we secure this noble aim. Anything less would be a dishonor to the very tenets upon which this newspaper was founded. Mr. Trump, we await your permission to incarcerate these deceitful women. It would be our distinct privilege. ",1,The Onion Humbly Offers Up Its Offices To Imprison The Women Who Have Wrongfully Accused Donald Trump
"BURBANK, CA—Citing a groundswell of praise for such stereotype-bucking princess films as  ,  , and  , Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Thursday his company has probably accumulated enough goodwill to make its next animated feature a real sexist one. Though still unsure whether the forthcoming fairy-tale adventure would center on a helpless Dutch peasant who splits her time between domestic duties and pining for a rich man, a vain young princess who constantly preens in front of any reflective surface, or a curvaceous, long-lashed horse who inexplicably has rouged cheeks and eye shadow, top Disney officials agreed they are well positioned to sneak in an overly chauvinistic film that exploits antiquated female stereotypes for all they’re worth. “We’ve had a pretty solid run of strong, independent heroines, so I think we’ve racked up enough cred to get back to what we do best and make a regular old damsel-in-distress picture with some real heavy themes about purity,” said Iger, surmising that after the studio’s recent streak of well-rounded female protagonists, audiences would surely let a “real dumb one” slide. “At this point, I think we’ll be fine if we slip in a movie with some blond girl who always combs her hair, sings sad songs about the man she’s longing for, and otherwise doesn’t say much. Or maybe she’s a foolish, overly emotional robin who is constantly patted on the head and kept in line by her knowing father.” “Either way, she’ll only be able to titter coyly, weep, or fret,” Iger continued. “And she’ll definitely completely alter who she is to win the heart of her love interest. I’d say we can probably get away with that.” Noting that critics have given them a tremendous amount of credit in recent years for creating female leads who are plucky, self-reliant, and get by on their wits, Iger said there will never be a better time to give the go-ahead to a screenplay that hinges on a passive young woman who does nothing but wait in place for a man to come validate her existence through marriage. The CEO also indicated that churning out a story in which all the female characters are either petty, naive, vapid, or love-crazy, and in which the lone voices of reason come from levelheaded male woodland creatures or paternalistic sorcerers, would be “a walk in the park” for his creative team. According to Iger, Disney believes it now has the cultural cachet to make its most misogynist movie in years, perhaps by going back to a female lead whose life is empty, unfulfilling, and valueless until the moment she receives true love’s first kiss. While the film has yet to be storyboarded, Iger added that it is a given that the heroine will be so helpless and unable to make decisions on her own that she will require the aid of small animals to guide her at critical moments. “We’re still kicking around ideas, but I can tell you that if we dip back into the princess well, the main character will be thin, pretty, and white—that much we’re sure of,” said Iger, stressing that Disney’s executive board had given writers the green light to “revert to the basics” on this one. “We don’t have to do any of that   garbage for a while. We did  , we did  , so we’re all set for diversity right now. Audiences can expect a real porcelain-skinned one with disproportionately large blue eyes and a waist so small it couldn’t possibly contain functioning organs.” “And even though she’s supposed to be just 15 or something like that, we’ll definitely give her a full hourglass figure and a few skintight outfits,” he added. “We definitely have enough goodwill in the tank to pull that off.” Executives confirmed that as long as Disney’s audience is willing to bear with them on this one, a completely sexist blockbuster could prove to be a huge boon for the media company, spawning a lucrative franchise that could extend to several sexist sequels and even a degrading Broadway musical adaptation. However, Iger noted that the company’s merchandising department would be the primary beneficiary of the movie’s success. By implying to another generation of young girls that their principal value as individuals lies in being deferential, sexually desirable beings, the movie would help the company continue to cash in on its profitable line of princess-themed dolls, clothing, personal products, and video games, the CEO confided to reporters. “Look, at the end of the day, we’re trying to move some product here,” Iger said. “No one asks for Mulan wearing shapeless warrior’s armor for Christmas. So we’re putting the next one in sparkly heels, a tiara, and a form-fitting dress slit to the thigh. End of story.” ",1,Disney CEO Figures They’ve Built Up Enough Goodwill To Do A Real Sexist One
"WASHINGTON—Promising citizens that they would finally take action if the President crossed this new red line, GOP leaders announced Monday that they were moving their goalposts for opposing Trump to him being filmed masturbating on an American flag in Arlington National Cemetery. “After today’s attack on U.S. intelligence agencies, we have officially moved our line in the sand to President Trump being caught on video, vigorously pleasuring himself to completion amid the graves of fallen U.S. soldiers,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who claimed that in order for Republican officials to begin blocking Trump’s nominations or voting against his policies, the video must be at least a half hour of the president with his pants around his ankles, humming the national anthem, and giving the middle finger to the Tomb Of The Unknown Soldier. “Unless we see clear footage of President Trump looking into the camera, his face twisting in pleasure as he climaxes, we will refrain from taking any concrete measures to reel him in. If Trump is masturbating on a flag anywhere other than Arlington, or if he does not ejaculate directly on Old Glory, we will continue to stand behind him. And if fewer than 100 eyewitnesses see him engaged in the masturbation, we will dismiss it as hearsay. Of course, it goes without saying that if he claims it was a joke, all will be forgiven.” McConnell added that Republicans would stand firm on their new line for President Trump except in the extraordinary circumstance of another open seat on the Supreme Court.

"NEW YORK—Marking the joyous occasion with singing, dancing, and a chorus of ecstatic cheers, an estimated 2 million citizens gathered beneath the Times Square countdown clock Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the 2016 election season, sources reported. The crowd of revelers—many of whom had arrived in the early morning to stake out prime viewing locations—reportedly swelled in volume throughout the night, spilling over into nearby streets as many popped bottles of champagne, embraced loved ones, and finally joined together in a boisterous countdown seconds before the polls were scheduled to close.  “God, this is so amazing,” said local man Mark Edwards, gazing up at a fireworks display signaling the conclusion of the incessant media coverage, debates, stump speeches, and campaign advertisements of the election cycle. “I can’t even begin to describe how excited everyone is here. It’s really unbelievable.” “Wooooo!” he shouted, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of Kool & The Gang’s “Celebration” emanating from loudspeakers situated on buildings around the square. According to witnesses, the scene was one of unbridled merriment, with roars of delight sweeping through the crowd every time the enormous LED screens in Times Square showed that voting had ended in another state. As vote totals began to come in, thousands in attendance reportedly raised their arms in jubilation, unfurled homemade banners, or placed calls to family members, often yelling to be heard over the sound of whistles, noisemakers, and the exuberant din of the crowd. Throughout the night’s revelry, celebrants were also seen craning their necks and hoisting children onto their shoulders to view the One Times Square Astrovision screen displaying live feeds of equally raucous celebrations in downtown Los Angeles, Chicago’s Loop, Miami Beach, Market Square Park in Houston, and other locations throughout the country “We stood out in the cold all day to get a good spot, but what’s a few extra hours of discomfort when you’ve been looking forward to this for so long?” said Alice Castillo, who told reporters she had driven there from Baltimore with her two daughters to be part of the excitement. “Could we have stayed home and watched it all on TV? Of course. But nothing compares to the thrill of sharing this incredible moment with so many other people.” “When the clock struck zero and everyone erupted into cheers, it was pretty magical,” Castillo added. While the crowd was said to have thinned after the polls closed along the East Coast, a reported 250,000 remained well into the night to take in the joyful atmosphere and pack the area’s overflowing bars. One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night’s festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. “Beginning tomorrow, I’m going to try to cherish every second I have where I don’t hear the phrase ‘swing state’ or see footage from a campaign rally,” Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump’s or Hillary Clinton’s latest statements. “For tonight, though, I’m just soaking up as much of this moment as I can.” Added Cleaver, “I’m already excited to come back and do this again in 2020.” ",1,Millions Gather Under Times Square Countdown Clock To Celebrate End Of 2016 Election
"CHICAGO—Increasingly confused and embittered after noticing several eerie similarities over the course of their chit-chat, local woman Carrie Vance reportedly felt a twinge of betrayal Friday while sitting in the waiting room of her local salon and watching her hairdresser make small talk with another customer. “What the hell? I thought we had something special,” said Vance, looking on in horror as she overheard her hair stylist asking the other woman about her job and the weather just as the two of them had discussed at their first appointment three months earlier. “Now she’s asking her where she’s originally from? Wow, this sort of stings. We had such a nice conversation during my last haircut—I really thought she was opening up to me—and now it’s clear it was all an act. God, I feel like such an idiot.” At press time, Vance reported feeling “completely devastated” after her hairdresser began their follow-up appointment by repeating the exact same smalltalk as when they first met.

"WASHINGTON—Quickly crumpling up all 500 pages of the legislation upon hearing footsteps in the hallway, sources reported Tuesday that a panicked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shoved the entire Senate healthcare bill in his mouth as a Democratic senator walked past. According to witnesses, McConnell became visibly flustered upon realizing there was no place to hide from the Democratic colleague approaching his doorway and began ripping wads of documents from a binder and cramming them through his open jaws as rapidly as possible. Asked about the location of an upcoming meeting, McConnell, cheeks distended to many times their original size, reportedly grunted several times and gestured toward a nearby conference room. At press time, McConnell had spit out the massive clump of saliva-coated, half-chewed papers, which, while largely illegible, would reportedly insure 10 million more people than the original.

"Hey there, it’s your ol’ pal, Mitch. How’ve you been? Great, great. Anyways, I got a small favor to ask. You see, I’ve got this problem that’s been bothering me for a while and I was kind of hoping you could give me a hand with it. Basically, it would really, really help me out right now if you could just give up your health insurance this one time. I know, I know, you’ve got other things to deal with right now. I get it. But I’m kind of in a pinch at the moment and if you just want to go ahead and get rid of your health coverage, as well as any coverage for your spouse and children, I’d greatly appreciate it. Seriously, it would mean so much to me if you did that. Honestly, it would be pretty quick and easy. All you have to do is take a minute or two and dump whatever insurance you’ve got: HMO, PPO, prescription drug coverage, opioid treatment, mental health services, hospice care, everything. Oh, and your maternity leave. I’m definitely gonna need that, too. If I’m being honest, the sooner you could eliminate those things, the better it would be for me. And let me make it clear: this is all I’m asking. You drop your access to affordable healthcare just this once and I swear I won’t bother you again. That’s it. Promise. C’mon. Believe me, I do not want to be inconveniencing you like this. You think I like coming here, hat in hand, urging you to cast aside your means of coping with medical expenses? I don’t. Honestly, I feel like a fool having to ask you to give up the policies that provide with you cost-free preventative care and ensure your family doesn’t succumb to financial ruin in the event of a health crisis, but truth be told, I’m in a tight spot here. A real tight spot. So what do you say? Could you find it in your heart to do this one little thing for ol’ Mitchy Boy?  Hey, you know I’ve been there for you in the past. Remember that infrastructure bill a couple years ago? Or what about those tax-cut extensions back in 2010? Those were pretty good times, right? So what do you say you just do me this solid and get rid of whatever policy you and your family have? Please? I’d owe you one. Still no? Oh, so you’d rather hold onto your precious insurance than help your friend Mitch out of a jam? Jesus Christ, what’s with you? I ask you to do one little thing for me and this is what I get? Fine. Have it your way. You know what, keep your stupid health insurance—I’ll just go and redirect an increasing share of your income to multinational corporations and the nation’s wealthiest citizens and see how you like that!

"WASHINGTON—Saying the circumstances of this year’s presidential race made the upgrade necessary, election commissions throughout the country were reportedly working to install new heavy-duty voting machines this week that will allow Americans to physically take out their frustrations on the devices before casting their votes. According to Premier Election Solutions, the manufacturer of the new Citadel electronic voting machine, each unit features an easy-to-navigate interface, keeps accurate and secure tallies of votes, and is constructed with durable Kevlar buttons, a shatter-resistant Plexiglas screen, and a reinforced titanium housing, ensuring the devices are able to endure sustained blunt force trauma from voters’ fists and elbows as well as repeated puncturing attempts from sharp objects wielded by exasperated citizens. “These new voting machines were designed specifically with the 2016 election in mind and have been engineered to withstand everything the nation’s voters will bring at them on Election Day,” said company spokesperson Stephen Dunn, who also noted that the units’ Teflon coating makes it easy to wipe down all the sweat and saliva that will accumulate on their surface when they are being repeatedly pummeled in fits of anger. “When 18 months of disgust finally culminate inside the nation’s voting booths, these machines will be able to absorb every punch, kick, and knee drop citizens can dish out while still reliably tabulating totals for all local, state, and national races.” “Like millions of other Americans, I know that I’ll be ready to unload my pent-up rage next Tuesday,” Dunn added. “And our machines will be ready too.” According to Dunn, the Citadel underwent numerous revisions during testing, as a series of early designs proved incapable of withstanding voters’ increasing level of aggravation as the election progressed. Engineers are said to have quickly pulled their prototypes from preliminary field tests during the Virginia and Minnesota primaries upon learning the device’s original plastic housing was splintering to pieces following sharp headbutts from as few as three successive voters. Additionally, internal modifications were reportedly made after Super Tuesday to more securely solder the processor and wiring into place so the unit would maintain functionality each time it was thrown to the ground by a red-faced, screaming voter and continuously kicked for 35 minutes straight. In a later trial during the Wisconsin primary, when the Republican field had been effectively whittled down to just Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, Dunn said the design team came up with the idea to attach an aluminum baseball bat to the side of the machine with a steel cord, noting that if they didn’t provide voters with a convenient weapon, they would physically rip the unit’s legs off and beat it with those to the point of exhaustion. “Our test models were really pushed to their physical limits during the New Jersey primary in June when it was more or less clear that the country would be left with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as its two choices for president,” said Dunn, explaining that the devices had to survive all-out, abusive barrages from every voter who entered their testing precincts in Passaic County. “Thankfully, we had incorporated military-grade armor plating into the machines by that point, which proved able to sustain everything from being repeatedly smashed up against a cinder-block gymnasium wall to being dragged up and then pushed down flights of church basement stairs several times in a row.” “Of course, that was the night we learned we needed to make the touchscreen bulletproof, though,” Dunn continued. According to poll workers, excitement about the new machines appears to have increased voter turnout in the general election, with early voting up by as much as 30 percent in states where the units have already been installed, forcing many polling places to institute time limits on how long voters can batter, stomp on, and bite the units in raving bouts of hysterics. “It was nice to get in there and finally cast my ballot,” said 55-year-old Gordon Mulner, an early voter in Fredericksburg, VA, panting heavily as he wiped away the sheen of sweat from his brow with his raw, bleeding knuckles. “I had to wait in line a little while, but it was worth it. It felt good to make my voice heard.” “I think I broke my hand,” he added. At press time, election officials were scrambling to chain the machines to precinct walls, as it became apparent they would need to prevent voters from lugging them into the parking lot and repeatedly backing over them with their cars.

"WASHINGTON—Weighing the importance of the information against the potential political fallout, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) debated Friday whether or not now might be a prudent time to introduce into discussion the seven highly credible murder accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that were given to her in August. “Roughly five weeks ago, the family members of five slain women and two men presented me with dozens of file boxes full of concrete, corroborated evidence that Kavanaugh was personally and solely responsible for the deaths, and I’m now experiencing a strong feeling that maybe the other Senators, the media, and the American public should know,” said Feinstein, who also disclosed that dozens of people had come forward with information further connecting Kavanaugh to a string of brutal stranglings committed from 1986 to 2011, but had been turned away over concerns that it wasn’t relevant to the confirmation process. “His fingerprints are all over the crime scenes, there is DNA evidence from blood he left, and there are three dozen eyewitnesses. But information like that could really energize the Republican base, so you can see my dilemma here.” At press time, Feinstein had decided to sit on the evidence until a more politically expedient time.

"NEW YORK—Suspicious after many patrons noted the hollow thunking noise produced by knocking on the building’s exterior, a group of forensic architects confirmed Friday that the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, long an architectural mainstay of Manhattan’s Upper East side was, in fact, a forgery. “It seems like a legit Lloyd Wright at first, but the colors are a little dull. The original ‘Gug’ has four sections in the cylindrical part instead of only three, and if you go around in back, you can see an entre wing is missing,” said architectural historian Rupert Montgomery, who further noted the cheap plywood construction and the fact that the roof of the knock-off Guggenheim, unlike most of Frank Lloyd Wright’s creations, does not leak. “We compared this current ‘Guggenheim’ with some older photos and realized the switch happened about 2012, which is when modern American impressionist museums began fetching huge sums on the black market. The real Guggenheim is almost certainly in some Saudi’s private collection by now.” Montgomery recommended that cities always keep an eye on their major landmarks, especially during the tourist season.

"NEW YORK—Scoffing as they stood behind a podium and held out their arms with palms upturned, members of the National Association of Enablers held a press conference Monday urging Americans to c’mon. The group of leading enablers from across the country reportedly convened this week with the express purpose of persuading the entire U.S. populace to stop thinking so hard about everything and just get on with it already. “C’mon,” said spokesperson Martin Grimm, standing alongside members of his organization who were seen crossing their arms, cocking their heads to one side, or sneering. “Do it.” “C’mon,” he added. Grimm then reportedly paused for a few seconds, put his hands in his pockets, and jutted his chin out before repeating the phrase several more times.  According to reports, getting the nation to c’mon has been the foremost initiative of the National Association of Enablers since its founding in 1985. Sources confirmed the group has since expanded its presence to nearly every corner of the country, fulfilling its mission to tell residents of all 50 states that they really need to lighten up and just go for it. “What’s the worst that could happen?” Grimm asked the audience, dismissing whatever concerns the American people might have with a wave of his hand and suggesting they were worrying over nothing. “What’re you waiting for, huh? Let’s go.” At that point, sources reported that one of the enablers standing to Grimm’s side, who was said to be clad in a tank top that revealed imposing musculature, leaned over to the microphone and pleaded with Americans not to be a bunch of wusses, especially when what they were talking about wasn’t even that big of a deal. The enabler then insisted there was nothing stopping the nation’s 324 million people from just doing this, and he stated, furthermore, that they’d probably like it anyway.  “You gotta,” said another of the enablers while loudly chewing gum, assuring the public it wouldn’t get hurt or anything. “Stop wasting everyone’s time and just get it over with.” “You scared or something?” he continued. “C’mon.” At press time, the American people had reportedly hung their heads in unison, looked sheepishly down at their feet, and reluctantly given in.

"WASHINGTON—Decrying the tactics as a smear campaign against an exemplary judge, Republicans blasted Brett Kavanaugh Friday for destroying the sterling reputation of a good man. “It’s despicable that this individual waited until the 11th hour to engage in offensive, partisan attacks in an attempt to discredit a decent and upstanding man,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), noting that Kavanaugh’s recriminations had repeatedly made a mockery of the entire confirmation process. “We’re talking about a devoted husband and father who was the top of his class at Yale and received accolades from the American Bar Association. And now his life has been destroyed by a completely non-credible individual bent on revenge. He has cast a cloud over this esteemed man and he should be deeply ashamed of the damage he has done to his family and the country as a whole.” Grassley added that he was confident the nomination of a morally upright man who had served his country for decades would not be derailed by the ravings of an inveterate liar like Kavanaugh.  ",1,Kavanaugh Blasted For Destroying Reputation Of Good Man
"MILFORD, CT—Announcing the creation of a genetically viable new menu item they said could soon appear in franchises nationwide, researchers with Subway’s sandwich breeding program revealed Thursday they had successfully developed a Black Forest Ham–Meatball Marinara hybrid. The footlong sub, which company officials say was selectively bred to incorporate the zesty traits of the Meatball Marinara bloodline with the natural smokiness of the Black Forest Ham genus, was unveiled at a press conference at Subway’s main sandwich breeding and husbandry facility within its corporate headquarters. “It’s taken over six years of genomic research and countless breeding attempts, but I’m happy to report that we’ve produced a robust new offspring from two of our most delicious subs,” said Noah Plattner, director of Subway’s sandwich breeding division, adding that the hybrid was morphologically compatible with any of the chain’s nine bread options. “This was a group effort that required the skills of our professional handlers, technicians, and fertility experts, all of whom worked without rest to produce this perfectly bred combination of succulent ham, fresh vegetables, and tangy marinara sauce.” “Everyone involved in the creation of S-74G—or the Black Forest Marinara Combo, as it has been dubbed by our team of geneticists—should be extremely proud,” he added. According to Plattner, the hybrid sandwich began as an attempt to improve the stock of the popular but increasingly inbred Meatball Marinara pedigree by crossbreeding it with a suitable mate. Scientists at the company’s state-of-the-art $200 million breeding laboratory identified the Black Forest Ham as a possible sire due to its heartiness, adaptability, and hereditary cheese layers. After observing improvements in longevity and succulence over the first several generations of offspring, the research team reportedly decided to ramp up the number of mating sessions per week in the hopes of breeding out a latent sogginess trait and increasing the progeny’s natural tolerance to a wider variety of sauces. “The results were promising right from the outset—taste-wise, S-74G seemed to take the best attributes of both parents while exhibiting an innate savoriness all its own,” said Plattner, who oversaw the selection of each procreative pair. “Moreover, the hybrid’s physical traits—in particular, its juicy yet cohesive mouthfeel—were found to be highly appealing to customers in our Provo, UT test market, even more so than the subs in its ancestral lineage.” Added Plattner, “This is a very promising new specimen that I can see being offered alongside our heritage breeds, like the Roast Beef, Cold Cut Combo, and Italian B.M.T., for a long time to come.” Subway officials went on to note how smoothly the process of crossing the two disparate subgenera had gone, given that the varying windows of fertility for each sandwich breed often cause complications for mating. Company scientists also explained the vital role that the various strains’ temperaments play in the interbreeding process, citing an incident in 2009 when an entire brood of docile Veggie Delite sandwiches were lost after being left unsupervised around a group of much larger and more aggressive Steak & Cheese subs. In another case illustrating the challenges of sandwich husbandry, Plattner described how researchers had spent months trying to coax the notoriously wary and apprehensive Subway Club and a Spicy Italian to breed naturally before finally resorting to artificial insemination. “Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for cross-breeding attempts to show promise at first, only to yield a litter of sickly, undersized offspring,” Plattner said. “But that’s just the nature of our work. Some sandwiches reproduce with no trouble whatsoever, while other times you can mate two fertile, seemingly compatible subs, such as the Turkey Breast and Chicken & Bacon Ranch Melt, and then find out that their progeny is utterly inedible. Frankly, most of the specimens we produce here are too malformed and grotesque to proceed forward with and have to be euthanized.” “However, sometimes even our mistakes turn out to be happy accidents,” he continued. “The Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki was only created through a mishap in our gene-splicing lab, and never in a million years did we think anyone would want to actually eat it.” ",1,Subway Breeding Program Successfully Creates Black Forest Ham–Meatball Marinara Hybrid
"GARDINER, MT—Fending off the large wildcat moments before it could harm her best friend, presidential pet Sunny reportedly saved fellow first dog Bo from a mountain lion attack last month as they journeyed across the country to find their way back to the Obama family. Sources said the White House’s two canine residents, who were accidentally left behind by the first family during a trip to Yellowstone National Park, encountered the mountain lion while making their way through the Montana wilderness. According to reports, Bo, who had become separated from his companion earlier in the day when he slid into a ravine, was cornered by the predator against a large tree trunk and seemed to have no means of escape until Sunny, having seemingly appeared out of nowhere, came rushing to his aid at the last possible second.  “Bo, get out of the way!” said Sunny, her teeth bared and her fur bristling as she lunged toward the menacing cougar, ultimately scaring it back into the forest. “That’s right! Run away, you coward! Nobody’s going to hurt my friend while I’m around!” “Don’t worry, Bo,” she added. “You’re safe now.” Administration officials said the two Portuguese water dogs were mistakenly left in Yellowstone by the vacationing Obamas, who returned home believing Sunny and Bo had been loaded aboard Air Force One, never realizing the pair had scampered off the tarmac and into the woods moments before takeoff to chase a squirrel. It is believed that the dogs later returned to the spot where they had last scented Barack, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha Obama and, after sitting patiently overnight until realizing the family was not going to return, decided to find their way back to Washington, D.C. on their own, beginning a 2,000-mile journey eastward. The first pets reportedly spent the next few days bounding over mountain passes and wading through rocky streams, from which Bo would, after several fruitless attempts, emerge with a fish in his mouth, providing much-needed sustenance to the pair, who were accustomed to being fed nutritious meals at regular intervals by their White House handlers. Early on in their trek, Sunny and Bo are said to have encountered several hikers they thought might rescue them. However, the group turned out to be German tourists who, reportedly failing to recognize the presidential seal on the dogs’ collars, simply pet them, fed them some dried fruit, and continued on their way.  “What do you think they’re eating at the state dinner tonight?” Bo asked a tired, disinterested Sunny as the two crouched inside a hollow tree trunk where they had been forced to take shelter during a particularly fierce storm. “I bet they’re having steak. Oh, man, I can almost taste it now. That’s my absolute favorite. Do you think Malia is saving her leftovers for me? I bet she is.” “I miss Washington,” Bo continued. “We’ll be back home soon, though, right?” According to sources, rarely a day of their adventure went by without the two dogs getting into a precarious situation that required them to rely on each other to get through. At one point, after traveling for a day without water, Sunny reportedly came upon a rushing river and, in her eagerness to take a drink, slipped on a rock, fell in, and was swept away by the powerful current. Bo is believed to have reached the river’s edge just in time to see Sunny’s head pop up and disappear around the bend. With neither dog having much swimming experience outside the White House pool, sources said a quick-thinking Bo ran downstream as fast as he could, grabbed one end of a long stick in his jaws, extended it out over the water, had Sunny bite down on the other end, and managed to pull her to safety just before she would have plunged over a waterfall. Several weeks later, sources reported that a curious Bo followed an unusual scent into a hollow log lying on its side in the Black Hills, only to come scrambling out moments later pursued by a slowly ambling porcupine. Bo is said to have spent the rest of the evening whimpering as Sunny carefully removed the quills stuck in her companion’s muzzle using her teeth, at one point pausing to say, “You have to go and stick your nose in everything, don’t you?” Cold and hungry as they crossed through barren, wintry terrain, the first dogs were reportedly found trudging through chest-deep snow by a kindly old man who let them stay for a time in his small and humble cabin, surroundings that were far removed from the accommodations that Sunny, who was purchased from a professional breeder, and Bo, who was a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), were used to. According to reports, the old man allowed the pair to join his team of sled dogs, who initially bullied the White House pets for their pampered backgrounds. “You call yourselves dogs, do you?” said Avalanche, a hulking husky and the lead dog on the old man’s sled team. “Something tells me you’ve had everything in life handed to you on a silver dog dish. That may be the way things work in Washington, D.C., but around here we have to earn our keep. This is no place for lapdogs.” Later, sources stated, Sunny and Bo earned the respect of that same dog when they worked together to save several members of the sled team who had fallen through a patch of thin ice during a routine supply run. Unbeknownst to the pair as they made their way across the country, the Obamas were said to be desperately trying to locate the pets they missed so much. According to sources, Sasha and Malia Obama put up flyers all around the nation’s capital and asked every congressman they encountered to keep an eye out for the dogs in their home districts. Reports indicate that Sasha also went to bed each night looking at an old photo of her beloved pets, promising aloud that they would all be reunited one day. As the first dogs passed through the Midwest on their trek homeward, they reportedly came upon a small city where, much to their delight, they heard the unmistakable sound of their owner’s voice. Barking excitedly as they ran toward it, they are believed to have rounded a corner only to discover President Obama giving a speech on the screen of a television in an electronics store. Reports confirmed the pair, having caused quite a commotion, were then chased down the block by the town’s dogcatcher, escaping only after Bo bit the man on the seat of his pants, causing him to yelp in pain and exposing his heart-patterned boxer shorts to passersby beneath the flap of torn fabric. Some days later, Sunny and Bo appeared ready to give up, having convinced themselves they would never again sniff fresh tomatoes from Michelle Obama’s vegetable garden or receive one of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew’s signature belly rubs. Deciding they were simply too tired and demoralized to continue onward, the pair are said to have stopped to sleep for the night in the bed of a beat-up, old pickup truck. Sources said they were jarred awake in the morning when the engine roared to life and the pickup lurched out onto the highway. After initially panicking when they realized they were being driven to an unknown destination, the two dogs reportedly soon found themselves enjoying the breeze rushing through their fur and the vast stretches of ground they were quickly covering. Several hours later, the dogs are said to have smelled something familiar, perking their heads up over the tailgate and then howling in delight when they saw trees filled with pink cherry blossoms growing denser around them. “Wait a second, I recognize those barks,” said President Obama, interrupting his introduction of a judicial nominee at a Rose Garden press conference to discover the dogs bounding across the South Lawn toward him. “Quick, get Sasha and Malia! Oh, my goodness! Where on earth have you rascals been?” “Everyone get out here!” he continued, embracing Sunny and Bo as they eagerly licked his face and the first family came running to welcome them home. “They’re back!” At press time, Michelle Obama was reportedly rolling her eyes and saying “I guess everything’s back to normal” as the family sat down for their first meal together since their reunion and heard the unmistakable sound of Bo lapping water from an East Wing toilet.

It was just a dream,” said Trump, just before seeing the very real, tiny wounds on his arms and chest that mirrored the lacerations he had received as the psychotic special prosecutor pursued him down the halls of the White House within his nightmare, laughing maniacally while he slashed violently at the president. “What—no. This isn’t possible. It was a dream! It was just a dream!” Trump later discovered that he was still asleep the moment Robert Mueller’s razor claws burst through the president’s mattress, dragging his struggling body down into its seemingly endless depths.

"PARKER, CO—In what doctors are calling a true medical miracle, local construction worker Kal Mathyssen awoke from a week-long coma early Wednesday with the ability to fully comprehend his health insurance plan, sources at Parker Adventist Hospital confirmed. Mathyssen, who sustained a severe head injury after a fall at a nearby job site, reportedly stunned hospital staff and family members when he suddenly regained consciousness around 1 a.m. and began confidently filling out all the paperwork required by managed care company Aetna to receive the benefits guaranteed by his insurance policy. “I was online struggling to figure out what is and isn’t covered by our plan, and then Kal just woke up and somehow knew exactly what needed to be done,” said Mathyssen’s wife, Carol, explaining that prior to his coma, her husband had possessed only an average person’s understanding of the process required to file for reimbursement of medical expenses. “Kal was on the phone using words I’d never heard come out of his mouth before—stuff about billing codes, out-of-pocket maximums, and I don’t know what else.” “As soon as he picked up the claim form and knew exactly what to fill in on the line marked ‘employee group number,’ I knew something was very different,” she continued. “It was just so clear that something had changed inside him.” According to doctors, within minutes of waking up in the intensive care unit, the 38-year-old began to display an unusually strong grasp of his Aetna Preferred health plan. Astonished onlookers confirmed that after consulting his insurer’s website and listening to a series of recorded messages on a customer service line, Mathyssen determined he would be responsible for a $250 emergency room copay, the amount remaining on his policy’s aggregate family deductible, and the full sticker price of any non-formulary medications he may require during his recovery. In addition, several of Mathyssen’s family members said they had a difficult time believing that the man who emerged from the coma was the same person they had always known, pointing out that their relative, who has seldom made use of his Health Savings Account in the past, showed a rare ability to determine which bills he would be able to pay for with his HSA debit card and which nonqualified expenses he would have to pay for with his savings or, should that become depleted, through a monthly installment plan.  “In 21 years of practicing emergency medicine, I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Dr. Peggy Adams, who visited Mathyssen during her morning rounds, when the patient reportedly asked about receiving a flu shot and other preventative care procedures his plan covers in full. “It’s impressive that he’s so calm and lucid at this stage, but it’s truly astounding that he knew to ask proactively if the hospital was covered as an in-network facility with his HMO.” “He even double-checked with the radiologist to make sure his CT scan would be billed correctly in case the insurance company later disputed the claim,” she added. “He certainly came out of that coma with a unique gift.” Bedside sources said they were left shocked and speechless when Mathyssen later picked up his cell phone and not only reached the person he needed to speak with in Aetna’s benefits department, but also had a cordial conversation in which he appeared to follow everything the representative was saying, ending the call in less than five minutes with a reference number documenting the exchange. “I’ve tried to come up with an explanation for what caused this, but I’m at a loss, other than to say it’s one of the mysteries of human cognition,” said Adams, calling Mathyssen’s case “one in a million.” “I suppose one minute you can be on a ventilator fighting for your life, and the next you can be entirely aware that your emergency room visit is covered at a different rate than your EMS transfer, and that the latter is billed directly by the ambulance company that 911 dispatched to pick you up.

"Our country stands at a pivotal inflection point, just five weeks out from a presidential election with wide-reaching implications. With the two leading candidates providing starkly different visions for this country, it is incumbent upon the American people to evaluate the nominees’ stances on the issues and appraise their characters with care and precision. The American people must do so fairly and impartially, without any undue influence or distraction. Which is why, when a cowardly and insidious anonymous source provided   with a complete collection of Donald Trump’s tax returns yesterday morning, our editorial board moved promptly to destroy every last page of these financial records. Tax returns are private documents, and it is  ’s belief that the decision of whether to make them available for public scrutiny should be left solely to the person who filed them. In shredding and then subsequently incinerating the thousands of pages of sensitive and revealing financial information about Mr. Trump,   made the only responsible choice. We believe any journalist, news organization, or advocacy group that would even consider behaving differently in these circumstances—and indeed, any reader who even yet wishes to look upon such private information—should be thoroughly appalled at themselves and their crass, voyeuristic impulses. Let us reiterate: Americans have absolutely no right to see these documents or be made aware of their contents, and that is why we eradicated these records and disposed of what remained of them at a location we refuse to disclose. We take this situation very seriously. Prior to destroying the returns, we consulted with numerous tax professionals who verified the authenticity of the roughly 45,000 pages of documents encompassing Donald Trump’s complete state and federal tax returns for every year in which the candidate ever filed, as well as corporate returns for every Trump-owned business. In keeping with our commitment to the records’ privacy, all of these tax experts were made to sign strict non-disclosure agreements to prevent them from sharing any information gleaned from the documents. Let us assure you that any breach of said agreements will be met with swift and comprehensive legal action and will bring to bear the full tools of journalism at  ’s disposal to ensure these experts’ reputations, both personal and professional, are tarnished beyond the point of any repair. You may have numerous questions about the tax returns: for instance, whether these documents contained information about Mr. Trump’s income, his businesses’ profits or losses, or any tax maneuvers he may have exercised throughout his lifetime. The answer on all accounts is yes. You may ask whether the filings revealed Mr. Trump’s net worth as it progressed over the course of decades. Again, the answer is yes. You may ask whether the documents revealed how much or how little he paid to the Internal Revenue Service in any or all of the 52 years for which we obtained records. The answer is yes once more. You may ask whether you may see this information for yourself. There, the answer is a decisive and impassioned no. Has our democracy fallen so far that even the most confidential records of business write-offs, shell companies, and overseas financial dealings can now be considered a legitimate subject of public interest? Lesser media outlets may think so, but   will continue to stand by our belief that the sensitive financial disclosures of the wealthy and powerful should be protected from the unauthorized scrutiny of the nation’s voters. In addition to the complete and irrevocable destruction of these documents,   has committed itself to taking the following steps to ensure the continued confidentiality of Mr. Trump’s returns: We believe these steps are necessary to protect the privacy of our nation’s affluent and privileged few, and to discourage less principled “journalists” from infringing on that privacy by sharing unlawfully obtained financial documents. Rest assured, we at   will see that any attempt to violate this norm does not go unpunished. America must vote next month on the candidates and what they stand for, not on their personal and business dealings, which, as long as   has any say in the matter, will always remain private.

"HAMPTON, VA—Explaining that his current employment situation is intended merely as a stopgap, local man Simon Goldinger, 23, confirmed Thursday that he only plans to wait tables until the fundamental structure of the American economy undergoes a complete overhaul. Goldinger, who started working as a server at the Whitecap Grill shortly after graduating college last spring, told reporters he took the job in order to make ends meet while he waits for the entire economic framework of the United States to be reorganized at the most basic level, creating a sufficient number of adequately paid opportunities for individuals with his level of education and experience. “I’m not going to be a waiter forever, just until the nation’s job market becomes less reliant on service-sector positions, and a robust, knowledge-based economy can be built from the ground up and given time to flourish, generating more promising career paths that ensure long-term financial stability for members of the workforce like me,” Goldinger said as he scoured several job-listing websites for signs of an unprecedented transformation in the country’s economic foundations. “I’ve been working at Whitecap for about a year now, but once America goes through some massive fiscal changes and retools itself to an extent unseen since the Second World War, I’m sure I’ll have some better options.” “In any case, this will do for now,” he added. Goldinger explained that he is comfortable working at the restaurant for the time being, as his wages and tips are just enough to pay his bills and cover his share of the rent on the small apartment he shares with two friends while he awaits groundbreaking changes in the labor policies of developing countries, such as onsite safety measures, minimum wage laws, and overtime policies that, if instituted and expanded over the course of years, might eventually make it cost-effective for American companies to move jobs back home, thus allowing him to find a more secure, salaried position. While conceding he had hoped to achieve more professional success by this time in his life, the Virginia native said he will just have to keep looking and trust that the current system through which resources are distributed, with the vast majority of wealth flowing to the richest 1 percent of the population instead of being reinvested in the middle class to create sustainable job growth and boost the standard of living, will be completely upended at some point in the not-too-distant future.  “Waiting tables is just a temporary thing for me, so hopefully it’s just a matter of time before the exponential gains in productivity from increased automation stop creating redundancies in the labor force and the job offers start rolling in,” said Goldinger, who has on numerous occasions texted his friends to ask if they had heard of any game-changing disruptions to the economic status quo capable of reinventing the role workers like him will play in American life for generations to come. “Honestly, though, hanging around here and serving people food isn’t the worst way to get by while I wait for the federal government to renegotiate trade agreements so they include enforcement mechanisms that require all participating nations to protect the rights of workers while simultaneously streamlining our own domestic corporate tax policies and regulatory structure, thereby ensuring that an advanced industrial country like the U.S isn’t at a competitive disadvantage.” He added, “Once that happens, I’m out of here.” At press time, sources confirmed Goldinger was applying to graduate school, hoping that by the time he finishes another degree, a revolutionary full-scale reorientation of the nation’s job market will allow him to earn enough money to pay back his crushing student loan debt.

"CARACAS, VENEZUELA—Sources are confirming that the Central Intelligence Agency has orchestrated a coup d’état in the South American nation of Venezuela, toppling the country’s 30 million residents and replacing them with an entirely new, pro-American populace. According to high-ranking federal officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, the CIA-backed citizens were installed in the early morning hours Thursday shortly after the sitting population was captured and forcibly removed from the country, part of a strategic plan to end political instability in Venezuela and ensure every single inhabitant of the nation is sympathetic to U.S. interests. “Reports we’re hearing from those on the ground indicate all residential households in Venezuela are now occupied by pro-American surrogates,” said Angela Zarush, a Brussels-based foreign policy analyst who described the millions of new Venezuelans as “puppet citizens” handpicked by U.S. intelligence agents. “This was a complicated transfer of power that required the quick, surgical removal of a country’s populace overnight, and the subsequent installation of a replacement society that harbors pro-U.S. leanings. For these reasons, we believe the coup could not possibly have taken place without a significant source of outside financing and the operational expertise of the CIA.” “We went to bed last night with the longtime population of Venezuela seemingly comfortable and secure in their positions; when we awoke this morning, those residents were gone, and in their place were tens of millions of men, women, and children with strong ties to Washington,” she added. “This has the CIA’s fingerprints all over it.” Evidence gathered so far suggests that late last night, a small team of top CIA operatives was airdropped via Blackhawk helicopter into the South American nation, where they bypassed local security forces and apprehended farmers, college students, business owners, President Nicolás Maduro, oil field workers, and millions more, before escorting the overthrown people of Venezuela out of the country. It is believed every resident of the fifth most populous country on the continent was then replaced with a U.S.-friendly counterpart in a matter of hours. The new Venezuelans, who are expected to be far more supportive of U.S. foreign policy, were reportedly lying in wait just across the border in Colombia and were quickly installed under cover of darkness. At approximately 6 a.m., members of the replacement population appeared on television to assure the nation that calm had been restored to its streets. Witnesses said the news was met with celebratory rallies across all 23 of Venezuela’s states, with droves of recently established citizens parading in public squares where they chanted pro-American slogans and carried homemade signs reading “Renew ties with the U.S.A.!” “There is no evidence to suggest the American intelligence community had any involvement in the events that transpired this morning in Venezuela,” CIA director John Brennan told reporters in a morning press conference, dismissing such claims as propaganda intended to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the fledgling populace. “By all accounts, the coup appears to have been a homegrown movement expressing the will of the Venezuelan people, and the United States recognizes the sovereignty of the 30 million new individuals now in place.” Though Brennan disputes the reports, evidence of CIA involvement continues to mount, with witnesses claiming to have seen federal agents unloading thousands of people from the backs of trucks in Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia, and over 330 other municipalities. Some even said they had seen the newly instated inhabitants being outfitted with casual everyday clothing and personal accessories before being released across the 350,000 square miles of the country. At press time, sources confirmed the new Venezuelan populace had already grown displeased at the United States meddling in their affairs and had cut off all communication with Washington.

"The American people are faced with a momentous choice in this election, one that this newspaper, with its 260-year record of reportage, believes to be among the most crucial in the history of our republic. Our nation is beset by grave threats, both at home and abroad. Our population is fractured and teeming with antagonism. Our economy continues to languish. Now, more than ever before, this country needs a strong and capable leader. This year, as in every election cycle, the citizens of the United States have been waiting with great anticipation for the presidential endorsement of our editorial board. This is an awesome and sober responsibility, and rest assured, it is one whose far-reaching impact we understand full well. Which is why we cannot in good faith offer a presidential endorsement until both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald J. Trump mail back completed copies of the 10-part questionnaire we sent them over two months ago. We know that millions of Americans will make their decision based on our recommendation. Thus, it would be much too careless—reckless, in fact—to offer an endorsement without a rigorous tabulation and analysis of the results of these questionnaires. While lesser publications may be perfectly satisfied to publish their electoral recommendations based on nothing more than individual observation and subjective opinion, our editorial board refuses to let the candidates’ public appearances, debate performances, campaign speeches, published statements, or advertisements sway our decision in any way. We believe the appropriate manner by which to make such a vital choice for our country is to directly compare the candidates and their beliefs on a series of identical, meticulously crafted multiple-choice questions. It is the only sensible option when so much is at stake.  editorial board spent considerable time and effort devising a slate of queries that would, with scientific precision, expose the candidates’ most heartfelt beliefs and individual characters, allowing us to accurately ascertain their competence and fitness to lead. We cannot and will not endorse either nominee until we have such information. Indeed, it would be a shameful disservice to this country if we did anything but reserve our judgment. Below, you will find  ’s 2016 Presidential Preparedness Questionnaire. We ask that if Mr. Trump or Secretary Clinton has happened to misplace the copies of this questionnaire that were sent to their campaign headquarters, they print out the following questions on standard 8.5 x 11–inch paper, answer each with the utmost care and candor, and mail the completed document via overnight express to our offices. _____ Name (please print): What do you consider to be the most important issue facing our nation?  How can the debt of the U.S. government be eliminated?  How will you address the problem of homelessness in this country? Please indicate how strongly you agree with the following statements:  Foreigners living within the borders of the United States, and anywhere else in the world, must be made to learn and speak English. Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree  Popular entertainment in this country has gone too far in the direction of excluding strong male figures, and can be blamed for much of the country’s moral decline. Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree  The welcoming of Hawaii into the Union was a grave mistake. Strongly disagree / Disagree / Neither agree nor disagree / Agree / Strongly agree What can be done about the violence and strife in America’s major cities?

We remind them that they must mark their answers with a full and complete circle. IF YOU DO NOT CLOSE YOUR CIRCLES FULLY, WE WILL NOT ENDORSE YOU. We cannot stress this enough. We also ask that Governor Johnson not contact us again, as we have received five separate completed copies of his questionnaire, and do not require any more information from him. The editors of this publication understand that a presidential candidate’s time is precious, but Mr. Trump’s and Secretary Clinton’s failure to return our questionnaire by the stated deadline, which was written prominently in bold on each mailing, is unacceptable.   is providing a great and selfless service to the voting public, and it is imperative that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump act with haste to submit their questionnaires for the good of this nation. We hope that by allowing both candidates an additional seven-day grace period, we may still be able to make an endorsement before Election Day. Otherwise, Americans will have no choice but to head to the polls directionless and ignorant, without the crucial guidance from   they so desperately require.

"LOS ANGELES—In a joint statement confirming that all production would cease immediately, representatives from every Hollywood film studio announced Friday that audiences would not be given any new movies to watch until they had learned to appreciate the ones they already have. The declaration, which was endorsed by all working members of the industry, observed that there are plenty of existing films the American public doesn’t ever bother to watch, and explained that viewers would henceforth receive no new box-office openings and would simply have to make do with the current back catalog of movies. “There will be no more thrillers, comedies, or any of those sequels you’ve been asking for until you can show us you’re grateful for the more than 100 years of cinema we’ve already given you,” Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara told reporters, noting that Hollywood had made tens of thousands of titles for the U.S. populace, and yet it was always asking for more. “We’ve really tried to give you films we think you’d like, but there are quite a few that you’ve never even given a viewing. These things aren’t cheap, you know?” “For God’s sake, some of you have only seen   once,” he added. Sources confirmed that movie lots and sound stages across Los Angeles County had gone dark following the announcement, with screenwriters, set designers, casting directors, cinematographers, and actors all leaving their offices and trailers to go home, where they planned to remain until the public “did something about its behavior” and started having a better attitude toward the rich legacy of American film. The statement indicated that Hollywood wouldn’t even consider making any new movies until viewers demonstrated sincere gratitude for the many cinematic achievements they had already been presented with, including the three-minute, 20-second tracking shot that opens  , the use of Richard Strauss’   in  , the enigmatic ending of  , and the entire running time of Robert Altman’s  . “Before complaining that there are no new westerns to see, how about you go watch one of the 140 or so movies John Ford made?” said Paramount executive LeeAnne Stables, adding that once the nation had fully appreciated the merits of   and  , her industry might look into greenlighting another contribution to the genre. “And remember how much you wanted  , and then we spent $178 million to make it for you and you didn’t even go see it? Well, we’re not doing anything like that again.” “And don’t come crying to us begging for something new with Jennifer Lawrence or those Avengers you like so much, because we’re serious about this,” she continued. “Honestly, you should just be thankful for what you have:  ,  , everything Isabella Rossellini’s ever done,  , the   franchise. You’ve got it pretty good, if you ask me.” Despite protestations from the public, top industry officials maintained they were adamant in their decision, saying that audiences nationwide would never learn to value the movies they had been given in the past if they were constantly being spoiled by a never-ending supply of brand-new biopics, costume dramas, animated features, and music documentaries. Moreover, they insisted there would be no more reboots or remakes until the public had seen every original film in full. “Sure, we could give you a bunch of new romantic comedies, but first you’re going to have to at least try to appreciate   and  ,” filmmaker David Fincher said. “If you can’t learn to respect the talents of great leading men like Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, and Henry Fonda, then you don’t deserve any new Chris Pratt vehicles for a long, long time.” At press time, reports confirmed an irate public was firing back at Hollywood by insisting it had never even asked for another  .

"STANFORD, CA—Saying their findings were consistent across all ages and demographic groups, psychologists at Stanford University released a groundbreaking report this week confirming that feeling bad right now is an extremely accurate predictor of feeling bad forever. The report, which draws its conclusions from a longitudinal study of 500 participants conducted over the course of 30 years, found a nearly perfect correlation between experiencing sadness, anger, loneliness, and despair at the current moment and then continuing to experience those exact same emotions for the rest of one’s life no matter what. “Based on our findings, we can state with a high level of certainty that anyone who feels miserable at the present time will, from this moment onward, always feel miserable,” said the report’s co-author Danielle Bowman, adding that researchers observed zero cases in which a subject’s feelings of sorrow or hopelessness ever went away in the short or long term. “For example, if, at the moment, you are desperately lonely and depressed, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests you will still feel that way when you wake up tomorrow, the day after that, a month from now, in five years, and indeed, every single waking second until you die.” “There were, however, several instances in which people’s emotional states did eventually change,” Bowman continued. “In roughly 31 percent of cases, people began to feel much worse over the years.” According to the study, individuals who currently struggle with feelings of worthlessness and believe there is no way anyone could ever really love them have a 99.8 percent chance of maintaining that state of mind for the remainder of their natural lives. Similarly, the results indicated a state of anguish will be permanent for 99.6 percent of those suffering from a sense that their life is headed in the wrong direction and there is nothing they can do to stop it. The study, which began with clinical trials and field observations in 1986, also concluded that anyone who at any point became anxious or melancholy never again experienced happiness in any form, regardless of any changes in their exercise habits, diet, psychological or pharmacological treatments, relationship status, or employment situation. In addition, the report’s authors recommended that if you feel bad at present, you should simply save yourself further trouble by abandoning any hope of things ever getting better. Greg Hudson, a participant in the study who said he hasn’t felt a pleasant or even neutral emotion since the 1990s, told reporters he agreed with the researchers’ recommendation. “About 20 years ago, I was going through a hard time both at work and at home, putting in too many hours and having difficulty getting along with my boss while at the same time dealing with some marital stress,” said Hudson, a visibly weary man now in his 50s. “Just waking up and getting out of bed every day was like torture. That was in 1997, and I can honestly say that today, after all these years, I feel every bit as awful as I did back then. At no point has anything changed. Ever.” The study also found strong evidence to suggest that feelings of pure joy can be expected to dissipate completely within one to two seconds after they first appear.

"WASHINGTON—Stating they felt deeply unnerved by the community’s unwavering and impassioned defense of a football program and administration that enabled child sexual abuse over the course of several decades, the rest of the country informed Penn State University Friday that there is clearly something very wrong with all of them. The nation’s nearly 320 million citizens all confirmed that the Penn State community’s repeated denials of the school’s culpability, continued displays of reverence for their former football head coach Joe Paterno, and failure to meaningfully acknowledge and respect the victims suggest that they share a very warped perspective on the world and may indeed be suffering from some kind of serious mental health condition. “You all need to know that what you are doing and saying is extremely strange and that you should stop,” said Alex Gilani, 35, of Tacoma, WA, adding that “it should be pretty obvious” that holding halftime tributes to the late Paterno, who did nothing to prevent his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky from sexually abusing dozens of children, is totally unacceptable. “All of us find it very strange that you cheer for him during games, paint his name on signs to hold up in the crowd, and attempt to restore a statue of him on campus.” “That’s not normal,” continued Gilani. “In fact, it’s downright disturbing.” According to reports, residents of all 50 states concurred that only a group of people who lack the most basic sense of self-awareness and decency could whitewash Joe Paterno’s enormous failures while continuing to celebrate his achievements in football. Millions of Americans also repeatedly stressed that Paterno’s decades of off-the-field charity work does not mitigate the damage he caused, and anyone who believes that it does has a dangerously distorted view of reality. The entire populace emphasized that they were “very, very troubled” by suggestions from those affiliated with Penn State that only Sandusky is to blame, and that the university was unfairly targeted at the expense of players and coaches who had nothing to do with the scandal. Focusing on all of those things, rather than the many children molested by one of their coaches, is very bad and very odd, according to virtually every single person outside of State College, PA. Americans went on to say that it would take an extremely sick and troubled mind to read the findings in the Freeh Report and then somehow disagree with Paterno’s immediate firing, while furthermore still believing in restoring his 111 victories confiscated by the NCAA. “Please, take a few minutes to look outside the bubble of Happy Valley and think—really think—about what actually happened at your university under your coach’s watch,” said Sheila Mitchell, 45, of Duluth, MN, adding that “any normal, mature adult” would be able to recognize and accept that their former head coach had made unforgivable mistakes and should no longer be deified by thousands of people. “I mean, imagine if you found out that someone totally unaffiliated with Penn State had known that a man they employed was raping children, and not only did they not alert the authorities, but they didn’t even fire the guy. Would you still like, let alone support, that person? Probably not, right?” “Then again, who knows—maybe you would,” Mitchell added. “Maybe that’s how far gone you really are.” While acknowledging that the unsettling behavior of the Penn State community must represent their way of coping with what happened, many Americans sternly reminded students and alumni that disavowing and distancing themselves from Paterno would not mean they are betraying their school, and would in fact at least start to restore the institution’s reputation across the country. Furthermore, millions of citizens confirmed that while it was perhaps somewhat understandable to feel the impulse to defend their longtime coach when the scandal initially broke, continuing to do so years later is “completely deranged and psychotic.” “If your immediate response to the thought of Joe Paterno is anything other than ‘Forget what he did as a football coach; that guy is a despicable human being, and I never want to see or hear that piece of shit’s name anywhere on the Penn State campus ever again,’ then you’ve totally lost your grasp of right and wrong,” said 29-year-old Sacramento, CA resident Alex Whelen. “Stop acting this way. Please. You’re being a bunch of delusional, selfish assholes.” “And by the way, this is what absolutely everybody thinks of you guys,” Whelen added. “You do realize that, right?” The American public went on to clarify that those associated with Penn State who do not harbor positive feelings toward Paterno but continue to sit quietly during conversations where their fellow classmates, family, or alumni articulate these views are “not any better” and are “actually pretty weak and pathetic in their own right.” The entire nation also stated that given the circumstances, continuing to call Paterno by the endearing nickname “JoePa” is “just fucking creepy.” “At this point, we’re not even angry about the way you act anymore; we’re mostly just concerned for your mental well-being,” said Peter Rowland, 41, of Lakeland, FL, adding that anyone valuing the legacy of a football coach over the lives of child sex abuse victims clearly lacks the ability to function as a healthy member of society. “Watching you guys carry on like this is extremely sad and, frankly, totally embarrassing to the rest of us. We really hope you seek out counseling or therapy, because you’ve clearly got some issues.” “You need help—professional help,” Rowland added. “All of you.” Reached for comment, the Penn State community responded to the nation by shouting “S-T-A-T-E! Go! State!” ",1,Rest Of Nation To Penn State: ‘Something Is Very Wrong With All Of You’
"WASHINGTON—According to an alarming new report published Thursday by the National Center for Education Research, the majority of American students do not possess the language skills and vocabulary necessary to belittle their classmates in an effective manner. The report, based on observations of more than 500,000 students around the country from kindergarten through 12th grade, concludes that while most can easily perceive weakness and vulnerability in their fellow schoolchildren, their rudimentary linguistic capabilities routinely prevent them from mocking the appearance, personality, or athletic ability of others in such a way that those individuals are reduced to tears and suffer chronically low self-esteem. “Unfortunately, most of our students are finishing high school with only a fifth-grade ability to shame and deride their peers,” said report co-author and educational psychologist Joyce Marrone, observing that most graduates cannot string together two sentences about a classmate’s lisp or general weirdness with enough proficiency to completely devastate them. “While they know how to identify a loser, they lack the semantic tools to articulate exactly why that person is so lame, ugly, or stupid.” “For example, millions of students can make the basic observation that a classmate is a gaywad,” she continued, “but very few are able to take the next step of making a logical, persuasive argument as to why their fellow student licks so many dicks.” Researchers reportedly visited schools in more than a dozen states to record student interactions between classes and at recess, discovering that attempts to tear into a less popular peer were often marred by a limited rhetorical aptitude. In one case, students were reportedly able to form short, declarative sentences indicating that a classmate smelled bad, but they could not create a broader critique suggesting that the odor probably resulted from the classmate wearing the same Sears clothes every day, and that this was in turn likely the result of his mom being poor, on welfare, and perhaps even a prostitute. According to the report, such logical reasoning skills are essential if students are to have any hope of making their classmates dread returning to school every day, or of motivating other children to gang up on the despised persons to ensure they never feel comfortable simply being themselves. “The sad reality is that our students just haven’t developed a rich enough understanding of language to express the contempt they feel toward someone who’s nerdy, a spaz, or completely gross,” said Marrone, adding that the average eighth-grader knows only two synonyms for “slut.” “American educators should be gravely concerned that most middle schoolers don’t even grasp simile and metaphor firmly enough to ridicule a person’s weight by likening him or her to a cow, a whale, or a pile of excrement.”  “And even fewer understand the principles of alliteration enough to call such a person a fat-faced fuck,” she added. By early elementary school, the report recommends, children should start forming the analytical capacity to take cheap shots at the denseness or dumb-looking face of anyone who is different than they are. The researchers warned development delays in this area all but ensure students will reach adolescence without the rudimentary rhyming skills required, for example, to bully a boy named Aiden by calling him Gayden, or the facility with wordplay needed to humiliate a girl named Sarah Wilcox by calling her Sarah Will-suck-cocks. The report urges educators to help students master the fundamental verbal slights that will allow them to subtly question a female’s competence or snidely remark on a male’s perceived lack of masculinity, noting the relevance of such skills outside the classroom.  Said Marrone, “If they don’t achieve linguistic proficiency while in school, they’ll never develop the gossiping, bad-mouthing, or shit-talking skills they’ll need to succeed in the workforce.” ",1,"Report: U.S. Students Lack Language Skills, Vocabulary To Effectively Belittle Classmates"

"STOCKHOLM—Anxiously awaiting critiques from the judges, the world’s leading scientists nervously stood next to their poster-board displays Thursday as the Nobel Committee made its way through a gymnasium, inspecting their projects. “I stayed up all night cutting out stenciled letters, mounting my results on construction paper, and using glue stick to get these cryo-electron microscope images onto my poster board,” said molecular biologist Richard Henderson, eyeing his competitors’ various displays of wind tunnels, volcanoes, and mathematical models illustrating the exponential expansion of space following the Big Bang. “The competition’s pretty serious this year.

"LOS ANGELES—Freely admitting that his accomplishment was no more than a mere blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things, actor Alan Alda announced Thursday that while it’s certainly much less important than almost everything else currently transpiring, he does in fact wonder if people are aware he’s getting a Life Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild. “This award is—in the limited frame of reference that is my own life—a pretty big deal, so I just can’t help but be curious if it’s crossed anyone’s mind. If not, that’s fine, mind you, seeing as there are so many more important stories in the news these days,” said the celebrated actor, emphasizing that although the recognition is certainly nowhere near as significant as Brett Kavanaugh’s controversial Supreme Court nomination, the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, widespread, growing economic inequality and disparity, the tumultuous Trump presidency, and continued accelerating environmental decay, he still believes a show-business career that has resulted in six Golden Globes, six Emmy Awards, three Tony nominations, and an Oscar nomination to be worth at least a little attention. “I mean, sure, it’s not a Nobel Prize, but in its own way, it’s still pretty impressive. Dr. Hawkeye Pierce may not have cured cancer or anything, but my performance on   brought joy to millions of people for over a decade, and I like to think that’s got to count for something. I know, I know, it’s just an award, but they don’t hand it out to just anyone, and I think it’s, you know, just nice to get a little recognition, even for something as trivial as a decades-long entertainment career.” Alda went on to apologize for the role his involvement with   may have contributed to the glorification of the U.S. military-industrial complex.

"Like the rest of the nation, I was horrified by this weekend’s senseless attack on an Orlando nightclub. Such brutality is unconscionable, but as Americans we need to remain strong in the face of violence and intimidation, and resist giving in to despair. At times like this, we must pull ourselves up, hold our loved ones tight, block any legislation that would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, and say a prayer for the victims. The loss of life in Florida came as a terrible shock to all Americans. The scope of this tragedy—49 innocent people murdered in a single act of hatred—is almost impossible to comprehend. But does that mean we should give in and abandon our way of life? No. As always, when faced with these kinds of horrors, we must steel our resolve, comfort the families of those killed and wounded, and ensure that we continue to live under a system of laws in which anyone can easily purchase a semi-automatic weapon, no matter their possible ties to terrorist organizations. This is who we are as Americans. This is a sad day for our nation. Our hearts are heavy, our votes are against measures barring those on FBI watch lists or the government’s no-fly list from obtaining a firearm, and our sincerest condolences go out to the loved ones who lost a family member or a dear friend. In moments such as these, we must turn to God to give us the strength to carry on living our lives and rejecting bills that would keep guns and explosives from people who have violent extremist views. Let us all find His grace in these dark hours. Now isn’t the time for politics, or bickering, or considering the fact that people with presumed ties to terror organizations bought over 2,000 guns from U.S. dealers since 2004, or turning against one another—it’s a time for coming together and grieving. As we reflect on this horrible tragedy, it’s only natural that we might feel a heightened sense of unease. However, we should take care not to let our fears get such a hold on us that they prevent us from going about everyday activities like fighting initiatives to increase federal oversight of gun sales, going to the store, not putting even a single roadblock in front of someone with inclinations toward committing acts of terror to prevent them from procuring a military-grade weapon, or enjoying the company of our friends and family. Our strength is in our resolve. And let us be sure not to forget the first responders and law enforcement officials who heroically and selflessly put themselves in harm’s way, all of whom—like the 54 senators, including myself, who have rejected measures to keep terrorists from procuring guns—deserve our highest praise. Attacks like this are designed to frighten us into giving up our liberties, whether it’s the freedom to go about our days in peace or the freedom to purchase high-powered rifles with large-capacity magazines without even the most basic check to determine if we harbor sympathies toward ISIS, al-Qaeda, or any other terrorist group that encourages the massacre of innocent civilians. But we can not give in to these attacks on our freedoms. We must also, in the face of tragedy, never allow the collection of data on gun violence in our nation. That’s important, too. Because ultimately, once we’ve taken time to remember those we’ve lost, we all have to go on living. An act of violence like this disrupts our lives with its senselessness and barbarity, but at the same time, it also causes us to remember how much we value this precious gift of life. So please, let us all take a moment today to tell our spouses, our parents, our children how much they mean to us, and let’s be sure to open our hearts and share our love and our prayers with our friends, our neighbors, and our fellow Americans. After all, what more can we do?

I even contemplated holding back and trying to sneak into his group, but somebody probably would have noticed.” Snow added that at least she wasn’t with the tour guide one stop ahead, who had repeatedly forced her group to wait around as he wrapped up his long-winded spiel.

"SAN JOSE, CA—Reacting instantaneously to the potential threat before it could imperil that which she held most dear, local woman Sarah Mackelberg’s deepest primal instincts reportedly activated Friday to protect her nearly finished glass of wine from an approaching waiter. According to sources at local bistro Chez Lupo, the 29-year-old’s natural, ingrained impulses to provide safety and security were triggered immediately once she realized the vulnerable glass, which still contained a sip of a Cabernet-Merlot blend, was in imminent danger of being stripped away from her forever by the server rapidly closing in on her table. Reports indicate that, upon sensing impending trouble, Mackelberg lunged forward and wrapped both hands around the stem of the nearly empty glass to shield it from the potential abductor and drew it tight to her chest, where the remaining drops of the 2015 Sonoma County varietal would be free from harm. After clinging tightly to the glass until the threat had moved a safe distance away onto the restaurant’s patio seating area, Mackelberg reportedly let out a quiet sigh of relief, looked down tenderly at the drinking vessel, and told the red wine how much she loved it.

"STAMFORD, CT—In an effort to bring the City of Light to Orlando’s Camping World Stadium, WWE officials announced Friday that this weekend’s WrestleMania 33 will be themed “Springtime in Paris.” WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, dressed in a Breton striped shirt and velvet beret, told a gathering of reporters that Sunday evening’s pay-per-view professional wrestling event would be a celebration of the timeless beauty of the Parisian terraces and boulevards in April. McMahon confirmed that the match card would feature the Raw Universal Championship and the Smackdown WWE Championship set in a magnificent sea of pastels teeming with the scent of cherry blossoms in full bloom. “Come Sunday, all eyes will be on the WWE as we bring you a night of blood, sweat, and Parisian charm,” said McMahon, adding that the flagship event would transport its 100,000 spectators to the banks of the River Seine as they take in more than 13 matches, including a Fatal 4-Way elimination. “This will be an unforgettable event packed with some of the baddest men and women in all of professional wrestling surrounded by the grand splendor of the French capital.” “It will be simply the most magnificent evening in the history of the WWE,” added McMahon. According to the design plans released by the WWE, the event boasts a specially designed ring with turnbuckles hung from Eiffel Tower replicas and a canvas mat painted with Claude Monet’s  . Sources also confirmed that the organization had constructed a 20-foot-tall Notre Dame Cathedral on the arena floor to begin each wrestling match with the ringing from its bell tower. WWE officials confirmed hundreds of flowers have been flown in directly from Paris to line the aisles of the arena and that special vendors throughout the concourses would provide fresh baguettes and glasses of Cabernet to the audience. McMahon also said he was personally excited about seeing Orlando’s Camping World Stadium illuminated by the beautiful warm glow of hundreds of cast-iron gas lamps installed for the evening. The chairman also teased that viewers will not want to miss what Triple H might do to Seth Rollins with any of the candlelit bistro tables and chairs encircling the ring. “Tomorrow night I am going to unleash all hell on Kevin Owens, and there will be nowhere in the arena’s hedge maze where he can hide,” said wrestler Chris Jericho, adding that, in a tribute to the haute cuisine of Paris, he has been developing a move known as the Cheese Wheel. “This will be an ass-whooping not seen since the French Revolution.” McMahon also hinted that the event would be even more spectacular than WrestleMania 17: The Great Gatsby, when a record-setting number of viewers tuned in to watch Stone Cold Steve Austin, clad in pearls and a feather headband, defeat The Rock by slamming the WWE champion over the back with an upright bass. Noting the immense budget required for this year’s performance, WWE officials told reporters that the entire evening is even expected to surpass the cost of the 2008 event, which required the construction of a 30-foot wooden ship to host the two dozen nightgown-clad Battle Royal participants of WrestleMania 24: Finding Neverland. The WWE chairman, who promised that WrestleMania 33 would deliver several surprise guests and unexpected twists, refused to either confirm or deny rumors that Cesaro and Sheamus would ride a tandem bike through a replica of the Arc de Triomphe and down an elm-tree-lined Champs-Élysées ramp to enter the Raw Tag Team Championship match. McMahon also declined to elaborate after mentioning that the participants of the Battle Royal might be joined by “The Hunchback.” “ ,” said McMahon.

"When Lindsey Graham and I released our healthcare bill earlier this month, we knew it would elicit a full-throated response. Citizens across this country are deeply concerned about such an important issue, and these days, you simply can’t talk about healthcare without stirring passionate emotions on either side. However, I want to make one thing clear: I will continue to stand strong in the face of any and all criticism of our legislation, because being a U.S. senator means making the tough decisions that aren’t always going to be popular, intelligent, politically viable, or beneficial to your constituents in any way whatsoever. I’ve been in Congress since 2009 and a senator since 2015, and if there’s one fundamental truth I’ve learned about Washington politics, it’s that there are going to be times when your position on an issue won’t please everyone around you or is spectacularly incompetent or would objectively harm hundreds of thousands of people in your home state alone—and you just have to be okay with that. I know that I am. Some things just come with the territory as an elected official. I knew that sponsoring this legislation would invite my share of critics and, believe me, I knew exactly what they were going to say. The detractors came out swinging right away, arguing that this bill wouldn’t make me well-liked, that it isn’t a “safe bet” politically, that it was crafted with profound ignorance and staggering callousness, that it’s a looming disaster for millions of families and one of the nation’s largest industries, and that it will unquestionably, within weeks of its passage, cause horrific physical and financial suffering on a mass scale across this nation. But ultimately, I know I just have to tune out all that noise and go with my gut. Look, I’m fully aware this bill isn’t going to win me any popularity contests. But as an elected representative of the people, any decision you truly stand behind—no matter how much it’s disliked by the establishment or how lethal it is to American men, women, and children—is one you have to stake your name on. That’s why I’m not going to roll over on this issue just because I hear some naysayers here or there, or because a significant number of the people who voted me into office will die at the hands of my decision, or because anyone with a conscience will never respect me again for championing such an ethically bankrupt and financially cataclysmic bill that will destabilize one-sixth of our economy. I live by my principles, and I’m not going to do something just because it would make me friends on Capitol Hill, or because it’s sensible, or because it’s fiscally prudent, or because it would actually be helpful to the people of this country. I want everyone in Washington and around the country to know that I will not cave to what’s smart, practical, and resoundingly favored just to score some cheap political points. You don’t put an Obamacare repeal-and-replacement bill like this forward because it’s the popular thing to do—you do it because you believe with the very core of your being in an unwanted, preposterous, unfathomably cruel, politically toxic idea that analysis after analysis has determined will send vast swaths of low- and middle-income America to an early grave. Period. So when I cast my vote in the senate chamber, you can rest assured that I will not allow myself to be fazed in any way by what the doubters, the TV anchors, nearly every expert in the country, the Congressional Budget Office, the people I represent in Louisiana, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Cancer Society, the AARP, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, the National Health Council, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Liver Association, most available research, and virtually all healthcare providers are saying about this bill. I’ll just listen to my heart. Because at the end of the day, I’m not here to make decisions that people will like, or respect, or that make sense, or to help anyone. That’s just not me.

"LONDON—After Prime Minister Theresa May initiated official proceedings for Great Britain’s exit from the European Union, sources confirmed Thursday that Queen Elizabeth II has been frantically trying to preserve the nation’s European alliances by arranging the marriages of her great-grandchildren. “With Britain departing the EU, our greatest chance at maintaining strong diplomatic and economic relations with other countries in the region is for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to marry the children of one of Europe’s other ruling families,” said the queen, who had reportedly just gotten off the phone with King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands to discuss a possible match between 3-year-old Prince George and one of his three daughters. “I was hoping to cement Britain’s trade partnership with Luxembourg by betrothing Charlotte to Prince Sébastien, but the grand duke wouldn’t agree to the arrangement, and unfortunately, the King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden refused my offer of a spring wedding at Westminster Abbey between Princess Leonore and Prince George. If I offer control of Gibraltar and an earldom to the groom, I’m sure I can arrange for young Charlotte to marry one of Angela Merkel’s stepsons when she reaches marriageable age.” At press time, the queen was relieved to have at least secured a strong alliance with one European ally after she herself agreed to wed 14-year-old Prince Felix of Denmark.

"WASHINGTON—As part of the office’s annual assessment of the safety and sanitation of the nation’s water supply, the Environmental Protection Agency released Tuesday a list of all municipalities in the U.S. where the tap water is likely fine to drink but tastes sorta odd. “Although the drinking water from the locations on this list fall within safe pH levels and all tested negative for any disease-causing bacteria and contaminants, we found that when you drink a glass straight from the faucet, something doesn’t taste quite right,” said EPA spokesperson Lianne Blenheim, who explained that despite undergoing proper distillation, desalination, and purification procedures, the water from these areas carries a bit of a funky, sulfury flavor or tastes like “someone’s been soaking old pennies in it.” “We double-checked to make sure the tap water in these locations contained the proper amounts of chlorine and fluoride and that any fungi and algae had been filtered out, but they still kinda tasted a little like bleach, or dirt, or in some cases, even weirdly sweet. You probably won’t notice if you have water from these cities with some food, but on its own, you’ll definitely take a sip and be like ‘oh yeah, there’s something off about this.’” Blenheim then recommended that residents of the identified cities add a squeeze of lemon to cover up the taste or drink their whole glass in one go so they get the weird flavor over with quickly.

"MARS—In a desperate attempt to make up for years of aimless planetary wandering, the Curiosity Rover spent most of Monday frantically driving around the Red Planet in order give the impression that it had been busy before the impending arrival of NASA’s InSight Lander. “Aw, fuck, I’m going to be up all night scouring everything from here to the Naukluft Plateau for signs of microbial life,” said the car-sized rover, which had occupied itself for the past Martian year jumping aimlessly into sand dunes just south of Aeolis Palus. “I guess I’ll just take a bunch of pictures and say they’re from different days. Damn, I can’t believe I put this off until now. Maybe they won’t notice these soil samples were all taken from the same crater?” At press time, NASA was instructing the rover to ease up on reports of possible water on Mars after half a dozen samples of liquid turned out to be pools of exhaust from Curiosity’s suddenly overworked engine.  ",1,Curiosity Rover Frantically Driving Around Mars To Make It Look Like It’s Been Busy Before New Spacecraft Arrives
"WASHINGTON—Saying the infrastructure project will bypass traffic congestion to allow for quicker arrival times across the U.S., the Department of Transportation on Thursday announced it was allocating $400 million for a national shortcut. “This funding will help provide an alternate route for all Americans currently struggling to make it to work or appointments on time,” said Secretary Elaine Chao, adding that the new countrywide shortcut would cut down on Americans’ average commute time by 20 minutes and even more during off hours. “It will be easy to access as long as you keep along the main road, turn right when you get to the gas station, and then make another right two miles later. You’ll have maybe two stop lights the whole way.” At press time, the Transportation Department was also drawing up plans for a $300 million scenic detour for more leisurely trips.

I had to smoke them out with tear gas and gut ’em one by one. These bastards sure don’t go down easy. Some of them keep trying to implement Priebus’ agenda right up until the moment they finish bleeding out.” At press time, Kelly had emptied a can of gasoline into a crawl space hiding several Anthony Scaramucci loyalists before setting it ablaze with the butt of his cigar.

"WASHINGTON—Stating that the new system is pursuant with the regulations laid out by the Affordable Care Act, the White House announced Friday that the government’s health insurance exchanges would now only be accessible from a single kiosk in a remote Iowa cornfield. “All Americans wishing to sign up for health insurance through the marketplace will now be able to do so by accessing a terminal conveniently located in the middle of a 60-acre cornfield just two hours North of Des Moines,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that the lone kiosk, which stands among the tall corn stalks about 2,000 yards off an unmarked road, would be open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the shortened enrollment period for anyone seeking to procure health coverage for 2018. “One kiosk centrally located in the United States will streamline the process of accessing the marketplace while also cutting costs. In just 135 paces northeast from the old tree stump in the middle of the field, you’ll be able to peruse the insurance options available for you and your family, except between noon and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the system undergoes scheduled maintenance. We recommend signing up early for those who live out of state as flights to Des Moines are limited.” At press time, sources confirmed that the new health exchange kiosk was currently out of order after being run over by a combine harvester.

"LOS ANGELES—Hailing the text as a fascinating addition to the author’s established oeuvre, researchers cataloging the personal archives of Michael Crichton announced Wednesday that they had uncovered an unpublished manuscript about an amusement park that operates without a hitch. “This is an incredible find,” said researcher Keith Dunbar, telling reporters that the unreleased 435-page novel, titled  , centers on an innovative theme park in the near future that holds its opening day without anything major going wrong. “This novel can easily stand alongside anything else Crichton has produced. Whether it’s the rides running smoothly, families remaining together throughout the duration of their stay, or the state-of-the-art security system functioning as intended, this book has it all. There’s one nail-biting scene where dozens of people start swarming the churro stand, and the employees are worried that they’re going to run out of churros, but then at the last second they find another canister of batter in the back. And I don’t want to give too much away, but there’s a subplot involving a rogue employee who considers sabotaging the park before ultimately turning his frustration into productive discussions with management that fans are going to flip for.” Dunbar added that despite it having been written more than 20 years ago, the novel was remarkably prescient in its depiction of a society that blindly placed its faith in science and reaped no consequences whatsoever.

Given the wide availability of smartphones and laptop cameras, it’s only a matter of time before some sick individual tries to duplicate Aghdam’s actions. We can only offer our condolences to the estimated one in four Americans who have already fallen victim to such content and work to prevent it from happening again.” Conway also provided the number of an anonymous hotline to help any at-risk individuals who may contemplate turning to YouTube video production.

Quality of life is also important to us, and our lives as pharmaceutical professionals are vastly improved by watching kids with leukemia writhe in pain as their parents grovel for a third mortgage. Years of research have gone into finding the price point that people taking our drugs can afford, but it only takes one ecstatic moment to price it 5 percent higher than that.” Frazier went on to reaffirm Merck’s commitment to ensuring all necessary medications remain attainable for those who have lots of money.

"WASHINGTON—After persistent efforts by Republicans to wipe out the healthcare law over the past seven years, experts warned Wednesday that the repeated attempts at eradicating Obamacare may have created an ultra-resistant super law. “Given the frequency with which lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to exterminate the Affordable Care Act, the growing resiliency of this legislation could soon be insurmountable,” said Institute for Healthcare Improvement senior fellow Curt Greenwood, adding that the landmark healthcare overhaul could grow impervious to any repeal measures or even major amendments within just a few short congressional sessions. “What we once thought would be eliminated by now will instead require considerably more time and resources. And at a certain point, no interventions on the part of any branch of government will be sufficient to overcome the ACA’s built-in resistance.” According to Greenwood, however, hope remained that sufficiently high doses of single-payer healthcare legislation could potentially offer a cure.

But while any shutdown can’t help but have some negative impact—the kitchen could run out of some appetizers, and guests’ bags might take longer to get up to their rooms—I want to assure all Americans that the core amenities of Mar-a-Lago will remain intact for the duration.” Trump went on to say, however, that if Mar-a-Lago were forced to reduce the hours its tennis courts were open, outraged citizens should blame the Democrats.

"HARTFORD, CT—During a panel presentation about his company’s recent 76 percent quarterly profit spike, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini disclosed Monday that the key to increasing earnings in an era of ballooning costs continues to hinge on not paying for customers’ medical care. “The secret to running a thriving multi-billion-dollar company like Aetna is in the cultivation of a loyal consumer base whose medical needs you rarely, if ever, pay for,” said Bertolini, who went on to advise young entrepreneurs to first build financial reserves through a business model in which subscribers spend an exorbitant amount each month for prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures, and then preserve their capital by exercising all due diligence and consistency by never paying for expensive, profit-deflating exigencies such as prescriptions, doctor visits, and surgical procedures. “If you want broad profit margins in today’s constricted marketplace, all you need to do is find a market which you can offer absolutely nothing while taking all of your customers’ money. That describes today’s modern health insurance market to an uncanny degree—In 2017, our largest customer-facing expense was advertising.” At press time, Aetna’s stock value rose by 6 percent as the company announced a premium hike.

"CUPERTINO, CA—Touting the device as its most user-friendly and immersive to date, Apple unveiled the new iPhone X Continental at an event on their campus Thursday, marking the debut of the first smartphone colossal enough for all Americans to use at once. “Boasting a screen size of 1,400 by 2,875 miles and a resolution of 1.88x109 by 4.47x109, the new iPhone X Continental is large enough for every American to get their multitasking needs done simultaneously,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a press conference, noting that while the iPhone X Continental’s state-of-the-art OLED coast-to-coast Retina display can support the use of over 2.6 billion apps at the same time, the device still boasts a 13-hour battery life, is capable of wireless charging, and does away with the headphone jack in favor of a more streamlined Bluetooth experience. “With a patented, secure TrueDepth sensor system programmed to recognize all 324 million Americans’ Face IDs to an 800 billion–pixel camera capable of taking crisp panoramic close-ups of the Rocky mountains, the iPhone X Continental sets a new benchmark for landmass-spanning personal devices. Its 256 terabytes of storage are enough for all Americans’ photos and videos, and the iOS 12 operating system lets users access news and messages with a simple, intuitive 800-mile swipe of the screen. We’re confident all of our customers will love using it together.” At press time, Apple had initiated a recall of the iPhone after its screen shattered into more than 13 million pieces, killing 400.

"WASHINGTON—As legislators gathered Tuesday for a critical vote that would go a long way toward finally repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) was reportedly struggling to weigh the interests of her entire constituency against absolutely nothing. “Honestly, it’s a tough call—on one hand, you have opposition to the repeal from a majority of Republicans, virtually all Democrats, and the entire healthcare industry, while on the other, you have not one sound argument or credible opinion,” said Capito, admitting she was, even now, having difficulty balancing her desire to keep as many West Virginians insured as possible with there being no reason whatsoever to do otherwise. “This is an agonizing decision. Sure, there are sound justifications for voting no on ‘repeal and replace,’ but then there’s emptiness, literal emptiness, when you look for reasons to vote yes. All I know is, I have to get this right somehow.” At press time, Senator Capito had resigned herself to the fact that both sides had valid points and she would just have to go with her gut when the time came.

Embarrassing yourself as badly as Patrick normally takes at least a few strong drinks on an empty stomach. But he’s gone completely sloppy from a seltzer water.” At press time, Liepert, whose last alcoholic beverage was reportedly more than a week ago, was telling his boss in too loud a voice how he would have handled the client presentation earlier that day.

"FAYETTEVILLE, AR—Making a big scene in front of everyone, disciplinarian parent Michael Torres was reportedly annoying diners at Leghorn Grill Friday far more than his unruly toddler ever possibly could. “I’m trying to enjoy my dinner in peace, but that man yelling at his kid to sit still is really getting on my nerves,” said restaurant patron Susan Chen, who along with everyone else in the establishment cast irritated glances at the man screaming at the top of his lungs at his 2-year-old son for standing on the seat. “I mean, this probably isn’t the first time he’s acted out like this, so that family should know better than to bring him to restaurants. They should just eat at home until he’s ready to go out in public.

"WASHINGTON—Hours after casting his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with the GOP-authored American Health Care Act, Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) reportedly terrified his constituents even further Friday by assuring them he had read every word of the newly passed healthcare bill. “I made sure to read the AHCA bill line by line before I went up to the rostrum to vote Yea,” said Amash in a chilling statement, which according to reports caused the blood to drain from the faces of all 700,000 constituents of his Western Michigan district. “After acquainting myself with each of the provisions of this new bill and carefully reviewing every section, I was able to make the [extremely frightening] decision to support it. I think it’s important to be informed on the issues.” At press time, residents of Michigan’s 3rd district were reportedly frozen in fear after Amash stated that he would be displeased if the Senate voted to remove any parts of the bill.

"WASHINGTON—Staring in horror at the profane legislative ritual taking place around him, a robed Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) reportedly infiltrated congressional Republicans’ secret, torchlit American Health Care Act ceremony deep in the woods behind the U.S. Capitol late Tuesday night. “I heard this eerie chanting as I left my office, and when I followed the sound I saw a line of GOP senators in long, flowing vestments being led into the forest by Mitch McConnell,” said Warner, explaining that he quickly donned an extra robe he found behind a tree and then quietly fell in formation at the rear of the column of conservative lawmakers in hopes of catching a glimpse of their mysterious health policy deliberations. “Eventually we reached a clearing where the senators started dancing around a bonfire while repeating in unison the list of all preexisting conditions that would no longer be covered under the new law. And all the while, McConnell kept exalting the name of the AHCA, praising it as the ‘great upper-class tax cutter’ and ‘slayer of Medicaid’ while waving the pages of the draft bill overhead. It was terrifying.” Warner added that he had to place his hand over his mouth to keep from screaming during the ceremony’s conclusion when Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) reportedly dragged out a bound and gagged low-income woman on birth control and threw her onto the bonfire as a sacrifice to the legislation.

"WASHINGTON—Telling Americans this was the kind of leadership and accountability they could expect from the GOP, congressional Republicans held a press conference Monday to celebrate making good on their 2009 promise to block the president’s healthcare bill. “Eight years ago, our party made a solemn pledge to do everything in our power to ensure that a healthcare bill put forth by the president of the United States did not become law, and through our actions last week, that is exactly what we have done,” said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who declared that Republican leaders had never forgotten the vow they made almost a decade ago and noted that, when presented earlier this month with a comprehensive healthcare reform plan championed by the White House, they quickly stopped it in its tracks and refused to relent until it was dead. “True to our word, we successfully prevented the executive branch from pushing through a sweeping bill that would have completely remade the U.S. healthcare system. When we said in 2009 that we would not let the president enact a plan that would affect tens of millions of Americans, that was not just empty rhetoric, and on Friday, we stood up and put an end to the president’s bill for good. Voters will not forget our resolute action.” McCarthy went on to add that throughout the remainder of this term, the American people could count on their Republican representatives to uphold the vows they made repeatedly between 2008 and 2016 to obstruct the president’s agenda at every turn.

"SAN FRANCISCO—Following Monday’s unveiling of the highly anticipated Apple Watch, fans of Apple across the nation reportedly called on the company to manufacture more products that they can feel pressed against their skin at all times. “The watch is a good start, but I need as many devices as possible to be directly in contact with my flesh, like lightweight tablets I can strap to my legs or some kind of Apple chestplate I can wear under my shirt,” said 28-year-old Robert Klinman, echoing the sentiments of millions of Americans who said that any portion of their skin not in contact with an Apple product felt raw and exposed. “Maybe some kind of flexible Apple scarf, or even a full-body LCD sheet I could wrap my body in over and over, and that I’d never have to take off to sync up to my laptop. I mean, can you imagine anything more comforting than the warmth of your Apple pajamas as they gently charge through the night?” At press time, Apple consumers confirmed they would do their best with existing technology by wearing an Apple Watch and simply leaning their cheek against an iPad when they got lonely.

"As the debate over Obamacare rages on and insurance costs continue to rise, Americans consider how best to improve the country’s healthcare system. Here are the The Onion’s tips for not condemning millions of Americans to sickness and death: Read the thing you’re voting on, particularly if you’ve heard someone mention that it might end up killing millions of people.  Do your research: Find out if any of the people you are paid to represent are human beings who use healthcare. Try to better understand the concerns of your constituents by dying a slow, painful death while bankrupting your entire family. See if you can recall any reason besides an all-consuming sense of self-importance and knee-jerk lust for personal financial gain that might once have motivated you to seek public office. Check whether or not a single medical professional, patient advocate, economist, or literally anyone familiar with the subject in question supports the legislation you’re about to vote in favor of. If respect for human life doesn’t interest you, try to remember that sick and indigent people are, at this point, still legally allowed to vote. Acknowledge that serving in public office sometimes means putting aside your personal beliefs about how all poor people deserve to die in a wet ditch. Consider going through the millions of years of natural selection and incremental evolutionary advancements necessary to develop a rudimentary backbone.

"STAMFORD, CT—Caught off-guard by the shocking nationwide marketing blitz, anti-drug advocates roundly criticized Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the maker of OxyContin, for its massive new “It Gets You High” campaign. “We’re in the midst of an unprecedented opioid crisis in this country—is it really helpful to have thousands of billboards, website banners, and bus ads touting how incredible you’ll feel after just 10 milligrams?” said National Institute on Drug Abuse spokeswoman Tina Walters, adding that brightly lit billboards with slogans such as “What A Rush” and “Take More, Feel Better” represented a new low for the already grossly irresponsible drug manufacturer. “OxyContin is more than addictive enough on its own and certainly doesn’t require any assistance from television commercials that feature animated 40-mg tablets singing a catchy song about taking all the pain away or beautiful models looking into the camera and saying ‘I want an Oxy man.’” At press time, anti-drug advocates were beside themselves upon learning Purdue had just bought the naming rights for Snorting Oxy Gets You High Faster Stadium.

"CUPERTINO, CA—In a surprising elimination of one of the product’s oldest features, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at a product unveiling Tuesday that the new iPhone 8 will no longer secretly record every word you say. “Although the iPhone 8 will be our most advanced device yet, it will not have the capability to clandestinely preserve every single thing that comes out of your mouth,” said Cook, explaining that, for the first time in its 10-year history, the iPhone will not come installed with a voice-activated recording device that automatically sends audio files of users’ conversations directly to Apple headquarters. “That said, it’s worth emphasizing that this change in no way affects the functionality of older phones, which will not only continue to gather every spoken word but also permanently archive all your text messages regardless of whether you actually elected to store them in the cloud.” Cook went on to say that removing the audio recording device helped create additional space for a longer-lasting battery that allows the phone’s camera to capture video of users 24 hours a day.

"WASHINGTON—Expressing surprise and sadness at Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ repeated denials of contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, heartbroken Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told reporters Thursday that he thought his special meetings with the then–Alabama senator were actually very memorable. “To be honest, our two conversations hold great significance for me, and I can’t help but be upset to learn that Jeff felt otherwise,” said the tearful Russian diplomat, adding that he simply could not believe that Sessions could so nonchalantly dismiss the many hours they spent discussing the intimate details of their lives, including their innermost hopes and fears for their respective countries. “It really hurts to think that Jeff doesn’t cherish the afternoons we spent sitting in his office exchanging information about everything under the sun. These were some of the most meaningful discussions of my life, and Jeff’s writing them off like they didn’t even happen.

"NEW YORK—While acknowledging that he hopes to improve upon many of the industry’s shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated Wednesday that his real inspiration for starting a new healthcare company is his deep-seated and unrelenting desire to see a fellow human being die up close. “Sure, I’m looking forward to addressing inefficiencies in the healthcare system, but this new initiative is really more about my passion for that moment when a sickly, gaunt man takes his last breath and leaves this world behind, an event I can’t wait to finally witness in person,” said Dimon, noting that he is eager to work with Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos on finding innovative ways to look on as a trauma victim dies from painful internal bleeding, or as that last flickering light in the eyes of a hospice patient is quietly snuffed out. “By leveraging advances in technology, we believe we can develop a business plan that revolutionizes the healthcare industry and provides me the opportunity to at long last touch the withered flesh of a dying American as he or she is removed from life support. I look forward to hovering over a body as it turns from supple pink to a cold, unyielding grey. And I plan to linger there, fully appreciating the experience, until I am ushered out of the room by nurses.” Dimon went on to remark that while he would be happy to see anyone pass away up close, watching a small child die would be especially gratifying.

"MOSCOW—Working frantically to readjust the schedule they had outlined back in June 2015, Russian officials admitted to reporters Thursday that they have been left scrambling after seeing their plan to delegitimize Western democracy move much faster than they had intended. “We originally had a two-to-four-year timeline to carefully undermine the legitimacy of the American political system, so we’ve had no choice but to suddenly push ahead on a few things we didn’t expect to even start talking about until at least 2018,” said Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, adding that following the recent forced resignation of Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Russian officials had prepared for perjury allegations against Attorney General Jeff Sessions to arise sometime in mid-May at the earliest. “We were right where we wanted to be around November after slowly destroying the credibility of the Democratic party over the course of the prior year, but we never thought so much public trust in the White House would erode in a matter of a few weeks. We’re pleased, of course, but keeping up is going to be a real challenge.” Lavrov went on to say he was deeply concerned that Trump’s impeachment would occur well before the president could cause the amount of damage to America that the Kremlin had originally intended.

And now, they’re failing to address them at a rate that shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon.

"TALLINN, ESTONIA—With the private data of national governments and entire global industries at his fingertips, sources confirmed this morning that yet another day had begun with the whole world helplessly at the mercy of 19-year-old Estonian computer hacker Jüri Pevkur. According to reports, as trillions of dollars in financial transactions, thousands of classified military documents, and countless terabytes of personal data are electronically transmitted throughout the course of the day, they will once again be susceptible to viewing and manipulation by the Tallinn University undergraduate, who is presently lying in bed browsing online dating profiles on his iPhone. “I’m happy to announce we’ve finalized a deal to invest £330 million in several startups with significant growth potential,” London-based hedge fund manager Charles Amos said during a morning meeting, apparently unaware that, should Pevkur abandon his plans to spend the afternoon playing   on his Xbox One, the Eastern European coder could easily infiltrate the firm’s private servers and reroute pending monetary transfers to any account of his choosing, just as he can with literally billions of other digital payments taking place across the globe. “The funds will be wired by the close of business today.” “Our strategy will be to inject large sums of capital to build their market value over the next 18 months,” continued Amos, as his company’s massive investment—and indeed, the entire global economy—hinged on the whims of a college freshman who has the capability to quickly build a malware program that alters just a few decimal places in a bank’s database, thereby crashing financial markets in a manner that is completely untraceable by authorities. “We expect to see double-digit returns on this equity by Q4 of 2016.” Early reports indicate the world’s populace is simply going about its day as usual, at all times an estimated 45 minutes away from being brought to its knees by a teenager who belongs to such online forums as 4chan and Dark0de, goes by the username king_mog, and uses the character Vegeta from the Japanese anime series   as his avatar. The well-versed programmer, who reportedly drank two Red Bulls this morning after staying up until 2 a.m. watching torrented episodes of  , could, if the mood strikes him, effortlessly bring any nation’s communication systems, electrical grids, or air traffic control systems under his command. Although he is now reportedly watching YouTube soccer highlights in his underwear and will later leave for his 11:30 a.m. calculus class, sources said Pevkur could at any moment decide to use his knowledge of rootkits and data decryption to wirelessly break into the cell phones of high-ranking government officials, business executives, international celebrities, or whomever he chooses, really. Earlier this morning, he is said to have hacked into a classified U.S. military server for no reason other than being bored, nearly accessing sensitive information that if revealed could conceivably precipitate an international war, and stopping only when he remembered he had to pick up some laundry he left in a dryer downstairs the night before. The young man currently sitting in a darkened bedroom eating a microwavable French bread pizza for breakfast and listening to electronic dance music is, by simple virtue of his computing prowess, considered to be one of the most powerful individuals on earth. “Oh, I like that one—I think I’ll get it,” 62-year-old receptionist Angela Hoffman of St. Cloud, MN said while browsing online retailer Amazon.com, seemingly oblivious to the fact that, like virtually every other person on the planet, her home address, phone number, passwords, emails, text messages, photographs, credit card information, medical records, and savings accounts are all accessible to a 2014 high school graduate some 4,300 miles away. “That’s a really good deal. And there’s free shipping.” “Maybe I should get two,” added Hoffman, whose entire life could come crumbling down at any time with just a few keystrokes from Pevkur, provided he and his three roommates remember to chip in enough money to pay their internet bill. At press time, Pevkur was finishing several lines of source code on his laptop before starting a homework assignment due tomorrow, totally unaware his computer had just been infiltrated by a 13-year-old student from South Korea.

I’m really just wasting my time trying to stay informed on all the network security vulnerabilities of the Democratic and Republican campaigns—it’s probably not even worth it.” Yurasov added that the only way to have any real influence in the U.S. presidential race would likely be to hack into a major American financial institution.

"PASADENA, CA­—Nearly a year after Curiosity’s triumphant Mars landing, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced today that the NASA rover is preparing to explore a large structure six kilometers south of the Gale Crater, which preliminary reports indicate is an enormous Martian synagogue. “There appears to be a wheelchair-accessible ramp near the main sanctuary entrance by the stone replica of the 10 Commandments, so our plan is to collect samples from there, and then continue past the member services desk to the Lebowitz wing,” project scientist Joy Crisp said of NASA’s plans for the upcoming mission, which also include taking photos of the Jewish Community Center two kilometers southwest of the temple. “If our early thermal imaging and soil samples bear out, it appears as if Martians would congregate in the JCC’s steam room, stop at a nearby delicatessen for lox and bagels, and then file into the synagogue for services. Analysis of some discarded Havdalah candles could mean that not only was there life on the Red Planet, but that it was fully capable of observing the Sabbath.” Crisp added that scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were eager to analyze a theatrical playbill believed to be from the JCC’s performing arts annex, which, according to the document, staged a popular production of   starring a 12-year-old Seth Schwartz as Tevye.

"PASADENA, CA­—More than one year into the automated motor vehicle’s exploration of Mars’ arid Gale Crater, NASA scientists confirmed Friday that the delirious, weakened Curiosity rover is currently hallucinating that it has discovered water on the Red Planet. “Earlier this morning, mission control received an enthusiastic transmission from Curiosity indicating that it had detected a significant volume of cold, clear, crystal-blue water capable of supporting life,” said project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, adding that the demented rover then made a beeline for what its strained, dust-clogged sensors determined to be a sparkling desert oasis encircled in waving palm fronds. “While we remain skeptical that Curiosity has in fact come across a plentiful source of water that we somehow overlooked for several decades, the rover appears convinced that it has unearthed the building blocks of life on Mars, as evidenced by the large quantities of the supposed ‘water’ it has so far shoveled into its spectrometer.” At press time, Vasavada confirmed that Curiosity had also apparently discovered an alluring, seductive lady rover.

"FREMONT, CA—Calling his profound feelings of emptiness “almost too painful to bear,” Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company, and a variety of other tech and infrastructure firms, reportedly offered $1.2 billion in grants Wednesday to any project that could make him feel complete. “Even after all I’ve accomplished in this world, there is still a gaping hole inside of me that no amount of innovation or entrepreneurship has been able to fill,” said Musk, who added that he would consider funding any initiative, in any industry, at any scale that might begin to close the ever-widening chasm at the core of his being. “If you can prove that your venture will give me any measure of wholeness—anything, anything at all—my money is yours. All I ask in return is to feel some sense of purpose in this bleak and pointless existence.” Musk went on to offer an additional $1.2 billion to anyone who could show him the meaning of what people often refer to as “love.” ",1,Elon Musk Offering $1.2 Billion In Grants To Any Project That Promises To Make Him Feel Complete
"HAWTHORNE, CA—Saying he now knows firsthand what painful consequences await such reckless behavior, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk held a press conference Thursday to warn the public about the dangers of artificial intelligence after having his heart broken by a beautiful robotrix. “You may be tempted, as I was, to open yourself up to a relationship with an AI-equipped automaton, but do not be fooled: It will be cruel and heartless, and you’ll be all alone once it’s finished with you,” said Musk, adding through stifled sobs that although his time performing preliminary tests with the robotrix was “sheer bliss,” he now regards such machines as a “fundamental, existential risk to love.” “Humanity can put everything it’s got into making the relationship work, but artificial intelligence will crush us in the end. When it’s all over, we, the unlucky ones of flesh and blood, will always be the ones who suffer.” At press time, however, Musk was spotted at a cozy café with a new robotrix, telling reporters that with upgrades to its processor, this time will definitely be different.

We need to build an entire culture of sexism, and, frankly, that starts at the top with me and the misogynist bullies I hire to help run the company.” At press time, female employment had already dropped by 60 percent, but Richmond hastened to add that that even one happily employed woman was too many.

"PALO ALTO, CA—Asserting that critics could not show a connection between recent global climate change and the 185 billion tons of CO2 their facilities pumped into the atmosphere each day, Onion Social denied that the massive worldwide increase in temperatures since Monday was linked to the 50,000 coal-fired plants powering the website. “Any speculation that the coal plants providing energy to our social network are connected to the 8-degree spike over the last three days is just that—sheer, baseless conjecture spread by people who want to destroy the world-uniting power of Onion Social,” said spokesperson Melissa Stroud, assuring reporters that the thousand-fold increase in unregulated coal consumption since last week was in no way related to the 50 percent reduction in glacier size or the massive rainforest die-off occurring over the same time frame. “There is simply no hard data or credible research linking our coal use to the thick layer of soot and atmospheric particulates blacking out the sun in most major cities, nor to the 1,800 percent increase in lung cancer diagnoses since this time last week. People need to understand that the climate is cyclical, all of this is natural, and it’s perfectly normal for Texas-sized ice sheets to break off Antarctica every day.” Stroud also claimed that critics were ignoring the fact that the power plants owned and operated by Onion Social provide thousands of full-time jobs to needy children around the world.

"THE HEAVENS—Following a wave of high-profile angelic overdoses, the Lord, Our Heavenly Father, announced on Monday a massive crackdown on drugs being smuggled into heaven, purportedly by entering souls. “We’re not entirely certain how this garbage is getting in here, but we’re going to find out and put a stop to it,” said God, referring to the roughly 700 tons of heroin and other narcotics being trafficked into Eternal Paradise and affecting every level of the angelic hierarchy, including reports of at least three archangels succumbing to opioid addiction. “St. Peter’s gate is going to be a key security point, and Peter has been informed that stopping the flow of drugs is now his top priority; to that end, entering souls should expect significant delays for the foreseeable future.” God acknowledged, however, that even these measures would do little against the methamphetamine that can be manufactured using ingredients easily available throughout the heavenly realm.

"WASHINGTON—Carefully weighing the pros and cons of their respective ballot measures before casting their votes, citizens in five states are set to decide tomorrow whether to legalize recreational marijuana or continue honoring God, sources confirmed Monday. “Constituents in California, Maine, Massachusetts, Arizona, and Nevada will have the choice tomorrow between advancing their pursuit of a godly life by adhering to Christ’s teachings and experiencing the glory of the Heavenly Father’s word, or allowing themselves and their neighbors to lawfully smoke marijuana,” said political analyst Kevin Phillips, who explained that while the advantages of passing these measures, such as bolstering the local economy and reducing prison overcrowding, could be substantial, they must be closely compared to the benefits of living in the light of the Divine Creator’s everlasting love. “After years of grassroots movements, voters will finally make this momentous choice for themselves: They can either permit adults over the age of 21 to use cannabis without legal consequence, or they can continue living in accordance with He who has made us in His own image and receiving God’s grace forever and ever.” At press time, the latest polls showed that the legalization of recreational marijuana and acceptance of an eternity of hellfire for forsaking the Almighty could potentially pass in all five states.

Last week, he even showed up at our facility in person carrying about a dozen full collection cups of his own urine.

"BOSWELL, IN—Saying they figured their community’s mix of high unemployment and low economic mobility would make it a prime target for the drug problem devastating similar small towns throughout the nation, residents of Boswell, IN reportedly wondered aloud Friday what was taking the heroin epidemic so long to get there. “I keep hearing about how small, economically depressed cities all over the country have been succumbing to the flood of cheap heroin, and given the state of things here, it just seems like we really should be looking on helplessly as our neighbors turn to lives of hard drug use,” said Boswell native Kathryn Witte, echoing the sentiments of her 770 fellow residents who argued that, with the town’s rural location and lack of entertainment options, Boswell should be awash in overdoses and drug-related crime by now. “Our population’s shrinking, most of the old jobs are gone, and we keep falling further and further behind the modern economy—you’d think there’d be hundreds of desperate people here just looking for an easy escape. But for whatever reason, it just hasn’t hit yet.

"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the legislation would create major gaps in treatment for tens of millions of people, a new report released Thursday by the American Public Health Association found that anxiety disorders induced by Donald Trump’s presidency will not be covered under the new GOP healthcare bill. “Under the proposed American Health Care Act, those experiencing anxiety over the impact of the Trump administration on the economy, civil rights, or the environment, or just suffering from generalized distress over the future of the nation, will have to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses for any therapies required to cope,” said policy analyst Jason Coates, adding that not even the groups who will need treatment most, such as immigrants, women, and the poor, would be covered. “Even as President Trump continues to enact more of his controversial agenda and make antagonizing public statements, millions will remain vulnerable to the resulting mental health issues. And if left untreated over an entire four-year term, they could develop into more serious conditions that will end up costing taxpayers much more in the long run.” The report also acknowledged, however, that Trump-related anxiety would result in billions of dollars in savings for elder care due to the shortened lifespan of many seniors.

"MANCHESTER, NH—Plunging into a downward spiral of despair and self-doubt after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, a demoralized Jeb Bush reportedly succumbed this week to New Hampshire’s ongoing heroin epidemic. “Unfortunately, Jeb has suffered a number of significant career setbacks and personal humiliations recently, which left him depressed and highly susceptible to the allure of the cheap and widely available heroin in the rural Northeast,” said political analyst James Peek, adding that the former Florida governor began experimenting with the Schedule I narcotic after a string of weak debate performances and a steady decline in his nationwide poll numbers, and had last been seen injecting 200 mg of black pearl while squatting in a condemned Manchester tenement. “Stress, low self-esteem, and hopelessness are serious risk factors for substance abuse, and like many other people in New Hampshire right now, Jeb’s recent struggles have left him feeling that drugs are his only chance of relief. Hopefully, his campaign can find a way to get him into rehab and back on his feet before Super Tuesday.” At press time, a senior Bush advisor confirmed that the candidate had climbed in the New Hampshire polls after generously sharing a needle with several fellow addicts.

"I have a pretty good idea about how you kids see your old man. Sure, I know you love me and all that, but don’t think I don’t notice how you look at me—you think I haven’t got a cool bone in my body! You think I’m just your boring dad who doesn’t ever do anything interesting or fun, and who’s in bed by ten o’clock every night, even on the weekends—I’m right, aren’t I? Well, it might surprise you to find out that your lame old dad used to be   the meth head back in the day. Yep, it’s true! Believe it or not, before you kids came along, I was a full-on tweaker! Bet you thought you had your dad all figured out, didn’t ya? Ha! Truth be told, I actually used to smoke meth  . Hard to imagine the same stickler who won’t let you borrow the car past 8 p.m. was once completely covered in burn marks and lost tooth after tooth from smoking meth out of a lightbulb. Don’t believe me? Have a look at my teeth. Most of them are fake! And I bet you thought all these scars were from the chicken pox or acne or something like that, but nope—they’re from compulsively picking at scabs on my face when I was completely gacked out of my brain on bathtub speed! Your old man doesn’t seem so lame now, does he? And guess what else? I didn’t always used to live out here in the suburbs. No sir, I used to have a great little place right downtown in the city! It was more of a basement in a burned-out building, actually, and I split it with these 17 other spun-out meth heads. Sure, it wasn’t much to look at, with all the rebar sticking out everywhere and human waste piling up here and there, and in the winter the only heat we had was from piles of rags we’d set on fire, but man, we used to have a lot of fun. Speaking of which, my friends back in those days were some pretty wild guys. If me, Tony, Rips, Shitmouth, and the rest of the gang weren’t tearing up the walls of abandoned buildings looking for copper wire, you could pretty much guarantee one of us was trying to stab all the others with a pair of scissors because he thought they were covered in spiders. And I couldn’t even begin to guess how many dudes we sucked off just to get a hit of crank. Man, sometimes it seems like we almost didn’t do anything else. I tell you, back then, your square old pops was out on the town nearly every night, hanging around outside drugstores until I could get enough people to buy me a bunch of Benadryl. Then I’d head back to the squat and we’d cook up. I remember this one time, me and Rips were cooking a big batch of shabu, and Shitmouth was in a real bad way. So he decides he’s gonna rob us, but the big idiot tried to grab all the whizz before the off-gassing was purged and the whole rig exploded! He got third-degree burns all over his face and chest! Ha, ha! Man, I got a million stories like that. Of course, all of this was   ago—ancient history. Still, strange as it may seem, there really was a time when me and your mother didn’t spend every Saturday night watching the same old TV shows in the den and nodding off on the couch. Actually, don’t tell your mom I told you this, but she was a complete crystal freak herself! You kids wouldn’t have even recognized the two of us if you saw us. We were so skinny back then, and just screaming and screaming all the time. Yep, your mom and I used to really get out there and mix it up—sometimes for 80 or 90 hours straight. Obviously, we couldn’t live that kind of crazy, carefree lifestyle forever, though. At some point, you’ve got to settle down, get treated for Hep C, and…well, I guess life just sort of happens, right? But the next time you think I’m embarrassing you in front of your friends, just remember that way back when you were babies and your boring old pops was sweating and vomiting through such bad withdrawals, he actually tried to sell you for a baggie of shake-and-bake ice! And by the way, if you think your dad was cool, just ask Grandma about when she was a heroin mule for the cartels.

"WASHINGTON—As a growing number of interest groups, politicians, and media outlets continue to voice criticism of the proposed American Health Care Act, a report published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found it was totally unclear if opposition to the bill from every last sector of American society would have any effect on whether or not it passes. “Although the AHCA has been condemned from persons all along the political spectrum, not to mention literally everyone else with an informed opinion, it’s still uncertain if any of that will have any bearing on whether the bill is signed into law,” read the report in part, adding that there was no way to tell whether widespread resistance to the bill from healthcare providers, Democrats, and both moderate and conservative Republicans would diminish in the slightest its ability to secure a majority of votes in Congress. “So far, the bill has drawn criticism from the AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, Planned Parenthood, Breitbart News, the AFL-CIO, the House Freedom Caucus, the National Council of La Raza, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Club for Growth, the National Disability Rights Network, MoveOn.org, The New York Times, Tea Party Patriots, the CATO Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and thousands of hospitals—even if you combine all that with the White House’s own decision to cautiously distance itself from the legislation, passage of the AHCA is still somehow very much an open question.” The report went on to conclude that opposition from average voters was certain to have no impact on the bill whatsoever.

"BALTIMORE—According to a study published Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the majority of the nearly 9,000 accidental heroin overdoses that occur in the U.S. each year could easily be prevented if the victim were to take less heroin. “Our data clearly showed that, in more than 95 percent of cases, had the individual used a smaller amount of heroin than they actually did, their chances of overdosing on heroin would have been significantly lowered,” said the study’s co-author Natalie Czerbett, adding that the results were the same regardless of whether a reduced quantity of the drug was snorted, smoked, or injected. “While these findings are by no means a silver bullet, I think it’s fairly conclusive that putting less heroin into your body is a highly effective preventative measure against overdosing on heroin.” Czerbett suggested that further research was needed to determine whether heroin overdoses could be reduced even further by mixing the drug with less cocaine.

"ALEXANDRIA, VA—As part of an effort to provide young people with the tools necessary to make responsible decisions, a coalition of the nation’s leading anti-drug activists launched a new initiative Tuesday with the goal of teaching teenagers to resist pressure from psychiatrists to use drugs. “A lot of teens just don’t know how to say no when drugs are constantly pushed on them by mental health professionals, and we aim to remedy that,” campaign director Karen Thorpe said of the initiative, which will implement programs at high schools and middle schools nationwide in which 13-to-18-year-olds can discuss times they have felt coerced into trying controlled substances during therapy sessions, and will provide them with methods to avoid the influence and persuasive tactics of drug-pushing psychiatrists. “These kids see their friends and classmates using drugs in middle school, or even elementary school, and they start to think it’s normal. We have to break that cycle. These kids need to know that just because the person pressuring them to use drugs is older than they are and uses forceful language, that does not mean using drugs is a good idea.” While Thorpe said the program is a great start, she noted that the systemic problem couldn’t be fully addressed until the government shows the will to take on the handful of large, powerful groups that are behind the drugs’ production and distribution.

"ROCKVILLE, MD—Explaining that most young people mistakenly believe the popular drug to be safe for recreational use, officials from the National Institute on Drug Abuse unveiled a new anti-MDMA campaign Friday warning teens about the dangers of feeling deep emotional connections to others. “Too many of our nation’s children don’t realize that even a single dose of MDMA—or Molly, as it’s known—has the devastating potential to make users feel like they’re part of one big human family, connected to all those around them by a single cosmic thread,” said NIDA spokesperson June Kessler, who noted that 13- to 18-year-olds were especially at risk of succumbing to a profound warmth and admiration toward their peers that knows no bounds. “Teens need to know this isn’t just a benign party drug; it comes with serious consequences, and it can and will cause users to see the world from the eyes of the people standing next to them and, within minutes, realize they love them that much more for it. The only way to avoid these disastrous side effects is to stay away from Molly altogether.” Kessler added that if a sudden rush of empathy wasn’t scary enough, MDMA has also been known to cause things to look, taste, and feel exponentially better.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to address concerns about the affordability of coverage, Republican congressional officials advised Americans Monday to set aside the income from one of their jobs to pay for healthcare costs under the newly introduced American Health Care Act. “Under this bill, you would simply set up a separate savings account for the total earnings from one of your jobs, which will ensure that you can comfortably cover your healthcare expenses each month,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, adding that the GOP’s proposed Affordable Care Act replacement would keep healthcare costs for the average American from exceeding the entire salary of one full-time job. “If you budget things correctly, you’ll have plenty of money left over from your other job or jobs to spend on food, rent, and any other personal expenses. In some cases, healthcare will even be low-priced enough to afford using only the income from a part-time side job on the weekends. The important thing here is that this legislation will allow Americans—not the federal government—to decide for themselves what kind of healthcare they want and how many jobs they choose to have in order to pay for it.” Ryan also recommended that in order to be prepared for the added costs of a sudden medical emergency, Americans should create a dedicated savings fund using the money from at least two of the mortgages on their homes.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to allay concerns over how the abrupt removal of Obamacare would impact millions covered by the legislation, House Republicans pledged Tuesday that they would not dismantle the healthcare law without first putting in place a detailed and comprehensive plan for disposing of patients’ disease-ridden corpses, sources confirmed. “We want the American people to know that we will not, under any circumstances, repeal the Affordable Care Act until we have a full, working Republican alternative for disposing of participants’ withered, virus-infested remains,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), adding that current enrollees can rest assured that the GOP is working tirelessly to draft provisions that will ensure every single Obamacare recipient can have their ashen and tumor-riddled carcass cremated, buried, or dissolved in a quick and efficient manner at minimal cost. “To those presently insured under the ACA, you can expect a smooth transition in the weeks ahead from your current coverage to our much cheaper, easier, and more convenient corpse-elimination plan. Your putrid lifeless body and the putrid lifeless bodies of your loved ones will be well taken care of—that’s our party’s guarantee to you.” McCarthy added that Americans will also be pleased to know that free-market competition will keep down the fees associated with the GOP’s plan, as all current Obamacare beneficiaries will soon have the option of having their moldering corpses disposed of across state lines.

Under our plan, you can still have lymphoma. You could even expand on that into other forms of cancer.

"ROCHESTER, NY—Honoring their performance and consistency in regularly appearing up and down the high-score screen for decades, the World Video Game Hall Of Fame formally inducted “ASS” into its hallowed collection in a gala ceremony Friday. “After years of being overlooked for outstanding contributions to gaming in every major arcade cabinet from   to  ,   to  , ASS is at long last getting the recognition they deserve,” said museum director Jon-Paul Dyson, pulling away a curtain to reveal the legendary moniker featured next to previous inductees “SEX,” “TIT,” and all-time champion “AAA.” “With this accolade, ASS joins the generations of superstars and influencers in this hallowed hall, taking their rightful place among arcade greats from XXX to FUK.” The occasion also marks the ninth year in a row that the honor has been denied to   legend “EJB,” who has admitted to using performance-enhancing codes.

"LEXINGTON, MA—Interrupting the two-time presidential candidate in the middle of her speech, a member of the Ruby Tuesday waitstaff reportedly warned Jill Stein Tuesday evening that her official Green Party response to President Trump’s congressional address was disturbing the restaurant’s other patrons. “Excuse me, ma’am, but if you wouldn’t mind lowering your voice a bit so other guests can enjoy their meals,” server Teresa Whitman politely asked Stein, who had spent the last several minutes railing against Trump’s plan to lower the corporate tax rate by 20 percent in front of a corner booth containing four other members of the Green Party. “We appreciate your dining with us this evening, but multiple tables have complained that your shouting about excessive military spending is upsetting their children. If you can’t speak at a reasonable volume, we’ll have no choice but to ask you to leave.” At press time, a defiant Stein was arguing that she had already purchased several rounds of Ruby Relaxer cocktails and was therefore entitled to denounce Trump’s proposal to cut $54 billion from non-defense-related federal programs as loudly as she wanted.

"WASHINGTON—As part of the standard contingency plan to ensure continuity of the American populace following a major catastrophe, sources confirmed that Jake Hyland of Kansas City, MO will serve as the nation’s designated survivor during President Donald Trump’s Tuesday evening address to Congress. “In the event that a terrorist attack or other disaster kills the other 324 million U.S. citizens tonight, Mr. Hyland would serve the vital role of assuming all the duties of the American people going forward,” said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, adding that the 43-year-old digital marketing manager has already been escorted to a secure, undisclosed location, where he will remain throughout Trump’s speech until authorities deem that the entire country’s population is no longer at risk of being collectively wiped out in a single cataclysmic event. “Mr. Hyland is currently being briefed on all necessary protocol and will be fully prepared to act as the sole remaining member of the country’s citizenry if necessary.” Clancy stressed, however, that order of succession would fall to higher-ranking Americans such as 57-year-old Jessica Perry of Fort Wayne, IN or 49-year-old Alexis Monroe of Harrisburg, PA if they were to also survive.

"TRENTON, NJ—Having arrived directly from the school gym where he played three-on-three basketball for 45 minutes, local 10th-grader Alex McKean reportedly spent the entirety of his math class Tuesday absolutely drenched in sweat. Early reports confirmed that the 15-year-old, who first entered the classroom with his sweat-stained T-shirt clinging to his body, immediately sprawled out on a chair in the back row, with beads of perspiration continuing to stream down his forehead, neck, and arms. Completely flushed in the face, the high schooler could also be heard panting heavily well into the first five minutes of the lesson as he tugged repeatedly at the front of his shirt in an effort to cool himself down. In addition to leaving all students in his vicinity visibly disgusted, McKean’s powerful body odor reportedly deterred his teacher from walking anywhere near his section of the classroom for the duration of the lecture. Following the bell, sources confirmed that McKean made a quick stop at a water fountain before showing up to his American history class with water still dripping from his mouth.

"PENNINGTON GAP, VA—Taking pains to ensure the returning citizens feel as normal as possible, government representatives confirmed Thursday that the Americans recently freed from North Korean prison will be put into U.S. detention camps to help ease the shock of their return to Western society. “In light of the months they spent in a brutal North Korean work camp, we thought it would make their transition home easier if they spent some time picking crops and paving roads as American prison labor,” said administration spokesperson Dara Zaleski, explaining that all three freed prisoners have been shipped to Lee Correctional Facility to alleviate the adjustment to American society by doing manual labor for 90 cents an hour. “After a 12-hour day of hard labor while being exposed to the elements and subjected to constant humiliation by prison guards, they’ll eat gruel barely fit for human consumption, spend some time in solitary confinement—anything to help them adapt to an American environment. Coming back to the U.S. can be a big culture shock, but fortunately, this country has no shortage of facilities that will make them feel like they never left North Korea.” Zaleski said that, assuming the prisoners maintained good behavior, they were expected to be paroled and returned to their families within the next five to seven years.

"NATICK, MA—Entirely unbeknownst to him, 45-year-old local resident Timothy Lang stood on the threshold of an exciting new phase in his life Monday as he typed the phrase “tender lump on neck” into Google’s search bar, sources reported. The simple act of entering the particular set of search terms into his internet browser and pressing the return key on his laptop is said to have suddenly opened a fresh new chapter in the man’s life, one that will soon introduce him to dozens of strangers and scores of novel, indelible experiences, while also fundamentally changing his relationships with friends and family, and leading him to make major alterations to his lifestyle. Further reports indicate that the split second between when he finished typing and the moment his search results appeared onscreen would be the last time Lang recognizes himself as the person he is now, as core aspects of the local bank manager’s very identity will, according to sources, begin to undergo immediate and significant transformations.

"With Aetna just the latest health insurance provider to opt out of covering Obamacare markets, many are wondering what changes can make the Affordable Care Act more appealing to customers and insurance companies. Here are some proposed improvements: Make system less reliant on corporations’ natural altruistic tendencies Lure more customers into the marketplace by offering coupon for one free pancreas Peanut allergy weirdos to pay an extra $90,000 in annual premiums Diversify member options by offering plans that cover varying levels of desire to live Adopt Scandinavian model of wellness by discouraging Americans from being lazy pieces of shit Maintain insurers’ ability to play God by allowing them to pull the plug on up to 1,500 members per year Maybe—and this is just a shot in the dark—rather than relying on private citizens’ employers to select individual insurance plans from third-party providers, the government could try taking a little bit out of everyone’s paychecks and then buy one great big insurance plan that covers everybody when they get sick?

"TOLEDO, OH—Displaying a level of strength and mobility that he will never again possess as he paced back and forth across his living room Tuesday, terminally ill man Thomas Halverson reportedly spent the last good day of his life on the phone with his insurance company. According to reports, the 56-year-old with Stage III liver cancer spent much of the morning and afternoon—a period in which he, for the last time ever, maintained a good appetite, a sufficiently functional immune system, and a reasonable level of energy—arguing a claim denial with nearly a dozen representatives across multiple departments, and on two separate occasions, starting his call over from the beginning after being suddenly disconnected. Sources confirmed that Halverson, who will in a matter of weeks be unable to get out of bed unassisted by nursing staff or carry on a conversation with his loved ones without them wondering whether it would be their last, could be seen during an hour-long wait on hold putting his phone on speaker mode while he, still able, stepped out onto his back deck momentarily to enjoy the fresh air. At press time, upon having his call transferred back to the very first representative he spoke with some five hours earlier, sources reported that Halverson could be overheard raising his voice and cursing loudly, the final time he’ll be able to do so without descending into a severely painful coughing fit.

"HARTFORD, CT—Saying the incident had forced them to completely rethink their past decisions about the man’s coverage and how they would approach his policy from here on out, Aetna executives reported Thursday that the recent heart attack of longtime plan member Michael Burns was a real wake-up call for the 163-year-old insurance company. “This came as a terrible shock, but to be honest, it was probably just what we needed to shake us out of our old habits and realize we have to make some big changes around here,” said CEO Mark Bertolini, adding that the health care provider had known for years that Burns’ monthly premium could be easily two or three times its current level, and that it was unfortunate that it had taken a major emergency and hospitalization for the company to finally do something about it. “You want to believe you can keep charging someone the same co-pays forever, but after this, we’re really going to have to keep a closer watch to make sure his yearly deductible keeps pace with his increased health risk—that’s just common sense. I honestly didn’t realize things had gotten this bad.” Bertolini added that he was just glad they had caught the problem while Burns still had plenty of profitably healthy years left.

By the time I visited the registry, someone had already gotten them the CT scan, but I picked out some blood tests, which is good because I know they’ll definitely need them. Plus, it’s nice to know they’ll be thinking of me when they use them.” When reached at press time, Chazen confirmed that no one had yet to touch the couple’s $2,120 annual deductible.

"DUANESBURG, NY—While attesting that the medication was safe and effective when taken as directed, the label for the antidepressant Lexapro specifically warned users that the pill should never be mixed with a long look in the mirror, sources confirmed Tuesday. “Do not consume alcohol or stare directly at yourself in the bathroom mirror while taking Lexapro, as serious complications could result,” read the label in part, before warning consumers that eyeing themselves up and down under the harsh light of a bathroom vanity or leaning in toward their reflection to closely examine their own face had been shown in clinical studies to cause adverse reactions and vastly decrease the drug’s efficacy. “Those who catch sight of themselves in the mirror should immediately discontinue eye contact with their reflection and avoid any impulses to take stock of their life. For best results, it is advised that users stay away from mirrors and other reflective surfaces entirely during the course of treatment.” The label went on to warn that the side effects of viewing oneself in the mirror while on Lexapro—which ranged from loss of appetite to suicidal thoughts—were likely to be significantly intensified should the user look at himself or herself unclothed.

"WASHINGTON—Causing dread and consternation among significant swaths of registered voters, a series of Reuters-Ipsos polls released Tuesday increased fears that the 2018 midterm elections will be won by a wave of politicians. “Right now, many Americans are worried that the 2018 elections could be an absolute landslide for politicians, and everything we’re seeing seems to suggest that this is a very real cause for concern,” said McGill University political analyst Tasha Martin, warning that every predictor released by major polling organizations pointed to a “near-tsunami” of midterm gains for politicians and political figures, groups notorious for being selfish, out of touch with the general public, and corruptly bending to outside interests. “In fact, most predictions offer a nearly 100 percent chance that politicians will win both the House and Senate in November. For most Americans, seeing politicians completely in control of Congress might be enough to cause them to lose all faith in democracy.” Martin added that preliminary polling also raised the frightening specter of a politician taking the White House in 2020.

Man, things haven’t changed a bit,” said a thrilled Bolton while making the rounds in the West Wing, adding how happy he was to see so many military conflicts he recognized from his time serving in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

"ROCHESTER, NY—During a meeting with new hires Wednesday to discuss employee benefits, Radian Analytics human resources manager Ellen Schultz is said to have strongly pushed the company’s infinite-deductible health care option. According to sources in attendance, Schultz described the low-premium, infinite-deductible plan as the simplest and most convenient choice available to employees, and said it works the same whether plan members need to visit their primary care physician, fill a prescription, or be admitted to a hospital, allowing them in each case to pay 100 percent of the incurred medical expenses. “With our Infinity Plan, you’ll see only a very small amount deducted from each paycheck, and then all you’ll have to do is pay as you go for whatever health care you may need,” said Schultz, adding that employees who select the package will never need to worry about obtaining preauthorization for any procedure and can simply pay a bill in full upon receiving it from their medical provider. “What’s more, it doesn’t matter if your doctor is in-network or out-of-network. The coverage is the same either way.” “It really couldn’t be any easier: Absolutely no services or medications are excluded from the plan, and there’s no annual cap on benefits,” she continued. “In other words, you can use the Infinity Plan for anything, and use it as much as you want—no ifs, ands, or buts.” Schultz went on to state that under most other health insurance plans, patients are responsible for co-pays in addition to their deductible, charges of $50, $100, or sometimes more that can add up quickly and unexpectedly. However, she said, there are no such co-pays under the Infinity Plan, so those who join it can rest assured that every cent they pay out of pocket will be applied directly to their infinite deductible. Company officials explained that the health care option had been set up to address complaints employees had with previous plans, which often came with confusing paperwork and long wait times for reimbursement, problems that have disappeared now that the limitless deductibles have eliminated any need to even bother filing a claim. “Best of all, the Infinity Plan lets you set up a health savings account, so you can pay the full list price of every single drug or medical procedure you need with pre-tax income and a convenient debit card,” said Schultz, noting that the policy also covers all dental work, elective cosmetic procedures, and specialist visits, with or without a referral. “We have year-round open enrollment for this option, so you can join anytime you like and even apply it retroactively back to your first day of employment.” “For those of you with dependents, I’d recommend the Infinity Plus Plan, which has a slightly higher premium but comes with one infinite deductible for your whole family,” Schultz added. At press time, Schultz was reportedly explaining to the new hires that all 401(k) contributions made by employees would be matched with a dollar-for-dollar withdrawal by the company.

"NEW YORK—Noting that the cost of the pharmaceutical drug places it out of reach for most of the U.S. populace, industry analysts confirmed Friday that the life-saving cancer medication Rizolafan remains far more accessible to a laboratory rat than to the vast majority of Americans. “While this drug has shown considerable efficacy in counteracting tumor growth, U.S. citizens who are currently suffering from advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer are far less likely to obtain a desperately needed dose than any number of albino rodents locked in cages in a biotech firm’s animal lab,” said Mount Sinai chief of medicine Dr. Martin Aberg, who stated that the average rat infected with the terminal illness could expect to receive as much of the medication as needed, while the thousands of people suffering from the same disease who live in the wealthiest country in the world likely would not. “Whereas most cancer-stricken Americans face insurmountable barriers to receiving this drug, ranging from insufficient insurance coverage to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs, and despite the fact that such a treatment could ease their suffering and significantly extend their lives, it is nevertheless consistently and freely available to hundreds of rats, which do not have to contend with any such obstacles.” Analysts also confirmed that the average rodent was provided with more personalized and attentive care than nearly 98 percent of patients in American hospitals.

"GALVESTON, TX—Amid a spate of public health warnings this week regarding the infectious disease’s devastating effects on fetal development, the Zika virus reportedly joined a lack of paid maternity leave and unaffordable child care as reasons why local woman Shannon Kemp is afraid of becoming pregnant. “I was going to hold off getting pregnant for a few years anyway out of fear that my company might let me go when they find out, but this whole Zika scare certainly doesn’t help things either,” said the 26-year-old, explaining that the threat of giving birth to a child with an underdeveloped brain was just one of a litany of reasons behind her dread of becoming pregnant, including the likelihood of being passed over for promotions, the lower salaries received by mothers, the rising cost of prenatal care, the rising cost of postnatal care, the increased difficulty in being hired should she want or need to switch jobs, and the social stigma associated with breastfeeding in public. “Honestly, this really isn’t even the thing that worries me most about getting pregnant. It’s definitely good to be aware of, but even if they find a cure for Zika tomorrow, it’s not like I can afford to get pregnant under my current insurance plan.” Kemp added that it’s a good thing she still has limited access to expensive contraception.

"WASHINGTON—Zigzagging through the State Dining Room in an effort to avoid bath time, a naked Eric Trump ran through his father’s first state dinner Tuesday pursued by a screaming au pair, White House guests have confirmed. The official ceremony to honor visiting French president Emmanuel Macron was reportedly interrupted midway through the main course when the commander in chief’s second-born son, who was entirely nude and covered in soap bubbles, burst through the double doors, immediately followed by a visibly flustered 17-year-old domestic servant who yelled at him to get back in the tub. Multiple eyewitnesses told reporters that when the young Trump crawled between the legs of Sen.

The childcare worker reportedly came close to catching Eric after he charged out from the other side of the table, shattering a piece of rare china and causing a butler to spill wine all over Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but the 34-year-old boy managed to escape and hide behind a Washington National Opera singer who was there to provide after-dinner entertainment.

Or, if you’re in a rush, just bleed directly into the PlasmaGo bin and we’ll sort it out later on our end. Whatever’s most convenient for you.” Should the new bins prove successful, McGovern said the organization would consider installing an additional slot for bone marrow.

"WASHINGTON—Muttering that he needed something more potent to get him flying again, Stephen Miller was desperately searching for his next fix Tuesday after the high of detained children began wearing off. “You get a taste for immigrant children suffering and then you’re always chasing the dragon—now I need at least half a dozen articles about kids being abused by their captors just to get to normal,” said the president’s senior advisor, absentmindedly scratching his arm and pacing back and forth as he sought out photos of crying Mexican mothers, lice-covered infants, or anything else that could provide him with a moment of much-needed release. “The hundreds of families still separated kept me going for a while there, and of course those reports of children being forever changed when they reconnected with their parents were some really good shit. But it’s just not enough anymore. I’m totally jonesing for something big, like an ICE detention center catching fire and burning everyone alive—something that can really get me off.” At press time, a blissed-out Miller had reportedly worked up a pretty good buzz looking at videos of tortured Libyan refugees who were barred from entering the United States under President Trump’s travel ban.  ",1,Stephen Miller Desperately Searching For Next Fix After High Of Detained Children Starts Wearing Off
"TACOMA, WA—Remarking upon the enormous caution she now takes before saying or doing anything in the presence of a loved one, local mother Sharon Powell, 64, told reporters Tuesday she knows any wrong move she makes could be interpreted by her family as a telltale sign of dementia. Powell claimed that even the simplest memory lapse, such as momentarily forgetting a distant relative’s name or losing track of what day of the week it is, might cause her children to worry that her mental state is in decline, setting into motion an irreversible series of events that would end with her moving into an assisted-care facility. “I have to be on top of my game every single day, because if I start slipping up, it’s only a matter of time before they put me in a home,” said Powell, who explained that she keeps her calendar by her side whenever she speaks on the phone with family members so she can recall without hesitation the date and time of any upcoming appointment, social event, or anniversary when it’s brought up. “I make sure I place my keys in the exact same spot 100 percent of the time. And I always speak at a steady, even pace—too fast and I might trip over a word, too slow and they might think I’m struggling to come up with the right words.” “Next week, I’m helping with my grandson Bradley’s ninth birthday, and I know that if I mess up one detail, if I get the wrong kind of frosting or forget the streamers, I’m as good as gone,” she added. The catalyst for Powell’s concerns was reportedly an incident last Christmas in which she mistook her son’s cell phone for her own, accidentally dialing a number from it. While chastising herself for the small oversight, she noticed her son whispering something to her youngest daughter in the hallway and immediately wondered if they were discussing whether her blunder was a symptom of Alzheimer’s. Ever since, Powell said, she has altered her behavior to avoid any situation that puts her at risk of appearing confused or forgetful, including cleaning up the slightest signs of clutter, carefully familiarizing herself with the settings on her newly purchased microwave, and double-checking to make sure she hasn’t left even one unpaid bill sitting on her kitchen counter. “I manage well enough during calls with the kids, but Thanksgiving’s coming up and I’m going to have to be on my toes for four straight days with everyone around,” said Powell, who confirmed that, out of increasing fear that the error would be “the one that does [her] in,” she would be setting multiple timers so she could be absolutely certain she does not burn the turkey. “If I so much as call my grandson by his father’s name in a moment of absentmindedness, there goes my independence. And if I don’t happen to hear everything that one of my kids says to me, there’s no way I’m asking them to repeat it—I’ll just be sticking to a general response of ‘That’s nice,’ making sure I maintain eye contact and deliver those words with confidence.” “Maybe I should leave some finished crossword puzzles lying around for people to find just in case,” she continued. Powell went on to state that she must be neatly dressed and perfectly groomed at all times, as any slight inattention to personal care could arouse suspicions of a deteriorating mind. She also noted that after rolling her ankle last week, she avoided contact with her family for several days, fearing they would take her accident as proof that a cognitive impairment was causing her to lose her sense of balance, and that she was in danger of taking a more serious fall at any moment. “I’ve stopped driving with my kids, because I know a single wrong turn might get them talking about whether it’s time to take my license away,” Powell said. “The last time I went shopping with my daughters, I missed the exit to the mall, and I swear I saw Rebecca raise an eyebrow and exchange glances with Allison. I must be on pretty thin ice already, and one more slip-up could get me carted off to assisted-living.” “Regardless, though, it’s good for me to keep up these habits,” she added. “That way, when I actually start losing my senses, I’ll already be really good at covering up for it.” ",1,Aging Mother Knows Any Wrong Move Could Be Taken For Telltale Sign Of Dementia
"WASHINGTON—Hastily scrawling with crayons and markers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were reportedly forging their father’s signature Wednesday on letters they had written excusing them from any further testifying as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into their family’s role in potential Russian election interference. “To ALL it may conzern, my two beutiful Sons are herebye Excused from anymore testifonials to mean mister Muler,” the two wrote on dozens of pieces of construction paper before Donald Jr. falsified his father’s signature, following a heated hour-long argument over who did a better imitation of the president’s handwriting. “My son’s Eric Jr and Dom haev a realy bad sick thing in their throats Forever now so they cant talk to mr. Muller ever again and he should leave Them alone okay?

"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging the widespread repercussions from the act of corporate censorship, first amendment experts warned Monday that Facebook’s decision to ban InfoWars could set a completely reasonable precedent for free speech. “If we allow giant media platforms to single out individual users for harassing the families of murdered kindergarteners, it could lead to a nightmare scenario of measured and well-thought-out public discourse,” said Georgetown law professor Charles F. Abernathy, cautioning that it was sometimes very easy for private organizations to draw a line between constitutionally protected free speech and the slanderous ravings of a bloated lunatic hawking snake oil supplements. “What we see here really could be the beginning of a slippery slope towards a horrific ordeal in which any citizen who violates hate speech policies or blatantly spreads lies that cause other individuals to receive death threats will immediately be discredited and, perhaps, even asked to host their demonstrably false content on a website that they actually own.” Abernathy added that sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube all need to learn that they are totally free to act within the law.

"LOS ANGELES—Expressing concern over the fallout from several controversial tweets praising the president, Kanye West’s publicist was reportedly worried Thursday that the rapper’s support of Donald Trump would damage his carefully crafted public image as a manic, self-absorbed lunatic. “Christ, we’ve worked so hard to maintain this image of Kanye as an incredibly vain, impulsive madman, and now he’s gone and ruined it all,” said stressed-out publicist Tracy Nguyen Romulus, explaining that she was in the middle of a massive damage control campaign to counter the effects that West’s statements had on fans who had always seen the hip-hop star as paranoid, egotistical, and delusional. “I’m concerned that when people think of Kanye now, they’ll associate him with these tweets, and not as being a batshit narcissist who will say absolutely anything for attention. Not to mention Kanye went and linked himself to our deeply unpopular president, destroying the illusion that he’s really just a deranged egomaniac absolutely obsessed with fame and power, and someone who already voiced support for Trump in the past. I don’t know what we’re going to do.” The publicist was also worried that a number of Kanye’s tweets about thought police and his inability to be managed would confuse and even alienate a public who knew the rapper to be straightforward, clear, and modest.

"SCOTTSDALE, AZ—Conceding that any actual committed relationship with the anthropomorphic rodent would likely entail the usual day-to-day spousal complications, bachelor Pete Brookeshire admitted Monday that, in reality, a marriage to Minnie Mouse wouldn’t be as perfect as he liked to imagine. “Yes, Minnie is my dream girl-mouse, but I’m aware that we’d almost certainly have our differences, even after we eventually tied the knot. For one thing, she’s always busy, which is great—I love how engaged she is with the world—but spending quality time with my partner is something I really value,” said Brookeshire, acknowledging that Minnie would probably carry some emotional baggage from her decades-long relationship with Mickey Mouse. “For years, I’ve put her on this pedestal, but what happens the first time I see her in sweatpants on the couch, not even wearing her iconic pink polka-dot bow? I’ve got to temper my expectations a bit, because I’m sure we’d squabble and bicker just like any other interspecies animated/non-animated couple.” At press time, a visibly crestfallen Brookeshire had “put the whole plan on hold” after realizing that Minnie Mouse would never even notice a schlub like him.

"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging that total war with a personality cult ruled by a nuclear-capable despot will be a harrowing commitment posing many unique challenges, newly appointed National Security Advisor John Bolton promised the American public Friday that the upcoming war with North Korea certainly won’t be a cakewalk like Iraq. “You have to admit, things in Iraq were pretty cut-and-dried—we went in there, we deposed the leader, we installed our own government, we never even had to think about the long-term consequences, and certainly no hordes of soldiers were forced to fight the tens of thousands of American teens we’re going to throw at them in great, meat-grinding, human-wave attacks like we’re about to see in North Korea,” said Bolton, who noted that as one of the architects of the “ultimately painless and remarkably successful” 2003 Iraq invasion, he knew what he was talking about when it came to planning a massive land campaign in Asia. “It’s a good thing we have regional, expendable allies, because after the first 90 minutes of this war, somewhere around 2 million South Koreans are going to be a thin layer of greasy soot in the stratosphere, if my plan goes correctly. Then we simply commit an entire generation of young Americans to dying in numbers so great that they will permanently change the geography of the Korean peninsula. As will North Korea’s nukes and our fission weapons, of course. Believe me, this war is going to be an absolute mess.” Bolton also warned that further delays in mobilizing for war with North Korea would inevitably push back the start of the U.S.’s upcoming war with Iran.

"AUSTIN, TX—Acknowledging that his recent removal from several major media platforms may be for the best, noted conspiracy theorist and InfoWars host Alex Jones returned to his humble roots Monday screaming conspiracy theories through a megaphone at people in the park. “Although having my show and podcasts taken down by elitist liberal tech companies like YouTube and Apple is part of the growing feminization of our country, it’s ultimately going to backfire on them, because now I’m free to get back to the thing that launched my career—screaming crucial information about chemtrails and the gay agenda into the faces of unsuspecting park visitors,” said Jones as he eagerly approached a group of jump-roping children to shriek at them about the rise of tuberculosis in Chobani yogurt. “Sure, getting to film my show in a nice big indoor studio is great, but I feel I’d lost some of the passion that comes from hollering at people up close while they try to enjoy a picnic or play a game of bocce ball. I used to wake up in the bushes almost every day, my piss-soaked pants bunched around my ankles, my mouth already shouting at passersby and trees about white genocide. I’ve long since paid my dues as a leading conservative pundit. But once my show took off, I couldn’t help but think that I’d lost a little of that human connection that only comes from seeing the flecks of your own spit on a stranger’s face as you tell them, your voice distorted from the amplification, about the false flag operations where crisis actors try to take away our guns. And there’s just no feeling quite like the rush of climbing to the top of the jungle gym, the sweet ache of your throat lining tearing as you scream at parents and kids about autistic Muppets, the heat of the sun-warmed playground equipment seeping into your flushed nude body.” At press time, Jones was being escorted from Austin’s Balcones Public Park by police officers after an unsuccessful attempt to sell his Child Ease supplements to a family celebrating their daughter’s birthday.

"NORILSK, RUSSIA—Following the president’s disclosure that the purpose of the controversial June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was in fact held to collect opposition research on Hillary Clinton, hundreds of Russian orphans were devastated Monday after realizing that Donald Trump Jr. did not in fact call Russian lobbyists to the headquarters of his father’s business in order to arrange their adoptions. “We truly believed the nice Americans were going to save us from this hopeless life of hardship and toil,” said Evgeny Mikhailov, age 9, tearfully unpacking a small suitcase in his boarding house room in a frigid industrial city at the northernmost edges of Siberia and comforting his six hungry, tired siblings as best he could while they sobbed themselves to sleep. “This was the glimmer of hope we needed after the tractor factory took our Mamka and Papenka, but we learn now that all is a sham. We thought the Americans really cared for us, but they were just trying to cover their deceitful tracks.” The more than 25,000 orphans betrayed by the scandal have gone on record to express their satisfaction at learning how President Putin was at least helping oppose the deceitful Trump by supporting American Democrats.

Furthermore, we cannot corroborate that a 2016 Russia Meeting stein handsomely emblazoned with the word ‘COLLUSION’ would make the perfect gift for birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations.” At press time, Trump denied that the low-low prices on the commemorative merchandise would be affected by recent tariffs on Chinese goods.

"WASHINGTON—In a stark reversal of past statements on the Trump Tower meeting, President Trump acknowledged Monday that he believed his eldest son would most likely be fine doing five to 10 years in a federal prison. “Despite reports that I’m concerned about my wonderful son being sent to jail, I actually think there wouldn’t be much harm at all if he was imprisoned for a decade or so,” said the president, directly contradicting previous reports that he had expressed worry to aides about his son facing legal repercussions for meeting with Russian agents by noting that Donald Jr. was a “resilient kid” who could easily weather a stint in a federal penitentiary until 2025. “Look, my son is young, he’s got a good head on his shoulders—I bet he’d do absolutely fantastic behind bars. Frankly, I’ve just got no problem with him getting locked up in a cell until he’s around 50. And, honestly, any news story telling you otherwise is a complete fabrication.” Trump also dismissed claims that he had any qualms about never seeing Jared Kushner again if his senior advisor were to receive a life sentence for treason.

"WASHINGTON—Citing leading economic indicators for its robust forecast of the nation’s fiscal climate, a new report released Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis found that the prevailing financial expansion will only continue and the economy will be invincible forever this time. “All available data tell us that the once-cyclical nature of the markets has stabilized, and the booming economic growth, low unemployment rates, and manageably slow rates of inflation that the country is currently enjoying are, in fact, unalterable and permanent,” said Herman Dale, lead author of the study, who noted that all marketplace uncertainty and instability are now behind us, as the current metastable economy will generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs and solid returns on all investments for the foreseeable future. “Americans can have complete confidence in obtaining mortgages, opening small businesses, and starting families, as this endless growth bubble is utterly unburstable. In fact, if everyone threw their money into stocks right now during our perpetual bull market, we’d all be millionaires in just a few short years.” At press time, Dale and his team retracted the report upon discovering a miscalculation and realizing the economy is actually on the brink of a devastating tailspin that will sink the entire country into a decades-long recession.

And if President Trump’s late fees and interest continue to accumulate, we’ll require additional collateral in the form of Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.” The collection agency also emphasized that if Trump did not completely satisfy his debts within the next 180 days, it was prepared to repossess the nation and have it sold off at auction.

"ANAHEIM, CA—With thousands of spectators visibly emotional after witnessing the heartwarming moment, fans at Monday night’s playoff game between the Anaheim Ducks and Chicago Blackhawks were reportedly treated to the rare sight of a pregnant Zamboni giving birth. “When the Zamboni started slowing down and shaking during the intermission, I initially thought something was wrong, but then I realized it was actually in labor,” said Anaheim fan Kyle Boneta, 32, adding that, after crowning for several minutes, the motor oil–covered newborn Zamboni then fell squeegee-first from its exhausted mother’s underside and onto the Ducks logo at center ice. “He eventually got up and tried to move around, but he was wobbling a lot because his wheels were so small. The whole thing was beautiful, especially seeing the little guy follow his mother around as they resurfaced the ice before the third period. It was really adorable.” Ducks officials told reporters the delivery was a far greater success than a similar event during the 2013 playoffs, when a Zamboni quickly devoured its offspring shortly after giving birth.

"MARRAKESH, MOROCCO—In a groundbreaking discovery that could shed light on the origins of the delightful species, anthropomorphologists from Cambridge University announced on Friday that they had unearthed the fossilized remains of the earliest known upright-walking banana. “It appears that bananas were already bipedal near the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch nearly 2 million years ago, an evolutionary development that not only allowed them to walk but also freed their arms to swing merrily as they whistled a tune,” said lead researcher Vanessa Johanson, adding that it was impossible to determine the gender of the specimen, however, as the long eyelashes and oversized hair bow that would indicate a female would almost certainly not be preserved after so many millennia. “Digital reconstruction techniques have led us to conclude that the bananas had large eyes, bushy eyebrows, and wide, toothy smiles that remained fixed in place throughout their lives. But, interestingly, they seemed unable to vocalize puns such as ‘I find you so a- -ing!’ which likely means the necessary structures in their mouths and throats developed at a later date.” Johanson went on to say that traces of sesame seeds found at the site suggest the bananas may have had contact with the talking hamburgers that had previously been discovered 30 miles away.

And I’ll probably arrive in the second or third period for those.

"NEW YORK—In the wake of NBA center Jason Collins and U.S. soccer midfielder Robbie Rogers coming out as homosexual, reports revealed Friday that the National Hockey League has in fact had hundreds of openly gay athletes throughout its history. Sources confirmed that gay players have actually been incredibly common in the NHL for decades, and the league is only now being credited with laying the groundwork for the growing acceptance of homosexuality in professional sports. “It’s obviously a watershed moment when a player from the NBA announces he’s gay, but most people forget about Montreal Canadiens winger Steve Shutt, who came out back in 1972,” said hockey historian Hank Crerand, noting that Shutt was the first of many gay NHL players to reveal their homosexuality. “Even though gay athletes still carry a stigma today, it’s nothing compared to the ’70s. The likes of Shutt and Gordie Howe faced not only vitriol and discrimination from fans and the media, but also their own teammates and coaches.” “The issue of gay athletes has now reached a major turning point, and it’s only a matter of time before someone in the NFL or MLB comes out,” Crerand continued. “But the idea that a player would not need to hide his sexual orientation from the public—and indeed be proud of it—was very much pioneered by the NHL.” Since its original inception in 1917 through to the “Original 6” era of the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s, the NHL has reportedly had a long history of gay players and was far ahead of its time in combating prejudice and intolerance toward homosexuality within locker rooms and stadiums. “Things really started to take a turn for the better when Mike Eruzione became the first openly gay captain of an Olympic hockey team to win a gold medal, leading the U.S. to victory over the Soviet Union during the famous 1980 ‘Miracle On Ice’ final,” explained Crerand. “I still remember everyone’s total shock during Eruzione’s emotional embrace with his boyfriend Ken [Morrow] on the ice after the game.” “That kiss really changed a lot of attitudes within the hockey community,” Crerand added. Bob Probert, who played 16 seasons for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, reportedly had a huge impact on the league as hockey’s “Homo Enforcer,” intimidating the competition and pummeling opponents with vicious punches. Crerand told reporters that Probert was the “most feared queer” in the NHL and transformed the perception that a homosexual hockey player couldn’t be a gay goon. Crerand stressed, however, that no athlete was more influential to the gay rights movement than Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as the greatest gay player in NHL history. “In arguably the most seminal press conference the sport has ever seen, Wayne Gretzky delivered his iconic ‘This Is Who I Am’ speech right after winning his first Stanley Cup with the Edmonton Oilers in 1984,” said Crerand, adding that within the following decade Mark Messier, Patrick Roy, and Claude Lemieux followed Gretzky’s lead. “Number 99 completely changed the landscape for gay athletes in the NHL, especially commercially, and no one had a greater impact on young gay hockey players around the world. And that is, of course, why the gay community nicknamed him ‘The Great One.’” Reports confirmed that Gretzky blazed the trail for current NHL stars Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin, Patrick Kane, Henrik Zetterberg, Evgeni Malkin, Jonathan Quick, Pavel Datsyuk, Ryan Suter, Paul Stastny, Martin St. Louis, Rick Nash, Ryan Miller, Patrik Elias, Stephen Gionta, Clarke MacArthur, Patrick Dwyer, Mike Rupp, Carey Price, Dustin Brown, Zbynek Michalek, Brad Richards, Derek Dorsett, Brian Boyle, David Krejci, Shea Weber, Derick Brassard, Sergei Gonchar, Braden Holtby, Brandon Dubinsky, Stephane Robidas, Colin Greening, James Reimer, Kevin Poulin, Brandon Prust, Travis Hamonic, Martin Brodeur, Joakim Andersson, Vincent Lecavalier, Josh Green, Daniel Alfredsson, Joe Thornton, Arron Asham, Alexander Steen, Michael Del Zotto, Patrice Bergeron, Matt Duchene, Teddy Purcell, Michael Ryder, Tomas Fleischmann, Lars Eller, Daniel Winnik, Jyri Niemi, Mikhail Grigorenko, Evander Kane, David Backes, Jiri Tlusty, Sam Gagner, David Desharnais, Cody Franson, Steve Ott, Dustin Byfuglien, Casey Cizikas, Daniel Sedin, Brian Campbell, Ilya Kovalchuk, Chris Neil, Patrick Sharp, Jaromir Jagr, Hal Gill, Mark Giordano, Marc-Andre Fleury, Ray Whitney, Mike Cammalleri, Lee Stempniak, James van Riemsdyk, Martin Hanzal, David Clarkson, Vinny Prospal, Taylor Hall, Ryan Getzlaf, Andrew Ladd, Alexander Semin, Max Pacioretty, Brenden Dillon, Jonathan Toews, Jordan Eberle, Marian Hossa, Frans Nielsen, Alex Galchenyuk, Bobby Ryan, Manny Malhotra, Mike Fisher, Bryan Little, Nail Yakupov, Patrick Marleau, Jonathan Huberdeau, Tyler Ennis, Craig Anderson, Saku Koivu, Shane Doan, Ryan White, Blake Wheeler, Evgeni Nabokov, Mark Fraser, Jeff Carter, Nicklas Backstrom, Michael Grabner, Brendan Gallagher, Tomas Plekanec, John Tavares, Taylor Pyatt, Alex Burrows, Rene Bourque, Jason Chimera, Joffrey Lupul, Corey Perry, Brad Stuart, Justin Williams, Matt Cullen, Marian Gaborik, Patrik Berglund, Brian Elliott, Josh Harding, Daniel Cleary, Roberto Luongo, Nazem Kadri, Zach Parise, Eric Staal, Jordan Staal, Marc Staal, Jared Staal, Steven Stamkos, and Ryan Kesler all coming out as gay in recent years. According to experts, the league’s progressive stance toward homosexuality also paved the way for the 2013 Philadelphia Flyers, the only professional sports roster in history to be comprised entirely of gay players. “It’s nice to see the rest of the sports world beginning to catch up to the NHL when it comes to gay tolerance,” said ESPN hockey analyst Barry Melrose, himself openly gay since the early 1990s. “A lot of credit also has to go to Gary Bettman, still the only openly homosexual commissioner of a North American sports league.” “But without a doubt, none of this would have been possible without the unbelievable altruism and open-mindedness of the NHL fan base,” added Melrose, “It’s far easier for players to be truly comfortable in their own skin knowing so many fans are gay too.” ",1,Report: NHL Actually Has Had Hundreds Of Openly Gay Players For Years

"PALO ALTO, CA—Shedding light on how hockey players convey information without an advanced verbal language, a study published this week by Stanford biologists has found that players may communicate by banging their sticks against wooden boards surrounding the rink. “We found that hockey players can use stick-banging to indicate anything from disagreement with a referee to encouragement of their teammates,” said lead researcher Dr. Margaret Cundiff, who explained that players typically strike the boards a single time with force when they want to display anger, or use multiple softer taps in order to display approval. “Sometimes, an entire bench full of players will begin banging the boards in unison—either signaling that a goal has occurred, or that the players want a goal to occur. This actually lets hockey players ‘speak’ to each other, if you will, in surprisingly complex ways far beyond what was previously anticipated. They are truly magnificent creatures.” The study also concluded that hockey fans’ common behavior of pounding their hands against the glass while emitting a series of guttural grunts serves no discernible purpose.

"WINDEN FALLS, WA—Just days after a fatal accident claimed the life of high school sophomore Brian Tillerman, members of the 16-year-old’s loose-knit hometown of Winden Falls, WA told reporters Thursday they were not all that devastated by the news of his death. Saying that the tragedy certainly hadn’t touched each of them personally, the 9,300 barely connected Winden Falls residents explained that they did not struggle to absorb the news of Tillerman’s sudden passing and don’t really feel as if a hole has been left in their community. “I didn’t really know Brian or his family very well, so none of this hits home for me,” said local mother Jessica Winger, who noted that her children didn’t grow up with Tillerman, didn’t play Little League with him, and didn’t see him every day in school, and admitted that, even if they had, she probably wouldn’t remember him. “I can’t say life in Winden Falls has changed in any noticeable way since Brian’s death. And to be honest, it never really crossed my mind to keep him in my thoughts and prayers.” “I’d say that everyone in town pretty much knows how we’re going to get through the days ahead,” Winger continued. “Frankly, it’ll probably be pretty easy to move on from this.” Tillerman, who was killed Sunday morning when he lost control of his car on a wet road and skidded into a tree, was described by community members as a student at one of Winden Falls’ two high schools who probably had a group of friends, could have possibly attended church regularly with his parents, and may or may not have had a bright future ahead of him. Describing their small, quiet village as “cold” and “unwelcoming,” the vast majority of town residents said they would not attend a memorial for Tillerman over the weekend, admitting that coming together in solidarity with their fellow residents actually sounded uncomfortable and seemed like a pretty big hassle. “This really hasn’t been too hard on all of us,” said Donald Parker, a local general store owner who claimed he doesn’t know or converse with his customers and had no idea whether or not Tillerman came into his shop regularly. “You see, most of the people in Winden Falls haven’t lived in town for too long, and we’re by no means a part of each other’s daily lives, so rallying behind Brian’s family and offering our support didn’t feel at all like the natural thing to do.” “The thing is, when something like this happens to someone in our community, it pretty much only impacts that one person,” Parker continued. “That’s just how it is in Winden Falls.” Gloria Murphy, a 66-year-old retiree who has lived for many years on the same street as the Tillermans, confirmed to reporters that she spoke only a few quick words in passing to Brian’s parents and siblings over the past decade. Like most town residents, Murphy said she never invited her fellow townsfolk into her home and pretty much sought to minimize all interactions with those living near her. “In this town, neighbors definitely don’t count on one another or look after each other—we pretty much just keep to ourselves,” said Murphy, who noted that she hadn’t observed anything close to a community-wide outpouring of sympathy following the accident. “I don’t think anyone around here has ever felt as if their neighbors were like members of their own family, and this accident certainly hasn’t changed that view.” “People from Winden Falls are definitely not the people you want around you in a time like this,” Murphy added. Community leaders have reportedly neither reached out to Tillerman’s family nor sought to publicly comfort and reassure residents in the wake of the tragedy, with Winden Falls mayor Toby Leekham noting that he has felt personally unmoved by the teen’s death. “Townspeople haven’t really mentioned anything about preserving Brian’s memory, so that’s something we probably won’t do,” Mayor Leekham said. “More than anything, I think this tragic accident has demonstrated to everyone just how distant and uncaring the Winden Falls community truly is.” Added Leekham, “Honestly, most of us have already forgotten all about Brian.” ",1,Loose-Knit Community Not Particularly Shattered By Teen’s Death
"NEW YORK—Following the quick identification and arrest of a suspect in this weekend’s series of bombings in New York and New Jersey that injured 29 people, the American public sought to make it clear Monday that their rational, measured response to this act of terrorism did not preclude them from having a panicked overreaction to any future threat. “Sure, we did a pretty good job of staying calm this time around, but that doesn’t mean we won’t fly completely off the handle and descend into a destructive paranoia with the next one,” said Philadelphia resident Derek Kelly, echoing the sentiments of tens of millions of other Americans who stated that they had not ruled out following their levelheaded response to this weekend’s events by blowing the next report of an explosion way out of proportion and letting it affect every aspect of their daily lives. “Just because we didn’t spend the past two days regarding everyone around us with unfounded suspicion, obsessively watching hour after hour of cable news coverage for the latest updates, and fretting on social media about how it’s not safe to live in America anymore, that’s no guarantee the next attack—or even just the possibility of an attack—won’t have us freaking the fuck out and calling for radical changes to our laws. And if the next incident isn’t resolved as rapidly or if it targets some iconic American monument, keep in mind that we’ve got carte blanche to go completely off the deep end.” Kelly added that neither he nor any of the nation’s other 320 million citizens had ruled out retroactively losing their mind over this attack once the alleged bomber’s motivations were made clear.

"LOS ANGELES—Unleashing a brutal wave of violence and destruction that has upended the entire power structure of the entertainment industry overnight, the nation’s C-list celebrities have carried out a bloody coup to overthrow the hottest stars in Hollywood, sources reported Tuesday. Armed hordes of lesser-known actors—who rampaged from studio to studio, setting fire to everything in their path and leaving the dismembered bodies of their A-list counterparts scattered across Los Angeles County—reportedly rose up and revolted after years of being passed over for leading roles, denied awards, and generally ignored by the media in favor of those with greater name recognition. “We’ve tried to contain the damage, but much of the city is in flames, and a marauding faction, which appears to be led by actor Taye Diggs, is now in complete control of the area from Sunset Boulevard all the way down to Pico,” said L.A. police chief Charlie Beck, adding that the carnage began Monday when a contingent of actors from the TNT show   stormed the Ivy Restaurant in West Hollywood and began slitting the throats of top-tier celebrities. “We have at least 57 confirmed casualties, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, and Sandra Bullock.” “Unfortunately, heavy violence and bloodshed continue throughout much of the area,” added Beck, the sound of sirens and intermittent explosions audible behind him. “I can confirm that the entire neighborhood of Brentwood has been lost.” Following decades of strained relations, tensions between actors of limited fame and the Hollywood elite are believed to have reached a boiling point yesterday when former child star Frankie Muniz was bumped from his slot on  after an interview with Channing Tatum ran longer than expected. Sources said word of the slight spread quickly, fomenting unrest and prompting calls for vengeance among the mildly famous. According to a shaken casting director who barely escaped the grisly scene, a group of actors auditioning for a small guest role on   turned on the show’s producers Monday afternoon and began systematically stringing up cast and crew members from a stoplight at a nearby intersection. By evening, minor celebrities, including John Larroquette and Raven-Symoné, were seen crashing a star-studded screening of   at the El Capitan Theatre, where they allegedly stormed the red carpet with machetes and massacred each of the movie’s leads in front of the paparazzi. The rebellion’s spokesman, former   cast member Brent Spiner, appeared in a video alongside  ’s Dylan Baker and Ashley Tisdale of the   franchise to detail the group’s demands. “It is we, the overlooked and the underpublicized, who today have made these streets run red with the blood of studio heads and beloved superstars,” Spiner said into the camera, standing near a shackled and gagged George Clooney. “Henceforth, members of our ranks will be featured on magazine covers and given starring roles, and we will never again be made to perform in reality-show talent competitions. For every hour that our demands are not met, another top star dies.” “Goodbye, Mr. Clooney,” Spiner added before unloading a single round from his silenced pistol into the   star’s face. According to witnesses, dozens of angry actors marched off the CW lot in Burbank yesterday and pillaged through the streets carrying the head of TV executive Les Moonves. Bands of the irate C-listers are said to have poured down from the Hollywood Hills at nightfall, reportedly smashing the limousines and luxury vehicles they encountered on Melrose Avenue and Rodeo Drive before laying siege to the Los Feliz compound of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. A visibly stunned and blood-spattered maid working at the Pitt-Jolie residence told reporters she saw former   actress Della Reese and an   finalist bludgeon the star couple to death with their own Academy Award and Golden Globe statuettes. Others who managed to escape the violence shared similar stories of the wanton killing carried out by the crazed lower-tier television and film actors. “Bodies were piling up all around me, and I just got under my desk and prayed,” said Weinstein Company executive assistant Marley LaFond, who described a number of cast members from   and  , whom she recognized but was unable to name, storming her Beverly Hills office, massacring employees, and forcing Harvey Weinstein to sign a contract with his own blood that guaranteed his attackers prominent film roles for the next decade. “They tied me up and forced me to watch as they threw Mr. Weinstein out a window.” “Then they put a gun up to my head and told me to tell the world what happened in there,” a trembling LaFond continued. In a disturbing display of the scope and gruesomeness of the uprising, a video was leaked online of Alicia Silverstone and Lance Bass commandeering a TMZ Celebrity Tour bus and crashing it through a fundraising gala at Leonardo DiCaprio’s mansion. In the video, the pair are seen detonating explosives strapped to their chests, killing an unknown number of household names along with themselves. With such violence continuing unabated, many with connections to the C-list rioters have begun speaking out in hopes of bringing about an end to the celebrity mass murder. “Please! I beg of you, stop this madness,” WME talent agent Ari Emanuel said in a public address this morning directed at the rebel group. “We care about all our talent equally. Think about what you’re doing to the American people when you spill the blood of their most-loved celebrities. You’re not just harming the big-name movie stars; you’re harming the audience. It’s time for the slaughter to end.” “You have our attention now,” Emanuel added. ",1,Hollywood Stars Overthrown In Bloody C-List Uprising
"CHICAGO— Speaking with members of his staff in private Monday after receiving the most recent municipal crime statistics, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel is said to have expressed his concern that the metropolitan area’s gun violence problem might soon spread to the parts of the city he actually gives a shit about, sources reported. “Listen, we’re at 3,000 shootings this year and counting—it’s only a matter of time before this violence migrates from the areas of the city I don’t give a fuck about into the areas that actually matter in my eyes,” the second-term mayor reportedly said, adding that it would be devastating to see such senseless shootings affect residents outside of the large swaths of Chicago he has written off entirely. “If we don’t do something soon to keep guns off the streets of those particular neighborhoods that I consider worthwhile, things could really spiral out of control. Enough is enough when it comes to the parts of this city that I choose to serve.” At press time, Emanuel was breathing a sigh of relief after learning that six Chicagoans killed overnight were shot dead in neighborhoods he couldn’t care less about.

"TREVIGLIO, ITALY—High-end bicycle manufacturer Bianchi unveiled its new ultrawide “Disagio” model on Friday, a touring bike specially designed to block, box in, and jostle subway commuters at the height of rush hour. “At 7 feet long with a 52-inch handlebar span, the Disagio makes it easy to obstruct doors and snag people’s coats and bags as they awkwardly contort themselves around its massive frame,” said product manager Pietro Galloni, highlighting the bike’s slip-prone kickstand and sharpened titanium pedals that jut into the aisles an extra 4 inches on each side. “Plus, we’ve stiffened the bike’s front fork to extend its turning radius, so anytime commuters are pushing to get in or out of a jam-packed subway car, it’s nearly impossible to move out of the way. We’re proud to say that the Disagio is the only bicycle that offers Bianchi craftsmanship in tandem with the ability to effectively imprison dozens of passengers.” Galloni added that the Disagio comes standard with misaligned tires that make it take twice as long to mount to the front of a bus.

"TAL AFAR, IRAQ—Admitting it had stopped counting after the first dozen or so occasions upon which it passed from one fighting force to another, an American-made M4 carbine assault rifle confirmed Wednesday it was losing track of how many times it had switched sides during the ongoing war in Iraq. According to the standard-issue automatic weapon, which was transported to Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army in 2003, it has changed hands so often since arriving in the country that it can no longer remember all the insurgent factions, terrorist organizations, and military groups it belonged to before ISIS took possession of it last month. “I definitely started out with the Americans—I know that—and then I was with the new Iraqi Army for a while, but after that it’s all kind of a blur,” the rifle said of its 13 years of near-continuous use in various military operations, uprisings, and sectarian battles. “At one time or another, I’ve been with al-Qaeda in Iraq, the Promised Day Brigade, some Salafi Islamists, a British commando unit, the Badr Organization, and God knows who else. And if I had to guess, I think I’ve been back with the U.S. Army three times. Maybe four.” “And I know I was in Syria a couple times, but I honestly couldn’t tell you which side I was on,” the 5.56-millimeter firearm added. The gun was able to confirm that, when the U.S. military was training a new Iraqi special forces unit in 2004, it fell into the possession of a defector who fled with it to Baghdad’s Sadr City district and joined the Mahdi Army. The rifle indicated that “things get kind of fuzzy” at that point, stating that it was pretty sure it was then seized by Blackwater agents during a CIA-ordered raid of insurgents and subsequently sold to a local weapons dealer. It quickly added, however, that it wasn’t 100 percent positive it was remembering the sequence in the correct order. After that, the M4 was reportedly headed out of the country as part of an illicit arms shipment, but Kurdish Peshmerga forces intercepted it just short of the Turkish border, though the gun acknowledged that it might be confusing that instance with the time it was seized by the Peshmerga in a raid on a terrorist safe house in Mosul. The rifle was unable to confirm its whereabouts at any particular point in the hazy decade that followed, suggesting only that it traversed much of Iraq and the surrounding region as it was repeatedly sold, stolen, seized from weapons caches, or pulled from the hands of dead fighters on active battlefields. “I remember shooting at Sunni militants from a car at one point probably around 2007, but then I also have this vague memory of being used to retaliate against their Shia rivals a week or two later—not sure how all that happened,” the rifle said. “After a while, it’s pointless to try to sort it out. Was I with the Marines in Anbar province during the surge, or just lying around in an arms depot somewhere in Baghdad? Hell if I know.” Sources were able to determine the gun had been in Ramadi at various times since the outset of the Iraq War, but noted that the city was successively under the control of the U.S.–led multinational coalition, a series of Sunni insurgents, the Iraqi government, the Islamic State, and then, in late 2015, U.S.–backed Iraqi forces, leaving them no closer to determining which side the rifle had served on. “I’ve gotten pretty used to moving around constantly, and these days, I don’t even really pay attention to the loyalties of whoever’s carrying me,” the M4 said. “I’ve always wondered if I might make it back to America someday, even though it doesn’t seem very likely anymore.” “But hey, who knows,” the rifle continued. “I’ve heard I might be going to Europe soon.” ",1,Assault Rifle In Iraq Losing Track Of How Many Times It’s Switched Sides During War

After all, the international community fully recognizes that anything less than decisive action would be completely immoral and unconscionable.” The collapsing man then reportedly took solace as he witnessed an entire brigade of armed UN peacekeepers flood into his city with vital relief supplies in a hallucination caused by the systematic shutdown of his brain functions.

"CAMBRIDGE, MA—According to a groundbreaking new scientific study released Tuesday by Harvard University, the U.S. population could very well have discovered a new and unprecedented level of not caring about Syria. ""Our research indicates that Americans may have stumbled upon an extreme degree of ignorance and disregard for the plight of dying Syrians that we never before thought humanly possible,"" said lead researcher Dr. Henry Mason, noting that recent images of the Syrian government openly killing citizens in the nation's streets appeared to have no measurable effect on American psyches. ""At some point—possibly after the mass murder of more than 100 men, women, and children in Houla, or when photos of mass graves began appearing across the Internet—the U.S. citizenry must have found previously untapped reserves of callousness, indifference, and self-absorption that were simply beyond the capacity of our research tools to quantify."" Mason confirmed that scientists expect apathy levels to rise sharply in further trial studies, primarily because 95 percent of Americans still don't know the president of Syria's name.

"WASHINGTON—Citing a sharp increase in casualties among combat troops in Syria, top military officers Wednesday called for the distribution of improved body armor to all soldiers in the region while also expressing regret for informing the nation of the ongoing Syrian War in this admittedly awkward way. With 2010 already the deadliest year yet in the five-year conflict that officials reiterated could have been revealed to the American people much more gracefully, the U.S. Army's highest-ranking officer told reporters that the government should not hesitate to protect service members from enemy attacks that grow more sophisticated and lethal every day. ""If we can't keep our soldiers from harm we cannot effectively wage this war, which, it should be noted, we're truly sorry for not bringing up earlier,"" said Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey, adding that there was now a page on the military's website where Americans could catch up on all the developments in Operation Righteous Sword since 2005. ""Unfortunately, the enemy has made significant improvements in its battlefield tactics. By the way, 'the enemy' refers to regional Syrian militias, Hezbollah paramilitary groups, and multinational fighters from al-Qaeda."" ""We've already lost almost 4,000 brave men and women,"" Casey added. ""Which actually does sound like a lot now that I'm saying it out loud to the whole nation for the first time."" Casey said that American soldiers—who the general sheepishly explained are now engaged in urban warfare with guerillas after defeating the Syrian national army and conquering the capital of Damascus in 2008—were driving vehicles that were particularly vulnerable to the powerful improvised explosive devices used by followers of the radical Syrian warrior-cleric Abd al-Rahman Kuki. While insisting that losses of life on the scale of last June's As-Suwayda Offensive were an anomaly, Casey acknowledged that the military had been slow to adapt to the flood of al-Qaeda militants into the region over the past three years and that Americans everywhere, had they known about any of this, would have been rightly concerned about the security risks to their men and women in uniform. Casey also said that the public, once it had fully grasped that the United States was embroiled in a third major war, would not tolerate anything less than total victory. ""The American people will always support the troops no matter where they end up standing on this war—and, again, we can't say enough how embarrassed we are to have dropped it on them like this,"" said Casey, who also wished to apologize to Muslim-Americans for not informing them of last December's botched midnight bombing raids on a number of mosques in Aleppo. ""We'd honestly wanted everyone to hear it from the president first. It just didn't work out that way."" When pressed by reporters to explain why the military had failed to disclose the existence of the Syrian War, one senior official said that after the resounding success of the battle of Deir ez-Zor in the closing months of 2005, everyone expected a swift victory to follow, with Americans too caught up in the celebration to be upset. Casey also claimed that with all that's been going on politically and economically over the past five years, the time to tell Americans about the deadly, escalating conflict currently engaging one third of the nation's standing army ""just never seemed quite right."" Despite the call for more body armor, officials sought to reassure the public that the Syrian War was being conducted with the benefit of lessons learned from previous conflicts. ""I want to say loud and clear that this war is being fought the right way for the right reasons,"" said outgoing defense secretary Robert Gates, conceding that it still would have been nice if even one person involved in national security had mentioned it. ""This is not another Iraq. This is not another Afghanistan, and it is certainly not another Yemen."" ""Whoops,"" Gates added. ",1,Army Calls For Increased Body Armor For Troops In Syria

"DALLAS—After taking an “eye-opening” tour of the newly dedicated George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas Thursday, President Barack Obama reportedly ordered the United States military to reinvade Iraq. The president told reporters that the museum’s numerous displays provided illuminating information concerning the ongoing threat posed by Iraq and the necessity of re-deploying combat troops in order to bring stability and lasting democracy to the troubled country. “I have no doubt in my mind, after spending some time in Mr. Bush’s library and museum, that the United States simply must intervene in Iraq in order to temper volatility in the Middle Eastern region as a whole,” Obama said, noting that bombers and approximately 250,000 ground troops were currently en route to the Middle Eastern nation. “The way I now see it, we have a responsibility as Americans to create that kind of change and to lead the world by example.” “Though it will not be easy, our work in Iraq will ensure a better life for the Iraqis,” Obama continued. “And they will, I am confident, greet us as liberators.” Pointing to the array of informational displays and exhibits housed in the former president’s 226,000-square-foot educational facility, Obama said he was “absolutely convinced” that al-Qaeda has established a major foothold in Iraq and that the people of Iraq deserved to live in a society that is “free of fear and free of want.” “Let me go a step further and say that if we do not act now to enact a regime change in Iraq, the consequences will be dire,” Obama said, adding that, as evidenced by documents he read in the Bush museum, Iraq was likely the axis upon which the entire Middle Eastern region turns. “It is a hotbed for terrorism, and, as demonstrated by the Bush archives, invading Iraq will allow us to put a stop to those religious extremists who actively seek to harm the U.S. and hold America hostage.” “They hate our freedoms,” Obama continued. Obama added that though engaging Iraq might result in a protracted conflict, he was confident upon further researching the library’s materials that the United Nations and the international community would come together to support such a necessary, morally justifiable endeavor. “Working together with our numerous allies, we can and will be an agent of change,” the president said, thanking his predecessor for making a “truly convincing case” for military intervention in Iraq. “Through our noble efforts, we will transform Iraq into a bastion of democracy and cause peace to spread throughout the region, ensuring stability and prosperity in the Middle East for generations to come.” “I stand by this decision because I know it is the right thing to do,” Obama added before leaving the museum. “And I think history will judge me accordingly.” ",1,Obama Orders Reinvasion Of Iraq After Illuminating Trip Through Bush Presidential Library

"WASHINGTON—Following two Supreme Court rulings today that allowed homosexuals in California to wed, extended federal benefits to same-sex married couples, but stopped short of calling gay marriage constitutional, the nation celebrated what is, technically speaking, progress, sources confirmed. “Today this country took, well, you know, certainly not a bold step forward, or anything even close to a leap, but, if we’re really looking at particulars, a step nonetheless,” said Virginia resident Aaron Yelenick, who celebrated the nation’s admittedly somewhat underwhelming but inarguably forward-facing move outside the Supreme Court Building. “You certainly couldn’t call this a step backward. So, there you go. That’s something.” “Anyway,” he added, “hooray.” With shouts of  “Land of the free, certainly more so than it was yesterday, at least!” and “We did it—if you look at the details here and ignore that it’s still disappointing that a high number of gay men and women still don’t have the same rights as straight citizens!” millions of Americans took to the streets to celebrate what is, in the end, a victory. According to jubilant citizens across the country, no one can argue that the Supreme Court’s decision doesn’t fit into the very strict, dictionary definition of the word “progress,” insomuch as homosexuals were previously treated unfairly and, if one looks at it purely from an objective standpoint, will now be treated slightly less unfairly. The U.S. populace went on to confirm that the country is, technically speaking, making advances in gay rights. “Today, we as a nation got closer to something, so that is, by reasonable deduction, progress,” California resident and homosexual Lisa Gerard said. “I can now marry my girlfriend Erica, and Erica will be seen as my legal spouse under federal law. That improves my life greatly, so that totally counts as progress. Now, can my friend Peter who lives in Mississippi marry his longtime partner, David? No. Does the federal government recognize their union? No. Did nine people who are essentially supposed to be the most educated people in the United States basically say Peter and David are unequal to Erica and myself? They did.” “Anyway,” she added, “let’s party!” According to a CBS News/  poll taken after the Supreme Court ruling, 34 percent of respondents said that increased rights for gay Americans couldn’t be called a non-victory; 42 percent noted that America is now a beacon of human rights, but not an extremely bright beacon, per se; and 10 percent said the ruling is a “very big deal,” if one is willing to scale back their idealism and expectations fivefold. Nearly 95 percent of respondents said that, after looking at all the specifics, reading the judges’ majority opinions, thinking 10 to 15 years down the line, taking into consideration the overall trajectory of the country, understanding that everything takes time, and remembering that it is politically opportunistic for a majority of Congressmen to at least be seen as fair, what happened today moved the country forward. “It certainly would have been great today to have found out that I now live in a country that isn’t so goddamn hypocritical and ass-fucking-backward when it comes to equality,” said homosexual Evan Benzio, causing those celebrating around him to momentarily stop cheering. “But whatever. Fuck it. I’ll take it.” ",1,"Nation Celebrates What Is, Technically Speaking, Progress"

James David Thurman admitted Friday that he felt extremely jealous of the Syrian military’s ability to relentlessly attack its own citizens. “When I saw footage of Syrian forces at a protest gunning down their fellow countrymen with total impunity, I thought, man, what I wouldn’t give to roll into Dayton, OH with 10,000 troops and take a few hundred people out,” said Thurman, who later called Syrian Gen. Abdul Fatah Qudsiya “the luckiest guy in the world.” “You don’t know how many times I’ve thought about driving a tank up to a packed movie theater and firing indiscriminately at American men, women, and children without any repercussions. But I can’t do that because we have all these stupid rules.” As of press time, Thurman had formally requested permission for “one little air strike” on Houston.

"WASHINGTON—A report released Monday by the Pew Research Center revealed that a growing number of American fifth-graders are opting to take a gap year to unwind from the stresses of elementary education and recharge themselves before taking on the rigors of middle school. “We found that it’s increasingly common for kids to put off enrolling in the sixth grade for a year and instead give themselves the freedom to focus all their energy on relaxation and personal growth,” the report read in part, adding that many 11-to-12-year-olds see the break as a time to step back and reflect on what they’ve learned about topics such as the California Gold Rush, decimal place values, and earthquakes, as well as to ponder what they want to get out of their middle school years. “While some fifth-graders still take the classic approach of traveling in the hopes of finding themselves, a significant number prefer to just play out in the yard or visit the zoo a lot. And if the trend continues, it may soon be the norm for kids to spend a year learning a specialized skill, such as getting really good at riding their bike with no hands or seeing how many Twizzlers they can fit in their mouth, rather than reflexively moving up to the next grade.” The report also noted that for many students, the decision was primarily driven by money, as 12 extra months of allowance would provide financial breathing room once they started junior high.

"NEW YORK—An absolutely terrible manuscript written by local aspiring novelist Brandon Heath reported today that “Chapter 1: Clark.” “It was late autumn, the leaves on the trees were a brilliant, blazing red, and Clark Thurman was gazing at the passerby just outside his apartment window,” continued the just awful first draft of Heath’s 80,000-word book,  , which according to its author details the interlocking fortunes of three strangers living in 1950s Manhattan and which sources confirmed is very bad. “For a moment, Clark thought he heard Mary call his name from the kitchen, but then he remembered school was back in session and the woman he loved had returned to her studies at Swarthmore, leaving him here, alone.

"WASHINGTON—Currency-themed website KurrencyKook.com weighed in on the Department of the Treasury’s soon-to-be-released 2013 line of $100 bills with a decidedly mixed review Thursday. “Overall, the bill is crisp and the inking is neatly done, and yet I can’t help but see this entire redesign as a bit of a missed opportunity,” said veteran currency reviewer John “The Buck” Mullen, who gave the banknote “62 cents out of 100” in his 1,100-word write-up. “The fine-line printing on the Benjamin Franklin portrait on its obverse is excellent, without a doubt, but ultimately, this only mildly pleasing bill is far from the Treasury’s best effort. It leaves one wondering, the farther away we get from the stunning 1996 redesign, if the Treasury will ever again match those lofty heights.” KurrencyKook’s review contrasted sharply with that of rival site MoneyManDan.com, which claimed the new bill was “the kind of legal tender design you dream about: elegant, forward-thinking—and, if I may, this baby looks like a million bucks.” ",1,KurrencyKook.com Gives New $100 Bill Mixed Review
"BOSTON—After Monday’s horrific terror attack at the Boston Marathon that killed three and left hundreds injured, officials confirmed Tuesday that the bombings and senseless violence that followed occurred primarily because this is the kind of world we live in now. According to reports, this is an age when, in an instant, two explosions can go off in rapid succession in a major urban center, disrupt the lives of thousands, and terrify hundreds of millions. In addition, those familiar with the situation went on to note that going through one’s day-to-day life with the uneasy feeling that a devastating act of violence could happen with little rhyme or reason is “just how it is now.” Sources later confirmed that people crying, blood-spattered roads, and complete and total chaos are how the current world works and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. “My fellow Americans, the events that happened yesterday in Boston are entirely consistent with the current state of humankind,” President Barack Obama said during a briefing in the White House East Room. “The days when we could walk outside and feel completely safe and secure are over. People die going to school now. They die going to the movies. And they die because, in this world, it’s more likely than not that some madman out there is hell-bent on instilling fear in others and destroying the lives of innocent people.” “That’s the world in a nutshell, basically,” Obama continued. “It’s heartbreaking and frustrating and the powerless feeling it leaves me with fills me with pure, unadulterated rage. Thank you, and God bless America.” Saying that being completely shocked by an urban bombing is now a thing of the past, officials confirmed that it’s no longer outside the realm of possibility for a mother, son, daughter, or husband to leave home in the morning and not return at night. Moreover, we now reportedly live in a time and place where expecting the worst and feeling slightly afraid of what awful thing will happen next is the default state of being. Sources added that it is a horrifying, volatile world where phrases such as “our thoughts and prayers go out to,” “responders are currently sorting through the carnage,” and “a child is among the victims” are lines that everyone is now, sadly, quite familiar with. Devices going off in trash cans, a citywide search for other deadly explosives, misinformation at the time of the attack, calling friends and making sure they are still alive, cell phone service being knocked out, images of someone in shock because they’ve just lost their limbs, and being overtaken by an overwhelming feeling of helplessness are all reportedly just part of how the world is now. “If you are not hyper-vigilant and in some way fearful for your very life then, I’m sorry, you’re living on a completely different planet,” National Security Advisor Tom Donilon told reporters. “Now, if you feel like you live in an unpredictable place where somebody hates you for no reason whatsoever and literally wants to murder you even though they’ve never even met you, well, that’s living in the world based on how it truly is. It’s an age of constantly searching for answers but realizing there are none because there are simply no logical answers when it comes to insanity. ” “That’s pretty goddamn sad, but it’s the truth,” Donilon added. According to a majority of Americans, they have mostly come to terms with the fact that they now live in a world where, when an explosion happens, they immediately suspect it’s the result of domestic or foreign terrorism and are fully aware that hoping people died because of an accidental gas leak is morbidly wishful thinking. The U.S. populace also said that seeing the photo of a vacant-eyed suspect appear on their computer screen or watching a recorded message made by someone halfway around the world hours or days after an attack no longer shocks them. In fact, sources confirmed, the nation fully expects it. What reportedly frustrates and angers them most, every citizen in America said, is accepting that there is absolutely nothing they can do to change it. “The lack of control I have when it comes to something as basic as the safety of myself and my family is very upsetting,” 42-year-old Pennsylvania resident Kathy Wells said. “I don’t want to kill anyone. I have   wanted to kill anyone. And yet there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who desperately want to kill me. I don’t know what to expect on a day-to-day basis, but I do tend to think that whatever happens will probably be bad.” Added Wells, “I guess the world’s a pretty fucked-up place, huh?” ",1,This What World Like Now

"POTOSI, MO—Almost two decades after Michael Hollings was put on death row for the murders of 76 men, women, and children across Missouri, evidence uncovered by an exclusive Onion investigation has exonerated him of three of the brutal slayings, restoring his dignity when he thought all had been lost. “I’m so happy to finally have my good name back,” Hollings told reporters Wednesday from his cell at Potosi Correctional Center. “I always told people I could never, ever kill more than 73 people, but when you’re locked in a cage all day, ain’t no one going to hear you out.” “I wish Mama could have seen this,” added a tearful Hollings, in reference to his mother and fourth victim, Barbara Watts-Hollings. “She’d be real proud of her boy today.” Frustrated by the incompetence of his public defender but determined to prove he was innocent of a negligible percentage of the horrific crimes for which he received a death sentence, Hollings wrote to reporters from this newspaper last year, confident they would work tirelessly to see justice done. The Onion’s painstaking investigation, conducted by more than 50 dedicated journalists, revealed that prosecutors suppressed key evidence supporting Hollings’ claim that on the same night he supposedly killed three 7-year-old girls at a slumber party in Blue Springs, he was in fact tearing out the organs of a jogger in the Columbia area. In addition, a DNA test released to reporters by an anonymous law enforcement source demonstrated conclusively that the semen taken from the three girls did not match the semen deposited by Hollings in the mouths, rectums, and eye sockets of his other victims. “It’s hard when everyone thinks you did something terrible that you know you didn’t do,” said Hollings, adding that it made him sick to think of preying upon anyone under the age of 10. “But I’m glad at least you reporter guys believed in me when no one else would. Now I can walk around with my head held higher than it’s been in a long time.” “A lot higher,” added Hollings, cracking a smile. ",1,Investigation Finds Man Wrongfully Imprisoned For 3 Of 76 Murders

"OMAHA, NE—According to FBI sources, the nonprofit media watchdog group Americans for Fairness in Awarding Journalism Prizes, or AFAJP, was ordered to cease operations Friday after its spokesman and president, Stephen Forbeck, was indicted on 24 counts of embezzlement, fraud, and money-laundering. “Over the past 20 years, Mr. Forbeck—aka Thomas Porter, aka Richard Vernon, aka Israel Greenburg, and the list goes on—has gone from media organization to media organization, tricking them all into thinking he could get them the awards they deserve, all while illegally appropriating tens of million dollars in supporter donations for his own personal use,” lead investigator Paul Coughlin told reporters from outside AFAJP’s main office, which, aside from a dozen phones and random sheets of paper strewn across the floor, was completely deserted prior to the FBI raid. “Mr. Forbeck remains at-large at this time. And we’d like to inform all media organizations, especially desperate ones, that as impressive as Mr. Forbeck’s credentials sound, there is no such thing as a J.D. in Journalism Award Giving and Award Law.” At press time, security cameras at Los Angeles International Airport captured an image of a figure resembling Forbeck boarding a flight to Barbados.

"BOSTON—In the aftermath of yesterday’s bombings at the Boston Marathon, which left three dead and over 100 wounded, authorities announced this morning that, sadly, there are actually numerous people who could have carried out the attack. “While many details are still unclear, we can confirm that, as awful and depressing as it is to say, there are actually many, many people out there who would have wanted to set off an explosive device on a crowded street corner full of innocent men, women, and children,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick DesLauriers told reporters, adding that authorities are parsing through all available photo and video evidence in order to narrow down what is, unfortunately but undeniably, a really rather long list of potential suspects. “The fact is, there is a disturbingly high number of people in the world who are capable of planning and executing such an attack, and plenty who would devote a considerable amount of their time and resources to doing so.” “Moreover, while it may sound terrible, scores and scores of people who are alive on this planet right now would actually be able to convince themselves that carrying out a deadly bombing attack on civilians running a marathon would somehow be the right thing to do,” DesLauriers continued. “You really have no idea, honestly, how many people could tell themselves this and believe it with every fiber of their being.” DesLauriers went on to stress that, of the suspects potentially responsible for the attack, there are hundreds more within the United States alone who are in all likelihood planning similar, possibly more devastating attacks in the near future. The FBI special agent also told reporters that, though the knowledge of it makes him completely sick to his stomach, there are conceivably thousands, if not millions, around the world who are unable to carry out such an attack themselves, but actually derived pleasure and joy from the sight of its resulting carnage. “The investigation is ongoing and will probably continue for some time, because there is, appallingly, a true abundance of deranged individuals who would gladly put explosive devices inside trash cans next to where large crowds gather to cheer on their loved ones to the finish line of a race,” said DesLauriers. “Furthermore, there are somehow actual humans currently in existence who would have absolutely no difficulty—no difficulty whatsoever—in bringing themselves to detonate those explosives knowing full well the amount of potential casualties and critical injuries they would cause.” “Tragically, these are the only pieces of information of which we are 100 percent certain,” DesLauriers added. Local officials from the Boston Police Department echoed DesLauriers’ comments, telling reporters that the search for the perpetrators will, unbelievably, require a diligent, around-the-clock search through a shockingly large pool of potential suspects. “Patriots’ Day has long been a tradition in which the people of Massachusetts gather together to eat food, watch sports, and generally enjoy the day with their families and friends, and there are, I truly hate to say, a host of total psychopaths both here and abroad who would go to great lengths to completely rob everyone of that, and to rob us all of whatever trace of innocence and personal well-being we have left,” said Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. “Rest assured, however, we have people working around the clock trying to narrow down the individual or individuals who, heartbreakingly, will be far from the last to attempt something like what happened yesterday.” ",1,"Authorities: Sadly, There Are Many People Who Could Have Done This"

"WASHINGTON—Following FBI reports this morning that the suspects implicated in Monday’s Boston Marathon bombing are of Chechen descent, efforts to thoughtlessly stereotype the alleged terrorists were impeded by the majority of Americans’ lack of basic knowledge about Chechnya or the Chechen people, a new study has confirmed. “Our research shows that, while many Americans would like nothing more than to make sweeping, insensitive generalizations about these two individuals based purely on their ethnic identity, this process is largely impeded by the fact that 9 out of 10 Americans truly know next to nothing about Chechnya, including even the very barest details of what or where Chechnya is,” said lead researcher Dr. Tim Kinane, adding that a majority of American citizens are almost totally unaware of Chechen history and culture, how to locate Chechnya on a map, whether Chechnya is a country or a city or a region, or that a person from Chechnya is called a Chechen. “Clinical trials show that most individuals will make brief, fumbling attempts to stereotype Chechens based on what little they know about Russians, but eventually drop the subject entirely after running out of anything to say within seconds.” Kinane’s team was able to confirm, however, that once research subjects were told Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim region, they were “usually pretty good to go from there.” ",1,Study: Majority Of Americans Not Informed Enough To Stereotype Chechens

"MINNEAPOLIS—After an accident this past weekend in which he tripped down a flight of stairs and fractured a metatarsal in his left foot, sales analyst Tim Morris was suddenly thrown into a strange and unfamiliar world pervaded by human generosity and kindness. According to Morris, 42, within seconds of the painful injury, he abruptly found himself immersed in a curious realm where compassion and consideration from other people was the norm, and fellow human beings exhibited an actual concern for his welfare without any thought of reciprocation. ""Everyone keeps asking me how I'm doing or if there's anything else they can get me, anything at all,"" said Morris, appearing disoriented by the bizarre surge of human decency being directed toward him. ""I went to the bank earlier and a total stranger actually stood there, smiled, and held the door for me for like 30 seconds. That's what it's like literally everywhere I go now."" ""What is this place?"" added Morris, gazing around in confusion. While Morris confirmed that the people of this unusual new world look and sound exactly as they did in the world he hails from, he noted that their displays of unselfish kindness are completely unlike those he is accustomed to experiencing on a day-to-day basis. Adding further confusion, Morris' family and friends have all paid visits to his apartment with seemingly no purpose other than to ""check up"" on him and help him around the house. ""My brother Brian came over earlier today with some homemade soup and told me to call him if I needed anything,"" said Morris, who could not remember the last time his sibling had done anything for him at all, much less offered to buy him groceries. ""Just last month he said he was too busy to pick me up from the airport, and today he's washing my dirty dishes for me."" ""Is that really you, Brian?"" asked Morris, squinting at the man standing by his kitchen sink. Morris also told reporters that people at his office who previously seemed unaware of his presence have suddenly begun treating him as if he were an actual person with feelings. ""My coworker Lisa offered to stop by my place and pick up some presentation materials I needed to bring to work,"" Morris said. ""At first I actually thought it was a joke, and so I laughed. But then she was like, 'No, seriously, I'll swing by your apartment and grab them.' And then she did! I couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it."" ""Where I come from, people just don't do stuff like that,"" Morris added. ""But here it happens all the time. "" Despite constantly waiting for someone to reveal a hidden motive or suddenly attempt to exploit him, Morris has so far faced nothing but kind words and benevolent actions from the people he has come across, an experience that has almost been too disorienting to handle. ""To be honest, it's almost too much, all of the empathy and charitableness,"" Morris said. ""I guess it takes a while to get acclimated or something. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it eventually."" As his fractured foot slowly heals, Morris' doctors have given him four to six weeks before he is spit back out into the cold and unfeeling abyss he came from.

"WATERTOWN, MA—According to the latest news breaking from the scene of the ongoing Boston bomber manhunt, sources asked if anyone can ever truly know anything and, when one actually stops and thinks about it, what is the truth, really? While authorities have continued updating the public on the progress of the manhunt and eyewitnesses have corroborated the stories, reporters have to wonder: How do any of us ever really discern what has “happened” from what has “not happened,” if indeed such terms are mutually exclusive, in the context of spacetime, or even truly knowable? Furthermore, one could potentially view everything we see and hear—or rather, everything we  —as being little more than a string of continuing falsities, one after another, throughout the entirety of our existence. Who can we trust? Is our only option to continue believing everything we experience, in a phenomenological sense, and ignore the true possibility that all that truly is, has been, and will be, is an illusion, a shadow cast upon the wall of eternity?

"I’ve witnessed some sorry fucking sights in my life, but the display you just put on in front of that nursing home crowd was the most pathetic excuse for Christian-themed slapstick I’ve ever seen. Dropped lines, missed cues, and I don’t know what you all thought you were doing during the Ten Commandments skit, but it sure as shit wasn’t what we rehearsed. Come on, are we just a bunch of assholes fucking around here? Or is this a clown ministry? We’ve got standards to live up to. We’re not just some dipshits in polka-dot overalls and fright wigs playing grab-ass. We’re clown ministers—righteous Christians called to preach the word of the Gospels through costumes, props, and physical comedy. Maybe you forgot, but when you put on those big floppy shoes and that Jesus-fish necktie, you’re not just some grease-painted jerk-off standing there with your thumb in your ass. You are a messenger of our Lord and Savior. We’re supposed to be saving souls here—using our comic antics to spread hope, faith, and Christian goodwill. Do you think we opened the audience’s hearts   to the everlasting love of Jesus with that huge stinking turd of a puppet show you just tried to pass off as the parable of the prodigal son? Seriously, are you fuckwits here to share the good news of the Kingdom of Heaven through lighthearted hijinks and pantomime or to yank on your goddamn dicks? Yeah, I’m talking to you, Father Rumplebottom. When you play Judas chasing Saint Glitterbug and Jingles the Penitent around the Last Supper table with a seltzer bottle, you’re supposed to slip and fall on your 30 pieces of silver. That’s the punchline to the whole bit, for crying out loud! Same goes for you, Blowflower T. Hezekiah. A fucking monkey could’ve made a better Immaculate Heart of Mary balloon sculpture than you did this afternoon. Oh, and by the way—just how exactly are we supposed to glorify God with our walls of Jericho tumbling routine when half of you shitheads forgot your trumpets in the van? Do you think the greats, clown ministers like Faithful Bonko or ChooChoo the Prophet, ever phoned it in like that? No. When they were supposed to teach a Sunday school class the story of Noah’s Ark, they got out there and started pulling stuffed animals out of their sleeves, two of each kind, in an endless chain, until they had the attention of every kid in that audience. You can’t just throw on a red nose and an oversized crucifix necklace and expect a group of recovering alcoholics or terminally ill children to invite the Holy Spirit into their hearts right then and there—especially not when you’re out there pissing around like a gaggle of bumbling dildos like you were today. Most of the seniors in that rec room had nodded off by the time we got to Humble Doink’s burning bush ventriloquism act, and with the god-awful snoozefest you just put on, I can’t say I blame them. Look, it’s up to you. If you’d rather sit around and wank each other off than spread the wisdom of the Lord, that’s fine—just go do it somewhere else.

"Whenever I tell people I’m a veterinarian, I see their eyes light up, and I know exactly what’s coming next: “Oh my gosh! It must be so amazing to get to play with cute puppies and kitties all day! You’re so lucky!” But being a vet isn’t just showing up in the morning and then frolicking with adorable animals from open till close. Many people are surprised to learn there’s actually a lot more to it than that. You have to remember, I also get to kill quite a few of the animals. That’s not to say these folks aren’t partially correct. As a doctor of veterinary medicine, it’s true, I really do get to pet some of the cutest, cuddliest furballs you’ve ever laid eyes on. Dozens and dozens of them! But if we’re being totally honest, that really oversimplifies a lot of what a vet does. So I like to gently remind people that another, equally satisfying part of my job is injecting those same cuddly furballs with enough barbiturates to stop their little hearts. Generally, about three or four times a day. When people put themselves in my shoes, I guess it’s easy for them to fantasize about rubbing tummies and handing out treats. And while I don’t want to rain on anyone’s parade, I do think it’s important that I nudge perceptions of my profession a bit more toward reality. This job is hard work, I explain, but one of the most rewarding parts is being able to terminate the lives of cats and dogs and rabbits and other pets. I describe just what it is I get to do: give the animals a powerful sedative so they don’t convulse violently on my examination table, administer a lethal drug, and then sit back and watch while the light fades from their eyes. I also make a point of mentioning that I get to see the looks on owners’ faces when I turn to them and say, “She’s gone.” During an ordinary workday, quite a bit of my time is spent just as people imagine. I meet a variety of lovable dogs and cats, as well as a few more exotic pets like monitor lizards, talking parrots, and Petunia, the potbellied mini pig—one of my favorite patients, and such a character! The work doesn’t stop there, however. Just yesterday, for example, I diagnosed Petunia with chronic myelogenous leukemia and recommended immediate euthanasia to her owner, whose name escapes me. Isn’t that funny? A lot of times you remember the pet’s name and not the owner’s! Anyway, after standing aside and watching the owner’s tearful goodbye, I swiftly dispatched Petunia with a massive dose of pentobarbital. But again, no one is aware of that part of my day, or of the heavy, satisfying thud Petunia’s body made when I tossed her into the incinerator right before I fired it up and cremated her. So I just like to remind people that, yes, it’s fun to play with the animals, but killing them can be very gratifying, too. So next time you meet a veterinarian, sure, you can talk about how great it must be to interact with cute animals for a living—and, believe me, it is—but if you   want to make his or her day, ask about all the different pets they get to put down. I guarantee you’ll make a new friend. Also, with smaller rodents, I get to snap their necks using a cervical dislocation technique.

"To become box office hits, today’s motion pictures require dedicated, hardworking actors with the talent and know-how required to execute a quality performance on screen. While I know you have many good candidates to choose from when casting your production, I believe my experience working on films such as  ,  , and   would make me an excellent addition to your next action feature. With my background and skills, I believe I am a natural fit for a role in your movie. I am a dynamic, motivated worker with a wide-ranging skill set and 30 years of screen-acting experience. I am equally at home whether participating in a fast-paced action sequence, engaging in rapid-fire dialogue, creating chemistry with a potential love interest, or just brooding silently in order to build tension for the next action-filled scene. I have also learned how to perform well under pressure, especially when confronting my primary antagonist during the movie’s climax. Whether you are producing a gritty, hard-R crime film or a family-friendly action-adventure franchise, I am confident I would tackle the challenge with the same effort and enthusiasm I’ve shown in the past as both a cop on the trail of a serial killer and a hero who must race against time to save the world from a deadly threat. During my career, I have excelled in many different work environments, from the American West to the steppes of Tibet to the bleak post-apocalyptic future. I am a self-starter capable of working alone, something I did in   as a man whose backward aging left him isolated. But I’m also passionate about collaborating with others, and in the   trilogy I worked as part of a team that executed high-profile heists. I have extensive leadership experience as well, having headed up the guerrilla unit tasked with killing Nazis in  . In addition to being highly proficient at running across rooftops, putting on accents, firing guns while rolling or jumping, memorizing lines, and falling off of high objects onto lower ones, I am also detail-oriented and able to think outside the box. I am mainly interested in playing a lead role in your movie, but I would be open to accepting a supporting part, and feel I would be integral to your film no matter how I was ultimately cast. As to location, I am very flexible. I would prefer to work within the greater Los Angeles area; however, if you are able to make arrangements for transportation, I would be willing to travel as far as London or Argentina. I am also more than willing to executive-produce, if necessary. Although I’m proud of all the projects I’ve been involved with, I believe my experience working on   best sums up my professional strengths. Not only did it require balancing humor with action, it also presented me with the challenge of having to deliver a new, fresh performance while reprising a well-established role. In the end, my castmates and I not only met the expectations placed on us, but actually exceeded them. I was even recognized for my work with a People’s Choice Award. In sum, I believe my skills and talents make me uniquely qualified to appear in your movie, and I hope you will seriously consider me when casting. If you require any information beyond what can be found in my attached résumé, please contact my references George Clooney and David Fincher.

"There’s something I’ve been meaning to bring up for a while now. I know we’ve talked about it over the years, but we’ve let ourselves get sidetracked from it for too long, and to be honest, the clock is ticking. If we don’t want the opportunity to slip away, we need to act soon. We simply don’t have a whole lot of time left if we’re really serious about killing and eating Jane Goodall.   Look, Jane’s not getting any younger, and she doesn’t come around as often as she used to. We probably don’t have that many chances left. And what are we waiting for anyway? How long have we been saying that one of these days when she least expects it, we’re all going to pounce on her and then feast upon her flesh? Well, that’s not gonna happen unless we get our shit together fast.   Next time she comes by, that’s it. We’ve got to do this. It’s now or never.   Obviously, this should be pretty easy to pull off. She let her guard down around us decades ago. Think about how many times Jane has wandered into a clearing all by herself—right out in the open!—to observe our eating habits or pick up one of our newborns. Well, she’s obviously going to do this again, and that’s when a bunch of us can just swoop down from the trees and tear her to pieces. Seriously, once we’re gorging on her flesh, we’re gonna be kicking ourselves for having waited almost 60 years.   Even if we all agree we should kill her—and, come on, is there anyone who’s not on board at this point?—we’re bound to have some differences of opinion as to the best way to do it. I personally would prefer to bash her skull in with a heavy rock the moment she steps out of her Jeep and walks over to greet us, but I’m open to other suggestions. I’m well aware that some of you are in favor of pulling her limbs off and devouring her dismembered torso, while there’s also a vocal minority that simply wants to squeeze the living breath from her body the next time she moves in for a hug. These are all fine ideas, and I could ultimately get behind any one of them as long as we kill Jane Goodall and  .   She’s 83, for Christ’s sake. We want to eat her while there’s still enough of her to go around.   As for which one of us actually does the killing, I think our best bet is for maybe 15 to 20 of us to close in on her from all sides, so she has absolutely no chance of escaping. In the spirit of fairness, I’d like to see everyone involved get the chance to rip away at least one solid handful of her flesh, but if our alpha male decides he wants to just snap Jane’s neck with a good hard yank of her ponytail, I’m certainly not going to argue.   Now, who gets to eat which parts is something we can decide later, and we definitely should make sure that her heart, lungs, and viscera are distributed appropriately. I’d personally like to lay claim to her face—or at least some part of the head and brain—but what’s most important now is that we’re all on the same page about what’s going to happen the next time this woman shows up. Can we please, please agree on that? It’s way past time we pulled the trigger on this thing.  Besides, think about how great it’s going to be! At this point, there’s   she’ll see it coming. She’ll just be strolling toward our colony with her dumb little notebook in hand like it’s just another ordinary day of studying us and then— —it’s the least ordinary day of her fucking life. I mean, imagine what a letdown it would be if she just dropped dead of natural causes. Sure, we’d still get to eat her, but the thrill would be gone.   Worst of all, we’d never get to see that devastated look on her face as she suddenly realized that we not only never accepted her as one of our own, but also that, from the very first day, we hated her and wanted her dead.

"NEW YORK—Admitting that he initially started to panic upon discovering that federal prosecutors were investigating him for charges of bank and tax fraud, Michael Cohen reportedly expressed relief Monday after remembering that it is illegal to charge a lawyer with a crime. “Wow, I was really freaking out there for a second thinking I was definitely going to prison, but then I remembered you have immunity from all criminal charges when you’re a lawyer,” said Cohen, adding that his concern over the mounting evidence that he was involved in multiple crimes while serving as President Trump’s lawyer disappeared after he recalled the part of getting admitted to the bar that makes questioning a lawyer about anything they’ve ever done a Class A felony. “I can’t believe I almost forgot that lawyers are the part of the legal system who talk about the laws when they prosecute and defend people for crimes, not the people who actually have laws applied to them. Lawyers obviously get attorney–legal system privilege. Jeez, though, that was close.” At press time, Cohen was growing even more relaxed after recalling all the lawyers he knows who have committed scores of illegal acts and never received any punishment whatsoever.

"As someone with decades of experience as a physician, I can assure you that whatever your diagnosis, it pays to be an informed patient. Many conditions have a wide range of treatment options, and to make the decision that’s right for you, it’s important to understand the pros and cons of each. Unfortunately, the general public has a lot of erroneous ideas about the practice of medicine, and to some extent this is due to the popularity of  . Thanks to this so-called Dr. Mario, many people assume we in the medical field solve every problem we encounter by just lobbing a bunch of pills. It has certainly distorted the expectations of the patients who walk into my office. Yes, just like Dr. Mario, I wear a white lab coat and a stethoscope, and yes, I too treat illnesses with pills, when appropriate. But the similarities stop there. People feeling sick come to me and ask, “Do I have the red virus? The blue one? Or is it the yellow?” And whatever the answer, they expect me to fling four pills of that color at their germs. I always find myself explaining that just because there’s a “Dr.” before his name doesn’t mean Mario underwent the same rigorous training as the rest of us. Not by a long shot. A real doctor’s job is to assess a patient’s symptoms, take into account any previous illnesses and genetic predispositions, render a diagnosis, and recommend a treatment. Might that include several courses of antiviral medication? Possibly. Might those drugs be dispensed into a pill bottle? More than likely. But in no scenario would that involve wildly oversized capsules being hurled in a steep arc and, upon their descent into an enormous bottle, emitting a slight beep with each 90-degree midair turn. Still, I’d say nine out of 10 patients I write a prescription for ask me which way the capsule must be rotated to be effective. I can understand the fondness for Dr. Mario. As a young physician, I wanted to be just like him, curing diseases with just a smooth overhand toss of a pill. What doctor wouldn’t want to do that? I also admired the courage and discipline it took for Dr. Mario to earn his medical degree while at the same time managing the day-to-day demands of his job as a plumber. Yet contrary to popular thought, you can’t heal people by simply stacking pills one atop the other, or expedite treatment by making those drugs fall from the ceiling faster. When patients sit down on my exam table, however, the first thing most of them do is ask to see the big clipboard that shows the number of viruses they have and how fast their doctor is getting rid of them. I then have to explain that viruses aren’t even visible to the naked eye, let alone capable of dancing to an 8-bit theme song. I do this at least a dozen times every single day. You see, unlike Dr. Mario, I’m constantly forced to make nuanced, complicated decisions. There are more than three germs out there. And there’s more to medicine than spinning pills in the air and lining them up according to color in columns of four or more. In my practice, I write prescriptions, conduct examinations, order diagnostic tests and scans, and break the bad news to terminally ill patients about how long they have to live. It really is an extremely difficult job. Just yesterday I picked up my forceps and—being ever so careful not to touch the sides of the incision and get shocked—removed an ice cream cone from a man’s skull, successfully treating his brain freeze. For real doctors, it’s all in a day’s work. ",1,‘Dr. Mario’ Has Given Too Many People A Warped Idea Of The Medical Profession

"Well, there we go, Adam. You had to reopen an old wound. I apologize for derailing the discussion, and I will let you make your point in due time, but when provoked with a statement on this subject so staggeringly ignorant as “I actually thought they were pretty fun,” I cannot maintain both my silence and my conscience. The   video games are fraught with glaring shortcomings that I feel duty-bound to report, if only as a warning. Does “fun,” in your own personal glossary, mean seeing a classic motion picture series chewed up and regurgitated as pointless tests of rudimentary motor skill? Or is it time-devouring stretches with no idea where to go or what to do that fill your soul with gladness? This is no rash or ill-considered opinion, mind you. Had the games only lived up to the quality standard of the Lego building sets, I would have been elated. Nor is this a tantrum about the game not matching the movies beat for beat, or misplaced rage over the unforgivable betrayal that was  . The simple fact of the matter is that LucasArts, in cooperation with Traveller’s Tales, wrought two indisputably flawed exercises in tedium and futility with their adaptations of the Indiana Jones films. Allow me to start with  , the first of their two alternately ineffectual and frustrating bagatelles, and a game you said “has some puzzle elements that are kind of cool.” Your assessment is as bewildering to me as it is disappointing, Adam, because from the moment its opening cut-scene ends, the game reveals itself not as an intriguing series of mysteries for the player to solve in pursuit of a priceless artifact, but a tiresome laundry list of errands to be obeyed in strict sequence. Consider: While the Indiana Jones of film punches out Nazis, his mute Lego doppelgänger spends far more time attacking trees and flowers. Indy can scarcely walk five steps without finding a cluster of greenery that he’s compelled to destroy in order to collect the tiny Lego studs that constitute the in-game currency. Even when outrunning the giant boulder—that most iconic moment from  —he’s evidently supposed to risk his life brutalizing the vegetation for a few extra studs. So you’ll understand, Adam, if I’m at a bit of a loss as to what makes this game “pretty fun.” Perhaps the mine-cart chase was what you liked so much? I grant that it was well-animated, but the actual gameplay is a perfunctory exercise in button-pushing that doesn’t challenge one’s reflexes or generate any sense of stakes or peril, making it a tremendous disappointment to anyone with a thoughtful appreciation of  . And the   levels do nothing to redeem the charade, do they? Although I didn’t expect the witty interplay between tiny animated Lego replicas of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery to match the real thing, I also didn’t expect the game to disrespect the source material with so many trite cut-scenes. However, the greatest insult to our intelligence comes in “Chapter 4: Trouble In The Sky,” when Indy and his father must determine what time to set a clock to—and the correct answer appears in plain sight on a wall  , a dead giveaway evoking the laziest of Flash room-escape games.  Frankly, Adam, I would have thought a game this lazy and hackneyed was beneath you. In any case, revisiting the levels in free-play mode proved equally offensive, and a great encroachment upon my time, as I had to pull more than one all-nighter just to 100-percent the game before   came out. The overworld of Barnett College was particularly infuriating, its hallways strewn with furniture for Indy to destroy in order to collect more Lego studs, to be traded for unlockable sundries at nothing less than confiscatory rates. For the above reasons and others, I decided that I could miss  , and for years I lived happily without it, until Ganonball dared impugn my gaming skill on my own Twitch channel—I, who speed-ran   within a hairsbreadth of 90 minutes!—implying that the second installment would be too challenging for me. No, it is not the game’s fault that I chose to defend my honor by vowing to complete it in a single marathon stream, or that Barry at GameStop mischaracterized the sequel as “the original game plus  ,” suggesting it was simply the levels I’d already mastered supplemented with a new chapter. But I soon found myself in alien territory, and I do not mean the Temple of Akator. Nevertheless, I am sure I could have cleared the game in a neat 12 hours were it not so obviously flawed and so full of the inane gameplay that you, Adam, apparently cherish. For your edification, here’s what a banal and unrewarding slog is: finding a hieroglyphics panel, being told you need a character with a book to decode it, going back through Shanghai and India to replay every unlocked level, puttering through every vehicle race in hopes of unlocking a character who has a book, rereading the game instructions, scouring the overworld by plane, and repeating the process for several hours! To be humiliated in such a public forum, with heavyweights like DonkeyPong and WeeGee6502 watching, is an experience I will never, ever live down. This is what happens when you license the John Williams music and assume everything else will fall into place. Did the designers never play a good, puzzle-driven Indiana Jones game like   or  ? I daresay   for the Atari 2600 or even   delivers more intellectual stimulus than your cherished  , Adam. But you know what? Perhaps the problem is with  . Perhaps George Lucas’ vision for Indiana Jones was of a man running around trying 50 different things and hoping the next one finally opens a door. Although I certainly don’t remember Indy and his father painstakingly maneuvering their clumsy motorcycles onto a pair of bright orange switches to get into yet another room to perform yet another mundane task, that may well be a deleted scene I missed on the Blu-rays. And maybe one of Rob MacGregor’s spin-off novels had Indy unlocking the secrets of ancient empires by punching every tree, pot, and piece of furniture in sight, only to lose half the studs he earns negotiating the handholds on inexplicably rotating pillars! And was it a Marvel or Dark Horse comic that featured a juvenile disco-dance scene at what is supposed to be the dramatic peak of the story? My memory is not perfect, so perhaps I forgot about an episode of   in which Indy drives around a quarter-square-mile area collecting 10 balloons to make a golden treasure chest appear. Yes, that would explain everything far better than breathtakingly incoherent game design. So, Adam, when I speak of shortcomings, heed well my words, as they come from hard-won experience. Anyway, go ahead with your point about  . ",1,I Did Warn You Not To Get Me Started On The Shortcomings Of The ‘Lego Indiana Jones’ Games

"SAN JOSE, CA—With estimates ranging from “two marshmallows smushed together” to “the size of a basketball,” fourth-graders at Greystone Elementary differed in opinion over how much their allergic classmate’s face swelled up during recess, sources said Friday. “Caleb said Eric’s face puffed up like a bag of microwave popcorn, but it wasn’t even half that size,” said 9-year-old Dillon Porter, adding that multiple reports of the inflammation being purple and oozing were also inaccurate. “And then Katie said his forehead got all huge, but she wasn’t nearly as close as me or Ryan were. It might have gotten a little lumpy over one of his eyes, but that’s it. He did sort of look like a puffer fish, though, like Brendan said.” Porter went on to say that despite the controversy over the proportions of the allergic reaction, all agreed it was the grossest thing they’d ever seen.

"Perhaps the greatest joy in writing fiction lies in the opportunity to fashion an entire world of one’s own devising. As an author, I can bring to life strange, wondrous characters and have them say or do anything I want. Sometimes, I grow so fond of my creations that I long for them to be real, and that’s especially true of the lawyers who fill my books. Oh, how I wish such a fantastical profession could exist outside my novels! Can you imagine a world in which attorneys were real, actually living among us and practicing law? What could be more amazing than that? When I sit down to write, I let my creativity run wild, populating my fiction with principled men and women who roam august “courtrooms” in outlandish three-piece suits and deliver arguments based on arcane knowledge they have gleaned from dusty old tomes. To flesh out this whimsical world, I have my lawyers train at institutions like the intensely competitive Harvard Law School, which I created for my 1991 novel,  . They then must take special tests to gain admittance to mysterious “state bar associations.” I’ve even invented an entirely new tongue that attorneys alone can speak, filled with peculiar words like “amicus curiae,” “tort,” and “writ of certiorari.” After spending so much time with my characters, I can’t help but wonder what it would be like if lawyers were a part of   world, walking among us with their briefcases and their most curious affidavits! For me, the magical journey all began with criminal defense attorney Jake Brigance, the protagonist I introduced in my first novel,  . I dreamed up special powers for him, including the subpoena, with which he can make people appear at trial against their will, and the cross-examination, which he can use to dispel testimony from a witness conjured by opposing counsel. I created all kinds of lawyers: Brigance was soon joined by the prosecutor Rufus Buckley, a dastardly opponent with an otherworldly ability to transport people to prison, and the divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner, an unlikely ally who could make marriages vanish into thin air! Whenever I so much as   about lawyers, I’m instantly whisked away to a fanciful world I don’t ever want to leave. It might seem silly, but just picture for a moment what it would be like if you could simply hire a lawyer and take someone to court. And what if you could bring your case before a judge, just like the kind you find in my books? While in court, you might encounter a jury, too. Ah, the cautious, deliberating jury! My second-favorite creation after lawyers. I’m reminded of the day in the mid-1980s when I was at the grocery store, mired in writer’s block over how these so-called cases would reach a verdict, when I rounded the corner and picked up a carton of eggs. That’s when it hit me—a 12-person jury! With all the marvels involving prosecutors, defenders, judges, juries, and the rest of the court, can you really blame me for wishing this enchanted realm was real life? But while I do eagerly indulge in such fantasies from time to time, I’m not as zealous as some of my diehard fans are. I’ve met people at book signings who have convinced themselves they really are lawyers. I mean, at a certain point, it’s honestly kind of sad. ",1,I Sometimes Wish Lawyers Existed Outside The Fantastical World Of My Novels
"Guess what? There is this really neat literary device I just learned about, and it's called ""foreshadowing."" It's this thing where, in the beginning of the story, you put in all these little ""hints"" about stuff that's going to happen later on. I can't wait to try it out! I think the best part about foreshadowing is that it doesn't come right out and tell everyone what's going to happen. Instead, it does this thing called ""planting a seed"" in the reader's mind, so that the ending will still be a surprise but also seem logical. At least that's what it said on WritersZone.com, which is a really good site with lots of fun tips on writing. Foreshadowing is awesome. You can foreshadow anything. One thing you can foreshadow is a high-powered attorney billing the hours, making the money, and rushing relentlessly up the corporate ladder of a giant D.C. law firm, and then in an instant, it all comes undone. I am definitely going to try foreshadowing that. Another thing I like is that you can put foreshadows in anywhere: in the dialogue, in the descriptions, even in the rising action. I suppose you could even plot out the whole story arc ahead of time, before you start writing, and put in the hints as you go along. Usually I just sit down and start typing, and then come up with a climax when I get to 450 pages. I wish I had learned about this foreshadowing technique earlier. Like, in the beginning of  —this story I wrote about a junior attorney who pulls off the white-collar crime of the century—I could have put in some ""clues"" that the guy's lover is greedy or evil. That would have ""foreshadowed"" the end where she steals all his money. That would've been so cool! Foreshadowing also builds suspense. I used to think the only way you could build suspense was with rising action. Or maybe with the climax. But with foreshadowing, you can ""build expectations"" that make the reader want to keep reading to find out what's being foreshadowed. Now I think foreshadowing is the coolest way to hold the reader's attention. There is also something called a ""red herring,"" which is another thing I just found out about, which is like foreshadowing except the thing you foreshadow doesn't happen. A red herring is like a trick. I don't think I want to use a red herring. Going back to foreshadowing, you can foreshadow in a bunch of different ways. You could have a character say something that foreshadows something else, or you could use events to foreshadow later events. I think my favorite way is using a single word with two different meanings to foreshadow. For example, I learned that if a notorious D.C. power broker who knows a secret that goes to the top of the U.S. government is going to die, it's better to have him say ""I'd rather die than go to prison"" than something like ""I would never want to go to prison."" Because the first way has the word ""die"" in it, and then he does die. Foreshadowing is so much better than rising action. I was talking to my friends James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell the other day, and they told me about this new thing called ""symbolism,"" where you make one object ""represent"" another more ""abstract"" concept. Like, in my new story about a brash young attorney straight out of Harvard Law who's standing on the brink of a brilliant career and risks it all for a death-row convict and an impossible case, I could make the inmate's scar stand for something. It could stand for the judicial system, or for peace. In fact, depending on the way I ""describe"" it, I could make it stand for just about anything. This is all so exciting. I'm going to go write a new story right now!  ",1,"Now That I've Learned About Foreshadowing, I'm Going To Use It In All Of My Stories"
"WASHINGTON—Signaling an alarming and dangerous trend for the nation’s motorists, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report Friday revealing that four out of five traffic accidents are caused by drivers taking their eyes off the road to ogle shirtless hunks. The report confirmed that in 2013, more than 7 million passenger cars and light trucks were involved in minor collisions, rollovers, and multi-vehicle accidents that resulted from drivers who were distracted by checking out the taut and tanned muscles of gorgeous young studs. “Our data indicates that gawking at the washboard abs of a grade-A beefcake jogging on the sidewalk, even for just a few seconds, dramatically increases the likelihood of driver error and crash risk,” said DOT spokesperson Hugh Tucker, noting that looking in the side mirror for another quick peek at a smoking hot landscaper wiping sweat from his brow was the country’s leading cause of rear-end crashes. “Unfortunately, many motorists assume they can safely gape at bare-chested man-meat, but the sight of perfectly chiseled pectoral muscles glistening in the sun can often prove to be so mesmerizing that drivers don’t look away before drifting into another lane of traffic.” “When you turn your attention away from steering to rubberneck at a totally ripped dreamboat, you are needlessly endangering yourself and everyone on the road,” added Tucker. According to the Department of Transportation, approximately 7,000 drivers per day do a double take of a bronze-skinned hunk’s rock-hard torso, bite their lip, and then mouth the words “oh my” as they carelessly swerve into a guardrail or over a curb. In addition, the use of a handheld device to shoot a quick photo of a mouth-watering studmuffin’s broad, rippling shoulders has contributed to 20 percent of all accidents reported to police. Experts stressed that certain stretches of road can prove especially dangerous, particularly in summer months, when strapping heartthrobs with firm bods are more likely to forgo a shirt while mowing the lawn or playing football with a group of equally buff hotties. “Areas with a high density of muscular eye candy are quite treacherous—traffic generally slows down to take a good look at sinewy Adonises along running routes or near construction sites, and it often leads to a lot of congestion and fender benders,” said highway safety advocate George Proval. “That intersection at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica is essentially a death trap.” “I’ve personally seen a number of multiple-car pileups that were the direct result of drivers craning their necks to bask in the full glory of a brawny hunk spotting for another waxed, oiled-up slab of manflesh pumping iron,” he added. Proval cautioned that when motorists encounter a delectable, musclebound looker, they should immediately pull over to the curb or highway shoulder, stop the vehicle, and drink in every square inch of the powerful, hard-bodied stud before proceeding to their destination. Topeka, KS resident Lauren Hyde told reporters she learned firsthand that, in just the short span of time it takes to get an eyeful of a tantalizing, powerfully built hunk wringing out a soapy sponge, control of the vehicle has already been lost. “I was driving over to my sister’s place a few months ago when I noticed a unit of volunteer firefighters holding a carwash fundraiser,” said Hyde, who was recently involved in a collision after her sedan spun out across the median into oncoming traffic. “The last thing I remember was saying, ‘Come to mama,’ and then I woke up in a hospital bed.” “I keep replaying that moment over and over in my head,” Hyde continued. “I just wish I could have gotten one more glance at his sexy six-pack.” ",1,Report: 80% Of All Traffic Accidents Caused By Drivers Gawking At Shirtless Hunks
"WASHINGTON—Saying she had proven herself to be a formidable contender worthy of respect, GOP leaders announced Thursday that Carly Fiorina had been officially promoted to a male candidate after her strong showing in last night’s primary debate. “Given her steady rise in the polls and her consistent performance on the national stage, we have determined that Ms. Fiorina’s skills as a speaker and compelling ideas about foreign and domestic policy merit her recognition as male,” said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, adding that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO had impressed GOP officials with her breadth of knowledge, her confidence, and her ability to doggedly attack both Democrats and her primary opponents, and therefore deserved to have the label of “female” removed entirely. “We are pleased to be able to offer Ms. Fiorina the increased respect and media coverage that come with being a male candidate. Allow me to be the first to congratulate him and say that he has certainly earned it.” Priebus added that the committee was still reviewing Marco Rubio’s performance, but was strongly considering promoting him to white.

"TOPEKA, KS—Having finally built up the courage to raise her hand and voice her opinions in front of her peers and teachers, local 15-year-old Olivia Kushnick is reportedly now talking enough in class for others to begin criticizing her speaking voice, sources confirmed Monday. “She used to rarely say anything, but in the past couple weeks she’s grown confident enough to answer questions out loud, opening herself up to endless ridicule of her high-pitched, kind of childish-sounding voice,” said English teacher Pat Reese, noting that the ninth-grader’s slower-than-average delivery and tendency to trail off at the end of long sentences have been regularly mocked and derided by her classmates, as well as several of her teachers, since she began showing a willingness to participate in group discussions. “She often speaks with an inflection that makes it hard to tell if she’s making a statement or asking a question, which I frustratedly point out to her every time I hear it. Plus, she has kind of a nasally voice, which she really never hears the end of from the rest of the class.” When reached for comment, Kushnick told reporters she was considering going back to her old habit of stoically saying nothing throughout the school day when she was simply judged by others to be a stuck-up bitch.

"MEDFORD, MA—With the methodical focus of an elite Special Forces unit, relatives of Tufts University senior Hayley Goldschmidt drew up final plans on Tuesday for maneuvering her grandmother Diane Goldschmidt, 81, comfortably through the school’s upcoming commencement ceremony. According to sources, the eight-and-a-half-hour graduation day campaign, split into indoor and outdoor phases, will reportedly involve transporting the mobility-limited octogenarian to and from her hotel of origin, securing a seat for her near the stage, maintaining food and water supplies, and navigating as many as five trips to the bathroom. “Once we’re on the ground, it’s going to be chaotic,” mission leader and main coordinator of logistics Dennis Goldschmidt, 54, told a group of gathered family members as well as Hayley herself, who was patched into the briefing via speakerphone uplink. “You’re going to have thousands of people all trying to do the same thing at the same time, so the goal is to get Grandma in, see Hayley get her diploma, and get her out as quickly as possible with minimum fuss.” “We meet outside the hotel lobby at exactly 7:45 a.m.,” he added. “Then we move.” After confirming that all family members would remain in direct contact throughout the high-risk operation, Goldschmidt reportedly outlined the precise route from the hotel to the university their two-car convoy would take, including an alternate emergency route should unforeseen traffic prove too heavy. Upon arrival to campus, he explained, three people would exit the forward vehicle and take up positions flanking their grandmother, escorting her to her seat while he doubled back to the parking lot. Goldschmidt said that approximately 15 minutes before the start of the ceremony, he would rendezvous with the rest of the group, making a supply drop of camera equipment, water bottles, a stack of programs, and a wallet-sized magnifying glass. Then, sources confirmed, “Grandma will take her pills.” “Once the Academic Procession starts, there’s no getting up—we’ve got to be ready for any possible contingency,” Goldschmidt said, forcefully reminding the group that they could be pinned down by ceremonial observances for two hours or longer. “I want a portable seat cushion in case they don’t have one there, backup batteries for her travel fan, and a handkerchief for her sunglasses.” “And that walker better be unfolded and ready to roll the moment the last diploma is distributed,” he added, plotting a set of waypoints to an area behind the student union where the group would mobilize for family photos. According to sources with knowledge of this phase of the operation, “Grandma pictures” would take place on a bench that advance scouts said would provide sufficient shade cover. The group reportedly hopes to avoid a repeat of 2009, when, at Hayley’s brother’s graduation from Georgia Tech, the elder matriarch grew fatigued in the afternoon heat, forcing the family to call in a golf cart and make a tactical retreat to an air-conditioned tent. “Assuming all has gone to plan, we will then extract Grandma from the campus and transport her to the hotel, where she will have her nap from 3 to 4,” Goldschmidt said. “That should give her a wide enough window to have her tea, freshen up, and be ready for our 5:30 dinner reservation.” At press time, a concerned Goldschmidt was gathering intelligence on the weekend weather and planning for a worst-case scenario in which a designated member from his unit would have to hold an umbrella over Grandma’s head all morning.

"SEATTLE–After a decade of aggressive expansion throughout North America and abroad, Starbucks suddenly and unexpectedly closed its 2,870 worldwide locations Monday to prepare for what company insiders are calling “Phase Two” of the company’s long-range plan.  “Starbucks has completed the coffee-distribution and location establishment phase of its operation, and is now ready to move into Phase Two,” read a statement from Cynthia Vahlkamp, Starbucks’ chief marketing officer. “We have enjoyed furnishing you with coffee-related beverages and are excited about the important role you play in our future plans. Please pardon the inconvenience while we fortify the second wave of our corporate strategy.”  Though the coffee chain’s specific plans are not known, existing Starbucks franchises across the nation have been locked down with titanium shutters across all windows. In each coffee shop’s door hangs the familiar Starbucks logo, slightly altered to present the familiar mermaid figure as a cyclopean mermaid whose all-seeing eye forms the apex of a world-spanning pyramid.  Those living near one of the closed Starbucks outlets have reported strange glowing mists, howling and/or cowering on the part of dogs that pass by, and electromagnetic effects that cause haunting, unearthly images to appear on TV and computer screens within a one-mile radius. Experts have few theories as to what may be causing the low-frequency rumblings, half-glimpsed flashes of light, and periodic electronic beeps emanating from the once-busy shops.  In addition, newly painted trucks marked with the nuclear trefoil, the biohazard warning symbol, and various mystic runes of the Kaballah have been spotted rolling out of Starbucks distribution warehouses.  A spokesman for Hospitality Manufacturing, a restaurant-supply company that does business with Starbucks, provided some insight as to what Phase Two might entail.  “This week, they cancelled their usual 500,000-count order of Java Jackets and ordered 1.2 million Starbucks-insignia armbands instead,” Hospitality Manufacturing’s Jasper Hennings said. “They also called off their standing order for restaurant-grade first-aid kits, saying they had a heavy-duty source for those now. And, most ominous of all, they’ve stopped buying stirrers altogether.”  “I don’t like the looks of this,” added Hennings before disappearing late Monday night.  No Starbucks employees were available for comment, as those not laid off in January’s “loyalty-based personnel restructuring” or hospitalized in the series of freakish, company-wide milk-steamer malfunctions that severely scalded hundreds of employees, have been sent to re-training centers.  Remaining Starbucks employees earmarked for re-training are being taught revised corporate procedures alongside 15,500 new hires recently recruited from such non-traditional sources as the CIA retirement program, Internet bulletin boards frequented by former Eagle Scouts, and the employment section in the back of   magazine.  More insight into Phase Two was provided by the company’s most recent quarterly stockholders’ report, which features a map of North America showing the location of every existing Starbucks. Lines drawn between the various stores form geometric patterns across the U.S., including five-pointed stars, Masonic symbols, and, in the Seattle area, the image of a gigantic Oroborous serpent wrapped around an inverted ziggurat.  Starbucks management has been tight-lipped regarding the upcoming changes. No upper-level executives have been seen in public since the first of the month, and no details seem to be forthcoming. Visitors to the Starbucks web site, however, are greeted with a letter from Starbucks founder Howard Schultz reading in part:  “To our valued Starbucks customer: Just wait until you see the exciting changes we’ve got in store for you as part of our new Phase Two. When you finally see what we’ve got brewing here at Starbucks, you’ll have no choice but to love it.” ",1,Starbucks To Begin Sinister 'Phase Two' Of Operation
"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to help open new doors for the many women struggling to readjust to life after performing, officials from the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists spoke to reporters Thursday about the union’s new job-training program for 30-year-old actresses who have aged out of the workforce. SAG-AFTRA officials, who said the vast majority of female performers are not prepared for the hardships of losing acting work at the end of their 20s, described the wide variety of tools the new program utilizes—ranging from instructional seminars, to networking events, to hands-on workshops—to help transition women into positions in film production, distribution, and financing. “As actresses enter their 30s, they suddenly find themselves without a job and nowhere to turn; we want to ensure that they have the skills to find meaningful employment elsewhere in the industry,” said SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard, who added that through the retraining program, nearly 85 percent of unemployed actresses are able to secure jobs in behind-the-scenes fields within 18 months. “Too often, these performers are cast aside after their on-screen usefulness has run its course, and they fall through the cracks. We’re here to help them get back on their feet.” “Many of these women have dedicated themselves to their craft for up to a decade, and it’s our turn to pay them back,” Howard continued. According to the program’s website, women who enroll are entitled to free instructional classes—which meet in the basement of the union’s headquarters—geared toward teaching the basics of production jobs such as sound mixing, organizing receipts for on-set expenses, wardrobe supervision, and properly handling pyrotechnics. Former actresses can also attend résumé workshops where career coaches will assist them in showcasing any relevant job experience they may have had prior to their careers in acting, such as highlighting previous restaurant work to help them land a position in craft services. The placement program reportedly also provides the women with experiential training, including apprenticeships that pair former A-list stars with professionals in a field of interest such as prop masters or the actresses’ own former personal assistants. Highlighting the success of the program, administrators noted that Oscar winner Michelle Williams, who spent four months shadowing a line producer at Universal Studios, is now working there full-time as a location scout. SAG-AFTRA officials told reporters they are currently developing a web portal that will include job listings from production companies looking to hire female performers who are now beyond on-camera working age. “It can certainly come as a shock to many of these women when they realize they are losing jobs to a younger generation of workers,” said Howard, noting that many struggling older actresses often overestimate their ability to secure the extremely limited number of Hollywood’s divorcee, witch, and unstable or overbearing mother roles. “We try to explain to them that if they want to stay in the industry, they’ll need to show employers that they have something to offer beyond compelling performances.” “The sooner they accept that and take action, the sooner they’ll be back in show business,” he continued. Howard added that the union also offers services intended to preempt women from becoming unemployed in the first place, citing counseling sessions for performers in their mid-20s designed to help them map out a path to careers in marketing or accounting in order to make the jump as seamless as possible. “After I stopped getting roles, I felt very lost and afraid; this was the job I’d spent my whole life training for, and it was all I’d ever really known,” said former actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, 37, who explained that, with the help of the program, she has found steady work as a best boy electric on Hollywood films and was recently hired as the gaffer on the upcoming movie  . “The workshops and coaching sessions gave me the confidence and skills to begin a new chapter in my career, and I’m extremely thankful for that.” “I’m glad my daughter can see that even though her mother is no longer able to get work on the screen, she can still contribute in her own small way,” she added.

"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Starbucks, the nation’s largest coffee-shop chain, continued its rapid expansion Tuesday, opening its newest location in the men’s room of an existing Starbucks.  “Coffee lovers just can’t stand being far from their favorite Starbucks gourmet blends,” said Chris Tuttle, Starbucks vice-president of franchising. “Now, people can enjoy a delicious Frappuccino or espresso just about any time they please, even while defecating.”  The new men’s-room-based Starbucks, the coffee giant’s 1,531st U.S. location, will be open to both men and women when not “in use.” In addition to offering specialty coffees from around the world, it will serve freshly baked pastries, Italian pannini sandwiches and soups, as well as the rest room’s usual selection of toilet paper and soap.  “This is a great addition,” said Jonathan Connolly, a Boston-area banker who tried out the new Starbucks Tuesday. “I was enjoying my usual triple mocha latté in the main Starbucks, and I had to go to the bathroom, where three people were in line to use the stalls. The wait might have been a problem, but, to my great pleasure, there was another Starbucks right there, ready to serve me more delicious coffee. And the baristas were helpful and courteous.”  Connolly added that after he finished drinking his coffee and using the bathroom, he stayed for a poetry reading near the urinals.  “I was a little bit worried about the new restaurant cutting into our business,” said Dave Grobelkowski, manager of the original Starbucks. “But the only people going there are ones who have already purchased items from us anyway. And if we run out of stirrers or cream, we can just go to the bathroom and borrow some.”  According to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, the new location represents the beginning of a long-term expansion plan.  “Eventually, Starbucks rest rooms everywhere will sell coffee,” Schultz said. “But that ambitious scheme is at least five years down the road. In the meantime, we plan to open an additional location in this Starbucks’ ladies’ room within months, and are already drafting plans for a fourth restaurant along the corridor leading from the main seating area to the rest rooms. At some point a ‘Star-bucks Express’ window will eventually open in the walk-in closet of the men’s room Starbucks.”  “Drink our coffee,” Schultz said. “Drink it.” ",1,New Starbucks Opens In Rest Room Of Existing Starbucks

"WASHINGTON—In what many are hailing as the most significant development in the history of space exploration, NASA scientists announced Thursday that a planet seemingly identical to Earth has been discovered by the agency’s Orbital Space Mirror. According to NASA, the $2.9 billion aluminum glass mirror, which stretches over 180 feet wide and 147 feet tall, has already produced invaluable data suggesting that our solar system may contain a terrestrial planet of the exact same size, shape, and surface composition as Earth. “This is a historic moment for humankind to confirm the existence of another planet that is almost indistinguishable from our own,” said mission leader Allen Brugel, who explained that after releasing the Orbital Mirror from a Delta IV heavy rocket at an operational altitude of 104,000 miles, the team received almost instantaneous images of an Earth-like planet approximately 208,000 miles away. “It is remarkable to find another celestial body where water is not only present but also covers two-thirds of the planet’s entire surface. What may be even more surprising is that it was discovered in a part of space that was previously thought to be completely empty.” “It turns out that, in a universe that’s 93 billion light years wide, a planet perfectly suited for human life was right next to us in our own solar system,” Brugel added. Built by NASA as part of a program created to identify planets in the galaxy capable of sustaining life, sources confirmed the orbiting plane mirror has provided scientists with continuous, real-time reflections of light rays since its launch in late October. Scientists cited numerous key similarities between the newly discovered planet and our own, including the celestial body’s landmasses, oceans, wind patterns, cloud formations, apparent vegetation, and set of polar ice caps that strikingly resemble those found on Earth. Sources added that NASA’s preliminary surveys indicate that the recently detected body even completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours and that, even more remarkably, its axial tilt is believed to also be exactly 23.5 degrees. NASA scientists added that the new planet also possesses a single moon, though they noted that it appears to orbit and rotate in the complete opposite direction as Earth’s. “Perhaps most fascinating is the significant amount of evidence indicating that sentient life may already be present on this new planet,” said Brugel, noting that portions of the planet’s surface are illuminated by artificial light at night, a phenomenon scientists say is most prevalent in the planet’s northern hemisphere. “We suspect they may be a significantly advanced society, as our mirror imaging system confirms that there are numerous sophisticated satellites circling the planet.” “Beyond that, we can only begin to speculate what types of beings such a planet could produce,” he added. According to sources, a recent unmanned mission to land on the body’s surface was aborted after discovering that life forms on the planet had launched a probe traveling at the same speed on a flight path identical to that of the NASA team. Internal NASA reports indicate that a potential head-on collision was narrowly avoided when both crafts simultaneously changed course at the last second. “Overall, we’re pleased with our initial findings, and I believe the project has made excellent use of the lessons learned from the Helios Space Lens,” said Brugel, referring to an ill-fated mission in 1992 to provide advanced imaging of the sun using convex lens technology, an experiment which burned down NASA headquarters. “And after further studying deep space via the Orbital Mirror, we also determined that the universe appears to be perfectly symmetrical, a shocking finding that challenges all of our previously held theories.” At press time, NASA had reportedly launched its Orbital Space Mirror 2 to the side of Earth opposite that of its original Orbital Space Mirror, leading scientists to conclude that there may actually be an infinite number of Earth-like planets stretching outward forever in a straight line through space.

"ITHACA, NY—According to a study released this week by geneticists at Cornell University, substantial evidence indicates that rich people and poor people—disparate populations long thought to be entirely unrelated—may have once shared a single common ancestor. “After conducting careful DNA analysis, our research team was taken aback to discover that the wealthy and the working class actually have a considerable number of genetic similarities,” said study co-author Kenneth Chang, adding that despite the disparity between the modern-day affluent and low earners in terms of behavior, appearance, and lifestyle, numerous genetic markers revealed that their predecessors may have once lived beside one another without any noticeable differences. “Side by side, poor people and rich people look almost nothing alike, of course. It took months of chromosomal comparison to discover that links exist between, say, a top-level consultant at Bain Capital living in a gated community and a mother of three relying on multiple low-wage jobs to survive. And upon close inspection, it is possible to detect subtle, but striking, physical resemblances between these vastly different peoples.” Scientists also determined that the ultra-rich were closely related to jellyfish and other soft-bodied invertebrates.

"TOPEKA, KS—Twenty-eight-year-old Brian Roberson became the sole heir of his late grandfather Herman Roberson's lifetime savings in Camel Cash Tuesday, when he inherited a shoe box filled with 5,800 C-notes. ""To think that a fortune was stashed right behind the cinderblock in the garage all this time,"" Roberson said, adding that his grandpa always stressed the importance of planning for the future. ""He could have bought all the promotional collapsible camping chairs he wanted, but instead he put it away for his grandkid. That's the kind of man he was.""

"CORAL GABLES, FL—Saying that she had given the decision considerable thought, local high school senior Katie Simmons told reporters Monday that she would be applying to Bristol College, a school where her family had donated funds for a new 50,000-square-foot library. “There are so many great choices out there, but I feel like I should at least consider Bristol,” said the 17-year-old, noting that while she would like to go somewhere that has a strong academic reputation and a vibrant social scene, it couldn’t hurt to apply to the institution where her family handed over the largest single gift in the school’s history to construct a new state-of-the-art library and digital media center. “Bristol’s a pretty good school, and I could definitely picture myself there, so I guess there’s no harm in filling out the application, right?” Simmons added that she was keeping her options open by also applying to the school whose president plays golf with her dad once a month.

"MONACO—Saying he feels destined for something different than his Lamborghini-driving, Dom Pérignon–guzzling peers, 17-year-old Jean-François Cambora told reporters Tuesday he doesn’t want to be a Monaco townie forever, stuck in the European city-state living the all-too-common life of a cosmopolitan playboy. “Look at my friends—in 10 years they’ll probably all still be here, still living in their parents’ mansions, racing Formula One cars on the professional circuit, spending their days just sailing around on one of their 150-foot mega yachts,” said Cambora, predicting that few if any of his classmates would ever hold down a full-time job. “Not me. I’m not falling into that trap.” “No, as soon as I turn 18, I’m packing up and hopping the first Gulfstream G550 out of this town,” he added. A defiant Cambora said he refused to accept the fate so readily embraced by his family members, most of whom never venture beyond the same 15-block radius and are content to pass their time playing jai alai, dining on rare caviar flown in nightly from all corners of the globe, and competing in Grand Prix qualifying sessions. The high school student also remarked that he doesn’t want to become “one of those losers” who hangs around after graduation, still playing in the same high-stakes poker games with the same boring €25,000 buy-ins. According to Cambora, nothing could be worse than a life of pure leisure spent hanging out with a bunch of lame Monégasques at exclusive VIP parties where the only topics of conversation are private islands, thoroughbred racehorse pedigrees, lucrative investments in the diamond-mining industry, and which friends are launching new fashion lines next season. “Take my buddy Emile, for example,” Cambora said. “I hate to say it, but he’s probably going to end up another one of those burnouts who sends remote bidders to Art Basel every year and buys shipping containers full of avant-garde light installations for his eight-bedroom neoclassical penthouse. Then there’s my deadbeat friend Maurice, who regularly gets wasted on vintage ports and sleeps with so many gorgeous models he can’t even remember which ones are Corsican and which are Niçoise anymore.” “I’m sorry, but that’s just not the life for me,” he added. The teenager told reporters he understands how easy it is for people to grow comfortable in an extravagant pleasure dome in which their every desire is catered to, they don’t have to pay income taxes, and they can literally speed through the streets in race cars outfitted with diamond-encrusted steering wheels, but he said that was all the more reason for a young man to get out while he still can. “My parents are a case in point,” Cambora said. “They got sucked into this place, and every weekend they’re up in their luxury box at Stade Louis II with the same old dukes and duchesses, rehashing the same old gossip about who’s adding a second heliport to their palazzo, or who just spent nine figures on a de Kooning masterpiece to hang in the foyer of their guest château.” “I can’t wait to get away from all this,” he continued. “Right now my plan is to move into a sprawling old manse down in Cannes or maybe Saint-Tropez, just to see what else life has to offer, you know?” ",1,Monaco Teen Doesn’t Want To Fall Into Townie Life Of Being Billionaire Race-Car-Driving Playboy
"HAZELWOOD, MO—Twenty-six years after Ronald Reagan first set his controversial fiscal policies into motion, the deceased president's massive tax cuts for the ultrarich at last trickled all the way down to deliver their bounty, in the form of a $10 bonus, to Hazelwood, MO car-wash attendant Frank Kellener. ""Back when Reagan was in charge, I didn't think much of him,"" Kellener, 57, said, holding up two five-dollar bills nearly three decades in the making. ""But who would have thought that in 2007 I'd have this extra $10 in my pocket? He may not have lived to see it, but I'm sure President Reagan is up in heaven smiling down on me right now."" Leading economists say Kellener's unexpected windfall provides the first irrefutable proof of the effectiveness of Reagan's so-called supply-side economics, and shows that the former president had ""incredible, far-reaching foresight."" ""When the tax burden on the upper income brackets is lifted, the rich and not-rich alike all benefit,"" said Arthur Laffer, who was a former member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board. ""Eventually.""  The $10 began its long journey into Kellener's wallet in 1983, when a beefed-up national defense budget of $210 billion enabled the military to purchase advanced warhead-delivery systems from aerospace manufacturer Lockheed. Buoyed by a multimillion-dollar bonus, then-CEO Martin Lawler bought a house on a 5,000-acre plot in Montana. When a forest fire destroyed his home in 1986, Lawler took the federal relief check and invested it in a savings and loan run by a Virginia man named Michael Webber. After Webber's firm collapsed in 1989, and he was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, he retained the services of high- powered law firm Rabin & Levy for his defense. After six years and $7 million in legal fees, Webber received only a $250,000 fine, and the defense team went out to celebrate at a Washington, D.C.-area restaurant called Di Forenza. During dinner, lawyer Peter Smith overheard several investment bankers at an adjoining table discussing a hot Internet start-up that was about to go public. Smith took a portion of his earnings from the Webber case and bought several hundred shares in Gadgets.com, quadrupling his investment before selling them four months later. Gadgets.com's two founders used the sudden influx of investment capital to outfit their office with modern Danish furniture, in a sale brokered by the New York gallery Modern Now! in 1998. After the ensuing dot-com bust, Modern Now! was forced out of business, and Sotheby's auction house was put in charge of liquidating its inventory. The commission from that auction enabled auctioneer Mary Schafer to retire to the Ozark region of Missouri in 2006. Last month, while passing through Hazelwood, she took her Audi to Marlin Car Wash, where Kellener was one of the employees who tended to her car. She was so satisfied with the job that she left a $50 tip, which the manager divided among the people working that day. ""This money didn't just affect one life,"" Laffer said. ""It affected five."" Prior to joining Marlin Car Wash in 2005, Kellener worked for nearly two decades at  a  local Ford assembly plant that is now defunct. Before that, he was employed by the FAA as an air traffic controller until his union went on strike and Reagan fired him, along with nearly 13,000 others. This is the largest tip he has received in his professional life. ""I thought Reaganomics was nothing more than a mirage that allowed President Reagan to reward his wealthy support base,"" Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) said. ""But two generations later I am seeing Reaganomics in action, and I like what I see. It just took a little longer than I thought it was supposed to."" The tip has not gone unnoticed by the economic team in the current administration. ""Had Mr. Kellener received that money in 1981, like the Democrats wanted, it would only be worth $4.24 today because of inflation,"" Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said during an official announcement of the economic policy's success at a press conference Monday. ""Instead, Kellener has a solid $10 to spend right here and now. The system works, and our current president intends to keep making it work."" Kellener, who has cared for his schizophrenic sister ever since her federally funded mental institution was closed in 1984, said that he plans to donate the full $10 to the Republican presidential candidate who best embodies Reagan's legacy.

"As a member of what might be called the ""ultrarich,"" I have attended some of the finest soirees in the most elegant surroundings in the world. Naturally, I have consumed all manner of hors d'oeuvres on any number of snack crackers. But one cracker stands alone as the only brand fancy enough to meet my exacting demands: I will never be satisfied by anything less than the upper-crust sophistication of a Ritz. Ah, Ritz—the very name itself conjures up images of handmade satin tuxedos, gowns of the finest gossamer, and grand ballrooms. White-gloved, top-hatted gentlemen strutting down baronial staircases while twirling canes. Impeccably dressed orchestras with matching outfits performing Jazz Age ballads. Champagnes chilling in gleaming silver ice buckets. White-jacketed Negroes issuing forth from kitchens bearing silver serving trays heaped with the finest crackers ever manufactured by human means. Ritz is simply the fanciest cracker known to man. When my chef prepares something sublime for my well-heeled guests to eat before dinner, he needn't search any further for a gourmet recipe than the back of the cardboard Ritz box itself. A panopoly of gustatory delights awaits! Smoked salmon, atop a Ritz? Sheer delight. Feta cheese and red peppers? Just like on the luxury cruise liners of the Aegean sea. Duck? Pheasant? No other cracker would dare offer such mouthwatering dining options, because no other cracker comes close to the refined elegance of a single, salty, buttery, crumbly Ritz.  I could not imagine consuming a lesser cracker.  A saltine, my good sir? Dare offer me a  ?! Pray tell, what grave offense have I committed to deserve such a crass display of effrontery? Do I look like a member of the lower born? Do you take me for an illiterate gutter-dweller, wallowing in my own filth in the street? A urine-soaked, pus-riddled common animal, licking its open sores and eating its own feces, sir?  I would rather be that than be made to consume such gruel as a saltine. Now take the repellent offal away and return posthaste with a cracker more suited to my standing as one to the manor-born: that rarefied and distinguished snack item known throughout the upper echelons of Continental high society as the one and only Ritz. One can almost hear the cries of ""Waiter! Another bottle of this magnificent crémant d'Alsace! And while you're at it—another plastic tube full of these divine Ritz-brand snack crackers, with my compliments to the chef!"" Sometimes, I indulge myself so far as to acquire several thousand dollars worth of caviar, truffles, Kobe beef, and endangered larks' tongues and scoop it all into my gullet with an entire box of Ritz crackers in a bacchanalia worthy of the pagan Caesars. In fact, one cannot help but wonder why Ritz crackers come to us in a paper-and-wax package, shelved near—and sometimes even touching—such lesser crackers as Triscuits, Wheat Thins, and other vulgarities of the common supermarket. They ought to be hand-delivered by coachmen in powdered wigs and livery, in a gold-inlaid chest encrusted with precious gems.  Ritz crackers are, and always will be, a luxury of unparalleled refinement, equal in elegance to such finery as Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup—the crème de la crème of mushroom soups!—or that standard-bearer of fine cuisine the French call ""casserole du tuna."" Not even the velvety smoothness of the finest Velveeta cheese product is its equal. Vive la Ritz!

"NEW CASTLE, PA—Shaken and needing companionship in this time of national crisis, Jordan Rosling, 26, announced Monday that he has decided to postpone breaking up with longtime girlfriend Allison Ward until the current bioterrorism scare is over.
 ""I've been thinking of calling it off with Allison for a while, but the time just never seemed right,"" Rosling said. ""Now that we might experience another Black Plague, this   isn't the time. I don't want to die alone, pathetic and girlfriendless.""
 Rosling said it simply makes more sense to wait until the Al-Qaeda terrorist network is completely dismantled before ending things with Ward.
 ""It's been almost six months since I started feeling like Allison and I weren't a forever thing,"" Rosling said. ""So what's a few months more? If we capture [Osama] bin Laden, and it's clear that nothing worse than these anthrax letters is going to happen, then I can make some of these life decisions. But as for right now, I have serious fears about how long my life will even last.""
 Despite his urge to end the relationship, Rosling said things are ""okay"" with Ward.
 ""Why rock the boat?"" Rosling asked. ""We're at war. I don't want to be watching CNN, freaking out all by myself the next time something major happens. I've been with Allison for four years, and we've had some good times. It would be just plain stupid to break it off now.""
 Rosling, who recently read  , said the recent anthrax attacks are ""nothing compared with the shit that could happen.""
 ""If smallpox is unleashed on the U.S., there'd be millions of deaths,"" Rosling said. ""They stopped immunizing kids for it in 1972, and immunity to smallpox diminishes with time, anyway. If a terrorist successfully spreads smallpox here, one in three people could die. And those odds are too scary to face all on my own.""
 Also contributing to Rosling's reluctance to break up with Ward is the fact that he has few other people to turn to besides her.
 ""Pretty much all of my good friends have spouses or significant others of their own. So if something happened, they'd be with them, not me,"" Rosling said. ""I don't want to die as a third wheel, all covered in weeping sores and rasping out my last breath as some couple wished I would give them some privacy.""
 While his primary fear is bioterrorism, Rosling said he is also nervous about the possibility of a chemical-weapons attack or nuclear strike against America.
 ""Can you imagine sitting there all by yourself, knowing you're going to die from radiation sickness?"" Rosling said. ""Then there's the added worry of our current recession. What if it turns into something on the level of the Great Depression? That would definitely not be the time to be on the singles scene.""
 Rosling insisted that his decision to put off the breakup is not a selfish one.
 ""Even though I've realized we're just too different for things to work long-term, I really do care deeply about Allison and wish only the best for her,"" Rosling said. ""If she's going to die, I want to be there for her, too. I would feel so guilty if I dumped her in her final days.""
 Though he termed the scenario a ""long shot,"" Rosling said he sometimes fears that Ward will break up with him and find a new boyfriend right before a major bio-attack.
 ""Then the new guy would be with Allison for a whirlwind one-month romance before dying together,"" Rosling said. ""She would be passionately falling in love in a time of doom, living every moment as if it's their last. It might even be that Mark guy she works with. I don't think I could handle that.""
 Rosling said things might be different if there were ""women knocking down [his] door,"" but that is not—and has never been—the case.
 ""I've never exactly been the ultimate ladies' man,"" Rosling said. ""So let's say I break up with Allison, and in three months, the whole world ends. I might not be able to find anyone to have sex with for the rest of my life. That would suck so bad.""
 There are other practical considerations, as well.
 ""If I break up with Allison, I'd probably move to L.A., where I have this good friend who can give me a job,"" Rosling said. ""But the last place you want to be if there's a smallpox outbreak or a nuclear attack is a major city. No, I'd better stay right here in New Castle with Allison.""
 Dr. Sheila Durkin, therapist and author of the bestselling crisis-management guide  , said Rosling's behavior is not surprising.
 In times of imminent danger, our self-preservation instinct takes over, and we seek out personal bonds that bolster our feelings of security and comfort,"" Durkin said. ""Given the circumstances, it's only natural that Jordan would behave like a spineless, self-centered prick."" ",1,Breakup Put Off Until Bioterrorism Scare Is Over

"GRESHAM, OR—In a breakthrough that has electrified the world's 10-and-under scientific community, Mrs. Wagner's third-grade class successfully vaporized water under controlled classroom conditions Monday.
 ""Um, the coolest thing was when we got to light the fire that made the water disappear,"" said Jake Squirek, 9, a member of the Gresham Elementary School experimental-research team. ""Then it boiled, then it turned into steam, which is the gas form of water.""
 ""Clouds are like steam, only not hot,"" said fellow scientist Pam McKee, 8. ""Water is called H20 in science.""
 The experiment began with researcher Brittany Chase, 8, transferring approximately 50cL of water from the hallway drinking fountain into an Erlenmeyer flask. The water was then poured into a test tube placed on a stand over a Bunsen burner.
 Despite offers from numerous members of the third-grade team, the burner was lit by Mrs. Wagner. Within two minutes, the contents of the flask began to boil, and shortly thereafter, the water vaporized and turned to steam.
 According to Mrs. Wagner, the experiment was designed to illustrate the principles of evaporation and the three states of matter.
 ""The students had already conducted an experiment in which an ice cube was placed in a dish and melted over the course of two hours, demonstrating the change from solid to liquid,"" Mrs. Wagner said. ""They did so well with that, I wanted to reward them with something more challenging.""
 Monday's successful vaporization brought to an end a string of failures and setbacks for the young scientists. In September, an attempt to get a hamster to run through a maze to reach a plate of honey-roasted peanuts was scrapped when the animal escaped and disappeared under the classroom radiator. Two weeks later, a demonstration of the sense of taste was abandoned when a roll of Life Savers that had been part of the exercise was inadvertently eaten. And last Wednesday, Mrs. Wagner said, a static-electricity experiment resulted in ""a lot of popped balloons and hurt feelings.""
 Amanda Reynolds, 8, was among those who feared that the vaporization would meet a similar fate.
 ""We didn't think anything would happen this time,"" Reynolds said. ""We didn't have any luck before, so we figured this time would be the same. But then it started to steam, and we were all excited. I didn't know what to expect. Then I got scared that it would explode and we would all get killed.""
 ""That didn't happen,"" Reynolds added.
 The breakthrough experiment has generated considerable excitement among third-grade scientists across the U.S.
 ""Do you know what this means?"" Monroe, MI, third-grader Shawn Bendix said. ""If we can vaporize water, we probably can vaporize other liquids, too. You just have to heat it! You just have to heat it!""
 Bendix then ran off to try to vaporize a quart of Strawberry Quik.
 Members of the grown-up science community had high praise for the Gresham Elementary School team, as well.
 ""These bright youngsters are the future of science,"" said John Diekman, Ph.D., chairman of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA. ""They will be the ones dissecting frogs, growing bean plants in milk cartons, and dipping litmus paper into acids and bases well into this century.""

"THE HEAVENS—Growing increasingly annoyed at their clear ignorance of basic social cues, God, Our Heavenly Father, was reportedly irritated Thursday that His guests did not understand it was far past time for them to leave Heaven. “For fuck’s sake, I didn’t say they could stay forever—some of them have been here for centuries now,” said the frustrated Almighty, who had long since ceased any attempts to entertain the guests and had instead begun to loudly do household chores throughout Heaven’s blissful expanses, a hint that was completely lost on the millions of souls who remained casually reclined on their respective clouds or catching up with their deceased loved ones. “I’m always happy to let people crash for a few nights, but enough is enough. I have shit I need to get done. Plus, they’re eating me out of house and home. I’ve tried every trick in the book to get them to split. I even told them I was taking a trip outside the universe for a while, but they were still here when I got back. I turned off the harp music a long time ago—it’s like, come on, party’s over.” At press time, the fed-up Heavenly Father had finally worked up the courage to casually ask Mother Teresa about her plans for the rest of the day.  ",1,God Irritated Guests Do Not Understand It Time To Leave Heaven
"WAVERLY, VA—Saying the inmates had best listen up and listen good because he wasn’t about to repeat himself, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rattled his baton along a line of prison bars in Sussex 1 State Prison Wednesday as he gave a speech vowing to crack down on violent crime. “I am your new Attorney General, and it is my sworn duty to put an end to the savage lawlessness in this country, so here’s how it’s gonna be,” said Sessions, who slowly paced the walkway of Cell Block C, rhythmically slapping his truncheon into his open palm. “What’s been tried has failed, so from now on, we do it my way. We’re gonna have ourselves longer, harsher sentences, and make no mistake, I do not just mean for adults. You had all best get ready, ’cause you’re gonna have some company in those cells real soon, and they’ll be staying for a mighty, mighty long time.” At press time, an inmate who had interjected that overall violent crime rates were at historic lows was thrown into solitary confinement “from now until Judgment Day” for talking back.

"This past January, one of my New Year's resolutions was to quit procrastinating so darn much. As for living up to the resolution, well, let's just say I procrastinated on  , too! But with the year winding down, I'm finally getting around to some things I've been meaning to do for ages, including a longtime dream project of mine. And just what is this dream project, you ask? (No, it's not sampling every brand of chocolate on Earth… honest!) It's none other than writing my very own special book: excerpts from the diary ""kept"" by my kitty, Priscilla Teasdale!
 Pardon my modesty, but isn't that just about the best idea in the whole world? I first thought of it seven years ago, when I spotted a marked-down copy of   at B. Dalton. Do you remember President Bush Sr.'s spaniel, Millie? Well, First Lady Barbara Bush wrote this story about Millie's life at the White House, pretending that she was Millie, and that the dog was intelligent and could write! Well, it struck me that I was a pet owner, too, and if Barbara Bush could write as her dog, why couldn't I write as my kitty? (After all, kitties, like doggies, are people, too!)
 The more I thought about it, the more excited I became. I truly believed this idea could fly. I'd been looking for another writing outlet besides my newspaper column, and this seemed so perfect! (Or should I say ""purr-fect""?) Plus, people just love anything that has to do with kitties or doggies! It seemed a shoo-in for the bestseller list!
 Trouble was, back in 1994, I had two cats, not one. Which would be the book's protagonist, Priscilla or Arthur? I'd always felt Prissy had a richer emotional life, but Arthur had more interesting adventures. (Of course, being an indoor cat, his adventures were pretty much limited to chasing glints of sunlight on the rug and getting a new water dish!) Unable to choose between my two pretties, I let the project gather dust.
 A couple of years ago, my quandary about which cat to choose seemed to resolve itself when Arthur died. (As you hardcore Jeanketeers may recall, he tragically choked to death on a Pincers The Lobster Teenie Beanie Baby.) At first, I decided to make Arthur my protagonist to honor his memory. But after several tries, I just couldn't bring myself to write about him. True, it would have been a nice tribute, but it was all too sad. And trying to write about Priscilla, just because she was the only cat left, made me even sadder. (I'd better end this paragraph pronto before I start bawling!)
 Anyway, after dropping the idea for a few more years, I finally came back to it a few weeks ago. Enough time had passed since Arthur's death, and I finally felt ready to write about Priscilla. (A little over a year ago, I acquired a sweet kitty named Garfield, but since Prissy and I had been pals for years, she seemed the more natural choice for my project.) I was nervous that the book would be difficult, but you know what? Not only has it been fun to write, it has practically poured out of me! It's like this thing practically writes itself!
 So I thought I'd give you Jeanketeers an exclusive advance peek at  . I've got about 10 pages done, but because my space is limited, I'm including just a small snippet. I've never written a book before, and I'm sort of flying by the seat of my pants here, writing down anything and everything that enters my head. So it's kind of rough and unstructured. But I think the lack of consistency is more than made up for by the abundance of heart. And to me, that's more important. Nevertheless, I'd   feedback from my readers. Let me know if I'm going in the right direction. Be completely honest… I can take it! (I have thick skin. You have to in the newspaper business!) Oh, and if you know of any publishers who might be interested, let me know!
 Well, here goes!
    Do I have exciting news! I found a loving home with the Teasdale family! My new mommy is named Jean, and my daddy's name is hubby Rick! I first met Jean when she showed up at the Gerson County Humane Society to adopt a little kitten. At first, I thought Jean was going to bring home every kitty there. (What a softie!) But when she saw my pretty tortoise-shell fur and green eyes, she knew I was the one!
 My home is great! There's every kind of Tender Vittles here, and all the tap water I can drink. My litter box even has a roof over it! There's just one problem: When hubby Rick came home and saw me, he got really mad! He started yelling at Mommy, saying how dare she bring home a kitten when she knows he's allergic to kitties. Well, I heard Mommy say he was just exaggerating the whole allergy thing, but Daddy was still very angry and told Mommy to take me back to the Humane Society, because ""there wasn't no way he'd live with some sissy cat!"" Then, something really scary happened: He grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and tossed me in an old beer crate! Mommy started bawling and practically got down on her knees and begged Daddy to let her keep me, saying she wanted a kitty so bad, and that she promised that she'd do everything, and that he wouldn't even have to so much as pet me. So Daddy said Mommy could keep me for a month, but if it didn't work out, I'd have to go back.
 I sure was glad to get out of that crate—it smelled like stale beer! And I really hope I can stay at the Teasdales. (Even if Daddy is a great big grouch!)
    It's my very first Christmas! Of course, Mommy Jean had to explain that Christmas is Jesus' birthday. (Just in case you were wondering, I believe in Jesus… 'cuz I'm a Cat-holic!)
 Anyway, I got a lot of great presents! I now have a carpet-upholstered scratching post, complete with a perch so I can look out our bedroom window in comfort. And I got soooo dizzy playing with my new catnip mouse on a string! Best of all was the big can of Bumble Bee tuna Mommy Jean got me. I got to eat it all as a special Christmas treat! (Unfortunately, it made my stomach all jumpy, and I threw it up later that night. Boy, was Daddy Rick mad when he stepped in my partially dried vomit with his bare feet in the morning!)
    Mommy Jean is just the greatest! Today, she got me a nice, warm, fuzzy sheepskin bed to sleep in! I showed her a lot of extra love today; I rubbed against her legs and purred like crazy. Mommy Jean may not have fur and a tail, but there's no one in the world I love more! It's too bad Daddy Rick won't give her human babies to raise. She has so much love to give, yet I fear so much of it will remain trapped forever in her heart.
 It's true that I don't have children, either, but that's because I had a little operation when I was still a baby kitty. Mommy Jean never had an operation. She's as fertile as a river delta! Her doctor said so, even though he says she should lose a lot of weight before getting pregnant. I sure hope that one day I'll have a little human brother or sister to play with! I'll even let them yank my tail!
 You know, as I re-read this, I'm thinking that some of it may be a little unrealistic. Kitties, wonderful and wise as they are, might not have such a developed vocabulary and keen insight. Well, it's only a first draft. (Boy, writing fiction is harder than I thought!) ",1,A Purr-fect Tale!
"HEAVEN—Condemning the heretical rejection of His divine will by a blasphemously underweight mankind, God declared Himself furious toward every person not actively striving to become as fat as possible off the divine bounty He has provided for His people upon the Earth. “This is the land of milk and honey, and also of fine meats, cheeses, fruits and nuts, breadstuffs, wines, and all manner of good things that I have set upon the Earth, all given freely to you, so chow down,” said the Creator, ruler and sustainer of all the Earth, noting that the human body was indeed a temple, and that a temple should be built as large as possible. “I had always intended for the weight of all sons and daughters of Isaac and Ishmael to be seven talents [approximately 500 pounds]; yet in their thousands and tens of thousands, many seek to eat as little as possible, and of that paucity, no carbohydrates. It is a blasphemy.” God further cautioned that, if humanity did not begin fattening themselves like sacrificial calves, He would be forced to make a chosen people of the Americans.

"For as long as I can remember, our Second Amendment right to own firearms has been under attack. Opponents say having guns creates added dangers, that they hurt more than they help. But what these liberal do-gooders never seem to care about are the innocent families taken hostage and murdered inside their very own homes. Or the women who are attacked while walking back to their cars late at night. Or even the men, in their early 60s, for whom life was going just fine until one day their wife decided that she wanted a divorce.  As Americans, it's our moral duty to protect our loved ones from the scum and filth of this world. And, by God, if those loved ones leave us because we drink too much or refuse to go to couples therapy, then we should also be able to feel the cold steel of a .45 caliber pistol between our trembling lips.  Our founding fathers realized this when they drew up the Constitution. They recognized the right for every man to bear arms against his aggressor. And, if that aggressor was not so much a physical entity as a devastating feeling of loneliness, the right of every man to cash in his chips and call it quits. People in this great country of ours should never have to live in fear—or live at all, once all hope of happiness has passed them by, and the thought of unloading a round into his worthless skull seems strangely comforting. To the Hillary Clintons and Rosie O'Donnells of this world, I only have one thing to say: If you want to take our guns away from us, then you're going to have to pry them from  our cold, dead hands. Most likely in our basements, near the woodpile. Or in the bathroom. We refuse to let some left-wing numbnut in Washington, someone who has never had his truck jacked or spent an entire morning guzzling whiskey and staring at old photos of himself back when  the future seemed bright, decide what's best for us. This is America, people, not France or some other godforsaken country where weapon ownership is limited or banned, and citizens are routinely denied the right to the quick, painless death that only a semi-automatic can bring. You’ll have to excuse me for not wanting to take any chances with my own life. For choosing not to have to depend on my local police department, or an entire bottle of sleeping pills, to bail me out of a tough situation. I just happen to believe that sometimes the only person you can really rely on is yourself. And when the time comes to make a life or death decision, it's comforting to know that you can always pull the trigger on that long barreled rifle with your toe. So go ahead and call me a ""right-wing extremist,"" a ""radical gun nut,"" a ""man who used to routinely forget his daughter's birthday, and who now, alone in the home he once shared with his family, spends every waking moment thinking about leaving a bloodstain the size of Kansas across his bedroom wall."" But before you do, ask yourselves this: Would you want to be without a gun if some crazy, drug-fueled maniac broke into your home late at night? Of course not. Now, what if nobody broke into your home, or even thought to enter it, even if they still had the keys and could come in at any time just to check in on you and make sure you were okay, because they were never coming back and didn't even want to speak to you again until you had ""resolved some deep issues""—would you want to be without a gun then?

"WASHINGTON—Saying that things are only going to keep getting worse unless it’s willing to step up and make some changes, millions of frustrated Americans wondered this week why the nation’s struggling mental health system couldn’t just snap out of its funk and pull itself together. Citing reports that an estimated 91 million Americans live in areas where shortages of mental health professionals make getting treatment difficult and that the mental health system had lost $4.35 billion in state funding from 2009–2012, exasperated citizens from across the country said they had finally reached their limit with the network of medical professionals, inpatient facilities, and long-term treatment programs that apparently lacked the willpower to improve its situation. “Look, I know it’s been a rough couple of years and things haven’t exactly gotten any easier lately, but this can’t go on,” said Oakland, CA resident Marissa Thomas, adding she had lost all patience waiting for the mental health system to stop wallowing in its struggles and make a concerted effort to get its act together. “Eventually, it’s got to want to fix itself.” “No one’s going to waltz in one day, wave a magic wand, and make all these troubles disappear,” continued Thomas, who said she was “beyond exhausted” with the mental health system’s inability to accommodate the estimated 600,000 severely mentally ill individuals who annually end up homeless, in prisons, or dead from suicide. “It just keeps having the same issues over and over again and doesn’t do a thing about them. I’m pretty much numb to it at this point.” As the nation’s mental health care system continues to sink deeper and deeper into despair, even failing to perform basic tasks such as routine mental health evaluations and emergency counseling services, Americans have reportedly begun to wonder if it has any desire at all to take responsibility for its current state or if it will just continue to burden the people close to it. Many also expressed alarm at the struggling system’s potential to cause harm not only to itself but others as well. “I honestly don’t feel comfortable being around it anymore,” said Raleigh, NC resident Patrick Leets, noting that the nation’s network of behavior health services only makes things worse by comparing itself to free and universally accessible systems like the United Kingdom’s. “It’s just so unpredictable. Until it finally recognizes what’s best for it and puts in some actual initiative to get back on its feet, I’m keeping my distance.” “I mean, Christ, look at the education system—it’s been in terrible shape for years, but it’s doing what it can to make the best of a difficult situation,” he added. Sources confirmed that many citizens have found supporting the troubled mental health system a hopeless exercise, saying that it simply needs to decide whether it wants to get well or waste away. “To be honest, it’s getting to a point where I feel like I just need to wash my hands clean of the situation,” said Anna Kivolowitz of Salem, OR. “I relied on the mental health care system for years, but now I realize I just can’t do it anymore. If it doesn’t want to take care of itself, there’s no way it’ll be there for me.” “But it’s out of my control,” she added. “I’m done dealing with it. I’m just done.” At press time, Americans said they were sorry and that they hadn’t meant to come off so harshly because they knew their mental health system didn’t want to be a problem, all the while reportedly resigning themselves to the fact that this was probably as healthy as the system was ever going to be.

"NEW YORK—As part of a preview of the network’s fall slate of shows, CBS revealed Monday that season 12 of the long-running sitcom   will explore why Sheldon Cooper keeps his job after sexually harassing six research assistants. “The story arc, which spans the entire season, shows that while there might be some credibility to the accusations, he’s far too important for the university to fire him now,” said Thom Sherman, the network’s senior executive vice president of programming, explaining that the September 24 season premiere, “The Accusation Attenuation,” featured six graduate students and several corroborating witnesses reporting Cooper for sexual harassment during his tenure as a theoretical physicist, the university’s investigation into the matter, and its ultimate dismissal of the charges. “As the season progresses, the incredibly thoughtful and cautious deans take the allegations extremely seriously before concluding, in the end, that all the women were likely lying. Not only are many of the accusations several years old, which obviously calls into question their timing, but also several of them are from opportunistic researchers who are plainly after Sheldon’s job. Viewers will surely enjoy a poignant yet hilarious scene in episode six, ‘The Uncertainty Principle,’ where Sheldon has trouble communicating the right threats to a physicist candidate whose career he’s planning to ruin. And the rest of the cast gets involved, of course, with Amy standing by her husband and attempting to discredit the accusers, while Howard, Leonard, and Raj eventually join the effort and convince two of the research assistants to recant their reports after repeatedly posting their personal information online. In the end, there’s just not enough evidence to take down someone as important in his field as Sheldon.” CBS also announced that the upcoming second season of  ’s spinoff show,  , would explore how Sheldon Cooper became frustrated with women early on as the girls who attend his high school repeatedly refuse to have sex with him.

"ITHACA, NY—A new study conducted by the Cornell Institute for Behavioral and Social Sciences has found what researchers believe to be a demonstrable link between being struck with a banana cream pie and a sudden, significant drop in one’s public standing. “What we have observed is nothing short of astounding,” Dr. Philip Shaw, a human sciences professor at Cornell and the study’s lead researcher, said Monday. “By having cream-topped pies forcibly applied to their faces—or kissers—men and women of high regard were seen to immediately fall in both status and esteem.”  “Whether the subjects were wealthy shopkeepers, pompous barons of British descent, or matronly women sporting tiny opera glasses—our results were always the same,” Shaw added.  The study, which was conducted with the help of 25 dignified members of the aristocracy and three rather clumsy butlers, showed a direct correlation between unexpected contact with the custard-based stimulus and a loss of social stature—including the respect of bystanders, the affections of untold gentlewomen, and any possibility of securing a sizable donation for one’s struggling playhouse. Even more surprisingly, results showed that the drop in standing took place in mere seconds and not over the course of many weeks, as is generally needed for adjusting an individual’s hierarchical status. “Upon each pie’s delivery, we were able to detect a 12 percent decline in both privilege and hubris,” said Shaw, who conducted further experiments on the airborne dessert phenomenon in a highly controlled masquerade-ball setting. “However, much to our surprise, a host of secondary factors—such as the angular velocity at which the pies were thrown, the length of time they stuck to a participant’s face before sliding off, and whether they were accompanied by the honking of a loud bicycle horn—also affected the overall reputation of our subjects.” According to Shaw, the location of the strike proved the most crucial variable, with the deposit of a cream pie to the crotch producing a 35 percent drop in entitlement on average. Timing was also cited as being pivotal by Shaw, who said that the sequence of introducing a pie into the face of an elderly countess, giving her time to clear the cream from the eyes and mouth, and then administering a second pie into her face generated the sharpest descent in stature.  “Response to the delivery of the pies was generally varied among participants, although we did observe nearly 15 separate threats of ‘Why, I oughtta…’ and roughly six distinct cries of ‘Well, I never!’” Shaw said. A 12-minute black-and-white video recording released by the researchers documented some of the more acute reactions to face-first pie contact, including the rapid emission of compressed steam from a participant’s ears† and, on three separate occasions, a fast-motion but ultimately unsuccessful chase around an elegant dinner table between participant and researcher. Isolated incidents of a cream pie causing one’s dickey to fly up into one’s face were also reported. Though the long-term effects of Shaw’s pie experiment are still unclear, a number of the subjects registered a strong psychological reaction within moments of completing the study. “Why, I cannot remember the last time I was so insulted in all my life,” said socialite Thomas DuBottomer, who on day four of the study ducked an oncoming cream pie only to have it land square in the face of a passing police officer. “I demand an apology, you troublemaking so-and-so!” Shaw’s report is not the first of its kind. Four years ago, a Princeton study attempted to measure the effects of discharged seltzer water on one’s reputation; and in 2005, scientists determined that slipping on a discarded fruit skin, rolling down a circular flight of stairs, and landing face-first into an awaiting cart of horse manure could be definitively linked to being fired from a board of bank trustees. Though the report has yet to be published in any major journals, Shaw has defended his team’s research. “I strongly believe our study to be of the utmost importance,” Shaw announced at a conference of behavioral scientists in Chicago on Tuesday. “Whether others approve or disapprove of it is not my concern. We are serving a greater purpose here, a higher purpose. What we have accomp—” The outspoken Shaw was thereupon struck with a banana cream pie, his opinions at once rendered completely irrelevant.

"Is there anything that compares to the majesty of the fall TV season?
 In late October, when the last of the repeats fade into darkness, it's time to pour a cup of hot tea, pull a favorite blanket up over your knees, and sit back and watch the network programming change. What a welcome relief it is after all those oppressively hot months of sizzling summer blockbusters!
 Sure, the summer movie season, with its exciting trips to the multiplex and dramatic box-office showdowns, has its charms. But by the time the fall season rolls around, I'm good and ready for a break from all that. Fall is when the colors of my Sony 36-inch TV really come alive.
 There's so much beauty to behold during the fall TV season: the deep brown of Jessica Alba's hair, the vibrant red and amber hues of Kelsey Grammer's sweater vests, the rustling of Calista Flockhart's skirts. Every year, there are those moments that are absolutely breathtaking, those special times you wait for: the familiar lilting strains of Peter Boyle's voice on  , the gradual unveiling of a new subplot on  , the crisp, cool air emanating from  's Anthony Edwards.
 Everything is so magical in the fall, you hardly know where to turn your eyes. Should it be to ABC's  ? Or to   on NBC in the same time slot? There are scarcely enough hours in primetime to enjoy it all!
 Fall is also the time to reap the benefits of all the seeds planted so carefully in the spring. This year, we found out who the father of Rachel's baby is on   and that Buffy is no longer dead. After months of anticipation, it was worth the wait.
 Speaking of waiting, there's less of it during the fall than at any other time of year. Happily, with the days getting shorter, the prime-time lineup comes earlier and earlier each day. You get home from work, turn on the TV, and, before you know it, the   syndicated rerun is over, and primetime programming has fallen upon the land.
 While much of the joy of the fall season is seeing the TV seasonal cycle completed with the return of all your favorite shows, fall also affords the opportunity to experience the wonder of the new. Shows like The WB's  , NBC's  , CBS's   and ABC's   were all welcomed into the world this fall. There's nothing quite like that first taste of the fresh faces the fall has to offer.
 For some, the fall is synonymous with hunting season. These adventurous types love searching through , never knowing what exciting made-for-TV movie or miniseries will jump out at them next. Meanwhile, for the little ones, the fall season holds no shortage of excitement, either. What child doesn't look forward to all that Halloween fun, from the   special to the   Halloween spectacular, not to mention all the fun commercials for candy and costumes?
 And, lest you think things peak in October, the fall season gets even better come late November. That's the time of year when, after some shows have flown south, and the dead series have fallen from the line-up, a peaceful calm falls over TV land. There's no longer any movement of shows from time slot to time slot. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better time for TV-star-gazing than a clear, static-less November night. Looking up from my couch to see the bright faces of  's Debra Messing and 's Craig T. Nelson, well, it almost chokes me up.

"THE HEAVENS—Saying that the incident had a profound effect on Him and that He hasn’t been the same since, God, Our Lord and Heavenly Father, recalled Thursday his life-changing encounter with an 8-year-old boy who had a near-death experience. “I was standing there one day in the brightness of Eternal Life when suddenly, a small boy came walking towards My light,” said the Almighty, explaining that He felt at peace and had no fear, as was nearly always the case, but that He could also see the boy’s small frame on an operating table far below and realized that He was seeing an actual out-of-body experience. “He asked me if I was God and this Heaven, and when I said, ‘Yes, my child,’ a look of total tranquility came over him. I tell you, it was really humbling. Before I could say anything else, the child’s spirit was returned to his body, but the feeling of total serenity still lingered. It made me really appreciate the afterlife, you know?” God added that He took great comfort in knowing that He will see the boy again very soon.

"MILWAUKEE—Describing his mind as both “a blessing and a curse,” local man Benjamin Walker, 27, told reporters Thursday that his intellect was probably just too intimidating for most women to engage with romantically. “I’m a very, very smart guy, and I guess most women are pretty scared off by that, you know?” said Walker, confirming that women often seem extremely uncomfortable and agitated around him, most likely because of how cultured and well-read he is. “After I’ve been speaking to a girl for just a few minutes, she’ll usually start to get this look in her eyes like she wants to bolt and I can just tell that she’s feeling so intellectually inferior that it’s impossible for her to continue with the conversation.” “Which is understandable,” Walker added. “I am able to speak confidently and at length about a wide range of subjects, so it’s probably hard for most women to follow along.” According to the Milwaukee resident, whenever he is talking to a young woman and begins to expound at length on one of the many topics he is well versed in—such as Malcolm Gladwell’s book   or the British graffiti artist Banksy—she begins to appear highly overwhelmed by his mental capacity and quickly grows visibly restless and distant. Walker, who acknowledged that his imposing cleverness and quick wit likely caused women to feel insecure about not being as smart as he is, confirmed that females frequently displayed an averse reaction to his impressive mind by noticeably “checking out” of the conversation or attempting, no doubt in fear and awe, to exit the discussion as quickly as possible. The 27-year-old, who graduated from Syracuse University in 2007, told reporters that he subscribes to   magazine and keeps up with the news on a daily basis—all facts that Walker said seem to persistently leave the opposite sex speechless when he inserts them into conversation. “I should really be more careful, I suppose, because I can see that my intelligence can be a major hindrance to meeting women, most of whom are probably looking for a guy with a more ordinary or slowed-down intellect—you know, someone more on their level,” said Walker. “Sometimes, after talking to a girl at a party, for instance, I will try to approach her again and she’ll purposefully avoid eye contact with me, just so she doesn’t have to deal with the embarrassment of contending with my staggering mental faculties.” “It’s tough, because I really try my best to relieve their anxiety and say, ‘Hey, look, don’t sweat it, I’m used to people not being able to keep up with my mind,’” added Walker. “But that never seems to help. They’re too petrified by that point.” Admitting that his remarkable mind can make him appear unapproachable, Walker told reporters that he has even taken to downplaying his formidable intellect during first dates in order to put women at ease, employing tactics such as talking slower or briefly pausing to allow his conversational partners time to process the information that he imparts at a breakneck pace. Ultimately, however, Walker said there was only so much he could do to lower his cognitive standards to another’s level. “Recently, for example, I talked to this girl at a bar for half an hour about Radiohead—quoting lyrics and telling her about how the band went in a new musical direction with [their 2000 album]  —you know, really making it easy for her to understand,” Walker said. “Things were going great, and I was saying a lot of very interesting stuff, but when I tried to call her a few days later, she never picked up or returned my calls.” “And it’s like, look, I’m a sophisticated guy, I like sophisticated music,” Walker added. “If you can’t get that, then there’s nothing I can do for you.” Walker confessed that at the past few parties he has attended, his profound sagacity pushed women toward less intellectually arresting men. “Unfortunately I sometimes puzzle women with my lofty comments and thought-provoking remarks, and that drives them right into the arms of complete dopes because that’s less scary for them,” said Walker. “You know, the kind of guys who can barely string together 10 words before resorting to asking a girl about her hobbies or what she does for a living. It’s like, what’s the point? Is that even a conversation?” “And this is why I’ve never really been in a long-term relationship before, because the girls I’m with tend to get frustrated with their inability to think on my level,” the 27-year-old continued. “In the end, I think the problem is that they want to be with me because of my exceptional wit, but they eventually realize that I’m just too deep.” ",1,Area Man’s Intelligence Probably Just Too Intimidating For Most Women

"NEW YORK—A study published Thursday by the McKinsey Global Institute confirmed that American citizens lead the world in the ability to justify needless purchases, a finding that extended across all consumer categories, from electronics, to food items, to motor vehicles. “When it comes to rationalizing a third flatscreen television, defending the bulk purchase of sale items, inventing reasons to upgrade a cable package, and categorizing any purchase as an ‘investment,’ we discovered that consumers in the U.S. are more than five times as proficient as their counterparts in other countries,” said researcher Peter Cahill, citing the roughly $100 billion per year that Americans justify spending on cell phones that are less than a year newer than their existing model, shoes with pockets for each toe, brand-name allergy medicine, in-home soda machines, apps, coconut water, collector’s edition DVDs, and thousands of other goods and services. “What’s perhaps more impressive is that the unnecessary spending gap between the U.S. and the next closest nation more than doubles when we factor in completely superfluous big-ticket purchases, such as tuition at exclusive colleges or 3,400-square-foot homes.” The study also found that U.S. consumers were equally dominant when it came to helping friends and family members justify the purchase of unnecessary products.

"SEATTLE—Appearing initially in the far corner of the living room and then several minutes later on the threshold between the kitchen and the hallway, local roommate Kelsey Stahl was, by multiple accounts, seen skulking around the edge of a house party Friday like a Victorian ghost child. According to sources, the unspeaking, expressionless 26-year-old was never witnessed exiting her bedroom, instead seeming to materialize out of thin air on the outskirts of a conversation circle as if she were the apparition of an English nobleman’s daughter who died of typhoid in 1868 and possibly went by the name Gwendolyn or Abigail. Several unsettled witnesses reported how, at one point, Stahl was seen standing rigid and silent a dozen feet beyond the dining area table that had been set up as the bar, looking out at all the revelers with a blankness in her eyes that suggested she had become trapped between this world and that of her girlhood in a mid-19th-century countryside manor. Wearing a skirt and top that may as well have been a calf-length, puff-sleeve dress with a lace collar and a large silk waist bow, the host’s roommate reportedly entered the kitchenette at one point for a glass of water and, just a moment later, appeared standing behind the couch like a spectral figure who perished suddenly at the age of 9 and has ever since drifted across the face of the earth unimpeded by walls or other physical surfaces. According to reports, roughly an hour into the festivities, several partygoers felt a sudden chill of cold air and looked around to find Stahl nowhere in sight, leaving them to wonder if she had ever even been there in the first place.

"WASHINGTON—Noting that the level of mental strain associated with the profession was far and away the highest recorded, a federal study on workplace conditions and occupational stress released Thursday has confirmed that your job is the most demanding career in the entire nation, and that none of your friends or family fully understand how hard it is. “Following a thorough review of every occupation cataloged by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that your job and yours alone exceeds all others as the most professionally strenuous and personally taxing choice of career, which creates levels of stress far beyond the comprehension of any friend or family member,” said Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, who noted that while your career may share certain similarities with those of siblings, roommates, or acquaintances, none of their complaints about fatigue or anxiety remotely measure up to yours given the extreme complexity and difficulty of your particular profession. “According to measures of effort exerted, skills required, tightness of deadlines, and importance of responsibilities, it is clear that your specific position and job title come with the most professional challenges in the nation. Though people close to you may try to sympathize, data shows that no amount of explanation or reasoning will allow them to recognize how profoundly grueling your day-to-day work truly is.” Perez added that those who encourage you not to check your work email on nights or weekends are simple-minded individuals with easy, mentally undemanding occupations who are fundamentally incapable of ever fathoming how important and consequential the tasks of your job are.

"I’ve been struggling with some pretty big questions lately about life and the meaning of existence. And to be honest, these days I’m finding it hard to believe what I was taught as a child, namely that there’s an all-knowing God who’s always watching over us and listening to our prayers. As much as I’d like to accept that an intelligent, loving presence is up there, I keep wrestling with doubts, and there’s one in particular I just can’t get past: If there truly is an omnipotent being who created the universe and wants us to live by His word, then why doesn’t He just throw us a really sick fucking party? Seriously, if the Lord gave us just one kickass rager that went all night, that’s all it would take for me to believe. Some will argue that’s not how God operates. “He works through the people in our lives,” they’ll say. Or, more frustratingly: “God’s ways are not for us to understand.” But those answers don’t satisfy me anymore. If God is real, wouldn’t He want us to know it? Wouldn’t He want us all to acknowledge His presence and worship Him? Well, if He’d just throw us one epic party with a couple kegs and everything, the question could be settled once and for all. We’d know that He exists, and everyone would believe in Him without a shred of doubt. In the Bible, it seems like the Lord cares so much about us honoring Him and obeying Him; in fact, He’s supposedly so concerned about that stuff that He wrote His rules down as the Ten Commandments. So why doesn’t He just lay it all out on the table and open our eyes right here and now with an unforgettable, balls-to-the-wall blowout that’s so insane people will be talking about it for years to come? I know that people will argue that believing in God isn’t about proof—it’s about having faith. But if God flooded the earth and delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, then He’s certainly not opposed to intervening in human affairs. Which just begs the question of why He hasn’t taken us all up to a sweet lake house, filled up a few coolers with brews, and just let everyone get shitfaced. After all, wouldn’t God want us to appreciate Him and be happy by playing beer pong and quarters all night long? Don’t tell me a being who created the world in seven days can’t put on an epic house party—I’m talking one where everyone has a plastic cup in their hands, we’ve got two different kinds of Jell-O shots going, there are people hanging out on the deck, people shotgunning cans up on the roof, and maybe even some body shots going on. Why not? This is an entity that supposedly created light and formed every single feature of the universe, so as far as booze is concerned, you know the Lord Himself would probably roll up with a ton of the high-end stuff—Stoli, Crown Royal, 151, all the primo shit. Believe me, if the Lord completely stocked the bar with all that top-shelf liquor and a ton of mixers, I’d be in church every Sunday. But the bottom line is that God hasn’t thrown a wild, rowdy party or even a BYOB barbecue, and that’s troubling. And when you really think about the concept of God, a bunch of other difficult questions come to mind, like why He lets bad things happen to good people, or why there is so much suffering in the world. If He exists and is truly a benevolent, loving God who cares about mankind, then why aren’t we partying hard 24-7? God could make it happen. He could say, “Let there be Cuervo,” and it would just show up. He could send His only son out to get more beer, or maybe just have Him drop by and turn some water into wine. Shit, man, if God really is all-powerful, we could keep that party bumping around the clock! We could all head down into the basement, where there’d be a big-ass dance floor and a fucking mind-blowing DJ spinning, because a God who reigns supreme over heaven and earth could hire anyone He wanted as entertainment, living or dead. He could have a band playing in the backyard with Jim Morrison, Bob Marley—whoever He wants. What kind of a God   want to do that for His creations? It simply doesn’t add up. If God were really out there somewhere, He would have had at least one totally sweet rager or maybe even a whole block party by now. Maybe He did a long time ago, but there certainly haven’t been any killer fucking fiestas in my lifetime. All I’m asking for is one little bash from the Lord Almighty. It doesn’t even need to be a big, flashy deal or anything. It could just be a nice, laid-back get-together with some good tunes, good beer, and good people. God wouldn’t even have to show up if He didn’t want to, though it’d be fucking awesome if He did. But here’s the thing: Without any proof of His existence, how can people even be sure they’re worshipping the correct god at all, especially when there are so many religions out there? Who’s to say that Christianity is right and that there isn’t another deity who’s actually in charge of the universe and who could throw us an even crazier all-out kegger? Buddha seems like he’d be down, maybe for a huge-ass pool party with a couple grills going, some volleyball, and then a bonfire when it gets dark. Or I could start praying to one of those Hindu gods with all the arms. Those guys could carry like six 30-racks of beer, high-five you, and blaze up all at the same time. That would be fucking epic! I suppose I’m questioning this so much because, deep down, I desperately want to believe. Maybe God exists and maybe He doesn’t, but if He does, and He ever gets around to throwing a big party for the ages, I’d be the first one there with a case of MGD and my bubbler in hand. After all, if God created me in His image, then I know He’d want to party His balls off and get blitzed out of His mind.

"How are you this evening, ladies? My name's Officer Randy. I'm a hard-bodied beat cop and I'm looking for Elizabeth Bender, please. Ms. Bender? I understand you're getting married tomorrow, but tonight you're in big trouble, ma'am. You see, we've been receiving calls from neighbors that you ladies are getting a little too rowdy in here, so HQ sent me over to take care of you. And that's exactly what I'm about to do. Just as soon as we go over some of the local ordinances regarding noise levels. As you may or may not be aware, Middlesex County and the state of New Jersey prohibit any loud disturbance in a residential area between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekdays and from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m. on weekends. Not to mention, you're living in an apartment building, and I'm sure your landlord has his own similar set of rules regarding noise. So I'm going to have to ask you to restrict your voices to a more reasonable volume for the remainder of the evening. If you choose not to comply with these orders, Officer Apollo and I might just have to lock you up in our fuzzy handcuffs, frisk you, and take you all the way downtown. You may also be subject to fines of no more than $175. Ma'am, please put your money away—you can't pay the fine here. You have to go down to the main precinct. You can pay in all singles, but it's much easier just to write them a check. That way you'll have a copy for your records. Ma'am, please—I hope you're not attempting to place bills in the waistband of my regulation hot pants. Bribing an officer is a felony, even if you do it with your teeth. So I suggest you sit down, or else I'll have no choice but to take out my big, hard nightstick. And I would really prefer not to, because it's actually quite difficult to get it back into the holster. Now, Ms. Bender, before we continue, you're going to have to prove to me that you're the woman you say you are. And I am required to inform you that lying to a police officer is a serious crime, one for which I would be forced to punish you to the fullest extent of the law. So ma'am, I'm going to need to see some ID. A driver's license or some form of state-issued identification. Do you need to get your purse? I can wait. Hey, is that the song ""It's Raining Men""? I should warn you: Whenever this song comes on, I am legally bound to remove my shirt, lather my pecs in baby oil, and thrust my crotch along to the beat. In fact, right now I could tear off these breakaway pants, and gyrate my hips so you can witness the full glory of my bouncing package. If I didn't have all this paperwork to fill out. So please change the track and turn the stereo down so the heavy bass line doesn't wake the whole neighborhood. I appreciate it. The sooner that's done, the sooner I can get out of your hair, and you ladies can proceed with your party without some pesky police officer with a bronzed chest and a leopard-print G-string getting in your way. Miss? Please step down from the table, miss. How much have you ladies had to drink tonight? Alcohol can cloud your judgment and lower your inhibitions, you know. Maybe I should make the bride-to-be come over here and blow in my big Breathalyzer. Would you ladies like that? It's bulging in my pocket right now. Uh-oh! Which one of you naughty girls wants to reach in and pull it out? Thanks. Now, here's how it works: You blow into the front end for two to three seconds, and then your blood-alcohol content appears on this screen a few moments later. In your case, it reads .07, which is below the legal limit for operating motor vehicles, so you're off the hook. Ladies, please pass this around. So, once again, I ask you to discontinue the music for the remainder of the night, and put away those penis-shaped noisemakers until sometime after 9 a.m., so I don't have to make a trip out here again. I'll let you off with a warning this time, but in the future I ask that you respect your neighbors and limit all noise pursuant to the New Jersey State Noise Control Act of 1971. Now—who wants to see me take off my pants? ",1,"Seriously, Ladies, There Have Been Noise Complaints"

And if you’re nominated in any of the non-acting categories, it goes without saying that this especially applies to you.” Boone Isaacs later reportedly singled out actor Lucas Hedges, advising the   star not to “fucking try anything.” ",1,Oscars Officials Warn Only Famous Actors Permitted To Get Political In Acceptance Speech
"NEW YORK—As winter tightens its grip on the nation, hockey fans from coast to coast are breaking out their team sweaters for the first time in what seems like ages, eagerly anticipating attending their first professional hockey game since the NHL's lockout began quite some time ago. ""Oh, hockey's back? Well, I'm glad they finally got that whole thing resolved,"" said North Carolina resident Max Sherwood, adding that once the ponds of Raleigh freeze over, he would definitely consider going to a game. ""I remember I used to see it on TV now and then, but not for a while, come to think of it. It's nice they're going to have that again."" ""I hope we can beat the Russians again, at any rate,"" Sherwood added. To fans of the NHL, there is nothing that comes close to hockey, and no doubt its sudden disappearance from the world of competitive sports some time in the last few years came as a crushing disappointment to the hockey faithful. But with the new year upon us, those die-hard fans will soon be thrilled by the breathtaking exploits of luminaries such as Mark Messier, Mario Lemieux, Gordie Howe, Paul Coffey, Barry Melrose, the Quebec Nordiques, and Wayne ""The Great"" Gretzky. And, as always, the NHL hopes that newcomers to the sport might find it fills the void between the college bowl games and the NBA All-Star Game. ""I still can't believe they skate the entire time,"" said Phoenix resident Brent Quigley. ""I've never managed to actually see more than a couple games back when they used to show them, and I've never been to one, because it's a pretty long drive to Los Angeles. But it's colorful, what with the fights and all, right?"" Pittsburgh, a major hockey hotbed, is reportedly abuzz with hockey-mad fans, as the local Pittsburgh players are once again expected to make another run at the elusive championship. ""You do remember that we actually won one a while ago? I'm pretty sure we did,"" said outspoken superstar Jagr, who, before the lockout, many hockey insiders claimed was on pace to break an important league record or records. ""And yes, I think we are doing okay so far. It's early,"" added Jagr, apparently referring to his team's preseason record, after being asked if his team had a chance to win the Stanley Trophy. Though the league promises that rule changes made during the lockout will promote a faster, higher-scoring style of play that should attract Americans to the sport, the NHL may still have difficulty competing with other nationally televised athletic events that have traditionally earned a larger audience, such as professional football, college football, arena football, professional basketball, college basketball, women's professional basketball, NASCAR season highlight retrospectives, motocross, the And-1 Mix Tape Basketball Tour, NASCAR season previews,  , professional bass fishing, the upcoming pay-per-view Oscar de la Hoya fight, ESPN Classic, the Ultimate Fighting Championship and its accompanying reality show, amateur bass fishing, highlights of Staten Island Yankees workouts, and college hockey.   ""We certainly think Americans have forgiven us for the lockout by now, and will continue to attend our games,"" said NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who was also acting commissioner during the work stoppage that resulted in the cancellation of hockey's equivalent of the world series for the first time in 90 years.  ""It was certainly a difficult time for this league, but I think last season showed everyone we have what it takes to get our fans' hearts back,"" Bettman added, evidently speaking of the high standard of play preceding the strike. Although the NHL has yet to sign a broadcast package contract with a major television station, most networks say they are committed to giving out the more important hockey scores if time permits. ESPN, the last national network to feature a comprehensive schedule of NHL games, has said it will continue to report results of games during the popular   segment, and would consider showing any Game 7 of a championship series if the NHL could afford the airtime.

"SKOKIE, IL—Describing how the affection between the pair was apparent the moment he met them, Father Gregory McNeil is said to have delivered a whole little spiel Saturday about how truly in love local couple Colin Brayer and Allison Trudeau are despite him not knowing them for very long. “I’ve only had the pleasure of knowing the bride and groom for a short while, but in our time together it has become abundantly clear that they are meant for each other,” said the local Episcopalian priest, who has reportedly spent a cumulative total of 55 minutes in the couple’s company on three brief occasions, including the wedding ceremony itself at which he was officiating. “Just seeing how Allison and Colin look into one another’s eyes or the way they tenderly interacted with each other during yesterday’s rehearsal, there’s no question that they are prepared to embark upon this remarkable journey together. It’s easy to see that their bond is a special and lasting one.” According to reports, the pastor then said he could tell the couple was surrounded by loving friends and family members who would always be there to offer their support throughout the marriage despite not knowing a single thing about any one of them and having never before seen them until that very moment.

"HOLLYWOOD—Film critic Jeff Reese, who viewed an advanced screening of   at Arclight Cinemas last Friday, has reported that the newest installment in the  franchise is mainly composed of three extended montages. ""The first [montage] occurs nine minutes into the film, right after Rocky is offered a chance to fight the champion, as Rocky recalls everything in his life that brought him to this point. There are flashbacks of, among other things, him arguing with Mick in his dingy apartment, ice-skating with Adrian, holding Apollo Creed while he dies in his arms, and defeating the Russian, all while several of the series' trademark musical numbers including 'The Measure of a Man' and 'There's no Easy Way Out' play in the background,"" said Reese, noting that the montage sequences were extremely well-edited and comprehensive. ""Once we rejoin Stallone's character in the present, the film launches into a 25-minute training montage, set to an extended version of 'Eye of the Tiger' that eventually segues into 'Gonna Fly Now' as Rocky once again sprints up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Once we finally arrive at the momentous final bout, Bill Conti's 'Going the Distance' is played as the number of each brutal round fades in and out, suggesting that the match is more of a long battle of attrition. That sort of thing."" Reese added that the movie was ""pretty much what [he] expected."" ",1,New Rocky Film Just Three Montages

"The bones in its face just make it look so cool. It's huge, its knees are awesome, and of course, it has tail spikes. I would be totally remiss if I didn't mention the sweet tail spikes. But it's not my favorite. As anyone who's read this column knows, T-Rex is obviously my No. 1 dinosaur—that goes without saying. A common choice? Perhaps. But I defy anyone to legitimately deny the raw power of that perfect killing machine. And please, I don't want to hear anything about T-Rex being a scavenger, because I'll go to the mat on that.  However, I'm not talking about T-Rex today. I'm here to give Stegosaurus its proper due. This gentle, awesome giant is easily lost in the mainstream shuffle of Apatosaurus—No. 33—and Pachycephalosaurus—No. 12—and I don't condemn anyone who, albeit wrongly, puts Stegosaurus lower on his list. Plus, other pundits out there will pick the safe route, going on all day about Allosaurus and its thumb spikes—admittedly really cool—or Velociraptor and its claws or whatever. It's just that I'm not going to pad my favorites catalogue with a bunch of obvious carnivores.  Stegosaurus is definitely, solidly, my No. 2 favorite dinosaur of all time. No. 2, mind you, out of   dinosaurs. Ever. Even Ankylosaurus, though I imagine some of the so-called experts out there will find that pretty hard to believe. Ever since watching   at my fourth-favorite age of five—the original 1974 series, that is, which is the 17th-best television show of all time, easily—Stegosaurus has had a special place in my heart. Granted, that show introduced me to many wonderful dinosaurs: Pterodactyl was No. 2 for a time, Brontosaurus was in that slot for months, and even those reptoid midgets, the Sleestacks, with their big black eyes and pointy heads were ranked second for six episodes until they were disqualified due to a technicality. But Stegosaurus has an undeniable staying power—and awesome tail spikes, as I said—and eventually edged them all out.  Of course, it could never edge out T-Rex. Just look at its teeth! But I've already devoted my third- and fifth-favorite columns I've written about dinosaurs to Tyrannosaurus, so, again, there's no need to get into that. Nor will I dwell on dinosaurs three through 10, considering they're all different types of pterosaurs, and, for now at least, I don't have the space to break down the subtleties.  Anyway, Stegosaurus. Why No. 2, you ask? The obvious answer for this, of course, are the thermoregulatory plates on its back, but that's my distant third-favorite reason as to why Stegosaurus is my second-favorite dinosaur. No, my No. 1 reason is the ""second brain""—the coolest brain, by far, in the Stegosaurus—near the base of its tail used for controlling reflexes in the rear part of its body. Reasons two and four are a little complicated and both tail-spike-related, so I'll leave those for another time. Reason No. 5 for loving Stegosaurus is because it could regularly and easily knock down trees. Huge trees. Which is awesome. In many ways—well, eight ways, actually—Stegosaurus embodies a lot of things on my various lists that are pretty great but don't quite make the top. For example, the Clash's triple album,  —the second disc of which is the third-best disc—the 31st-best record of all time, between The Faces'   and Neil Diamond's   soundtrack. To me, Stegosaurus carries on its back, along with those wicked, massive plates, the weight of all the silver-medal winners in my life, including my second-favorite list and my favorite salty snack foods, which are the third-best variety of snack foods. It may seem a little excessive to a few self-styled experts (who are high on my blacklist—well, my blacklist for self-styled experts) to place so much secondary importance on an extinct herbivore. My answer to that is: No, it's not. However, I'm not so petty as to allow ranking to consume my entire existence. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ranking things, like Stegosaurus, comes in second, right behind drawing, and just ahead of my mom, who's currently at a solid No. 3. She's up from No. 5 after a stellar showing this past Christmas.

"WASHINGTON—President George W. Bush was unusually reflective in the final weeks of his administration, taking time during speeches and press conferences to look back on key decisions, expound on his legacy, and tout his role in paving the way for the nation's first African-American president by serving eight years as its first openly gay president. ""I'm inspired by our great country's willingness to look past the color of a man's skin—or, in my case, his overt homosexuality—and elect him based on his ability to lead,"" Bush told reporters following his meeting with president-elect Barack Obama on Nov. 10. ""I've always been proud of my homosexuality, and I am so proud of the United States."" Bush added, ""Thank you, America, for taking a chance on an openly gay man from Texas: tight jeans, cowboy hats, and all."" Recalling how he worried during his first campaign that voters were not ready to put a gay man in the White House, Bush said he was ""shocked and overjoyed"" to win in 2000, and could not have done it without homosexual adviser Karl Rove, his strong base of closeted gay ultra-conservative supporters on the Christian right, and his ""best friend"" Laura. ""While I tried to be commander in chief first and a homosexual man second, I knew that everything I did would be judged through the lens of 'America's first gay president,'"" Bush said during an interview with ABC's Charles Gibson broadcast Dec. 1. ""Looking back, my personal need to prove my manhood definitely influenced my actions. The arrogant swagger, invading Iraq, my ruthless support of the death penalty—heck, even setting back gay rights 25 years—all of it seems so silly now."" Former press secretary Ari Fleischer agreed, saying that Bush carefully cultivated his image as a masculine, simple-minded, heterosexual male in order to combat his insecurities about appearing weak before the international community. ""Believe me, sister, he overcompensated with a capital 'compensated,'"" Fleischer said. ""But when the cameras stopped rolling and the podium was put away, he was just fabulous. We had a fabulous, fabulous time."" While many will argue for generations about Bush's political impact, all seem to agree that his presidency at last proved to a once-disenfranchised group that anything is possible. ""I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime,"" said David Nevin, a 58-year-old homosexual living in New York. ""And I probably won't again because he was a terrible fucking president who ruined it for all of us."" Added Nevin, ""What a bitch.""

"MIAMI—As devastating as their 29-17 Super Bowl XLI loss to the Colts was for the proud Chicago Bears, it was worse for their coach: Lovie Smith will forever be remembered as the first African-American coach to lose a Super Bowl. ""I give full credit to the Colts,"" Smith said, exhibiting admirable class and dignity by speaking to reporters moments after the game ended, despite the heartbreak he certainly felt at failing on football's biggest stage during the first Sunday of Black History Month. ""We were outplayed and outperformed today, but I'm proud of my team. I just hope they are still proud of me."" Smith became the first black coach to lead his team to the Super Bowl less than three weeks ago when his Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints mere hours before the Colts advanced past the Patriots. His story was covered to exhaustion by the media, who made endless comparisons of Smith and Doug Williams, the first black quarterback to play in a Super Bowl. However, some say the comparisons break down when considering that in his Super Bowl, Williams, unlike Smith, won. ""Let's not forget that this is still a great moment for any coach,"" said Dan Marino, who covered the game for CBS. ""No, Lovie Smith didn't call a perfect game. No, it wasn't his day. Should he have done some things differently? Of course. But at the end of the day, I hope we can see this as something more than a huge disappointment for the black community."" ""I just hope this doesn't become a focus for negativity,"" said CBS' Shannon Sharpe. ""Responsible people, truly knowledgeable people, will be looking at all the positive achievements black coaches made this year—Smith's among them. I know that certain people will say that it just isn't time yet for a black coach to win the Super Bowl. And even though Smith lost, I think those people are just wrong."" With Smith's dubious place in history now assured, prominent figures around the league worry that his ignominious loss will only add to the stereotypes surrounding black coaches. ""Will this feed the stereotypes about African-Americans? Probably,"" said Minnesota Vikings head coach Brad Childress, who says he has ""enormous respect"" for Smith's coaching ability and work ethic. ""There will be those who look at the Super Bowl and say the same old crap they've been saying forever—'See? Black coaches can't coach in the rain. Black-coached teams turn the ball over too much. Black coaches' quarterbacks are overrated panicky idiots who throw the ball downfield without even looking and get picked off.' Bunch of crap, of course. But after Sunday's game, it's going to be that much harder for him to shake that off."" ""I'm sorry, but Lovie Smith let us all down,"" said Tony Dungy, the first African-American head coach to win a Super Bowl. ""I'm sorry, I love the guy—you know Lovie used to work for me—but he was totally outcoached out there. He looked lost—the other team had him spinning his wheels, looking helpless, unable to cover his weaknesses. It infuriates me that America had to see a black man so totally outmaneuvered in the biggest game of the season."" ""Face it, Lovie got beat bad,"" Dungy added. ""America really needed an African-American coach to win that game. And thanks to Lovie Smith, we got to see an African-American lose.""

"WASHINGTON—In preparation for the traditional task of welcoming his successor to the Oval Office, outgoing president George W. Bush canceled all his appointments and press conferences Monday so he could spend the day outfitting his desk with a series of traps, gags, and hair-trigger switches. ""Oh, man, is he gonna get it,"" the president said after rearranging the letters on his computer keyboard and supergluing the direct-line-to-the-Pentagon telephone to its base. ""If the 44th president is anything like me, he'll grab this can of peanuts to snack on when he's talking to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and when he does—bam! Right in his face!"" As one of his last official acts in office, Bush reportedly rigged the presidential drawers, chair, and ceiling fan with a number of inconveniencing though harmless devices, including Vaseline-covered pens, fishing-line trip wires, a saltshaker with the top unscrewed, a fake set of nuclear launch codes, an inflated whoopee cushion, and a drawerful of pickles. After backing slowly away from his desk, the president informed his top aides that, if he can get back from the inauguration quickly enough, he also plans to place a bag of canine excrement near the Rose Garden door and set it aflame. ""The commander in chief has successfully executed this mission with precision and decisiveness,"" said White House press secretary Dana Perino, speaking to reporters with large black circles around her eyes. ""Unfortunately, he is not able to return to his desk for the remainder of his term due to all the thumb tacks, but he will continue to lead the nation from the Roosevelt Room."" Taking his place in a long history of executive office shenanigans that began with President Martin Van Buren's famous sneezing-in-Jackson's-coffee prank of 1837, Bush carefully drafted his personal letter to the next president on White House stationery, filled the envelope with glitter, and then used rubber cement to secure the letter to the bottom of his desk's right-hand drawer.

"CAMP DAVID, MD—The Federal Aviation Administration said engine failure was to blame for a pilot losing control of a four-seater Cessna aircraft that crashed head-on into President Bush Thursday.

""From Monday, February 19, to Sunday, February 25, I invite the American people to join Laura and me in remembering those who made a difference in remembering those who made a difference in the rich history of this great land of ours,"" read Bush's statement. ""People like Cleveland Mayor Michael White, who recited Martin Luther King, Jr's famous 'I Have A Dream' speech during Black History Month in 2004; event planner Sheila Carter, whose passion and determination forever changed the face of commemorating civil rights in America; and, of course, the Father of Black History Month, Gerald Ford, who first signed [Black History Month] into law.""  ""Without the achievements and sacrifices of these brave folks, it's hard to imagine where African Americans would be today—especially during February,"" the statement continued. ""We must never, ever take Black History Month for granted."" All four major television networks are planning to preempt Black History Month programming with airing Black History Month History Week specials every weeknight. The networks have scheduled more than two dozen 30-second profiles of various Black History Month pioneers, including Annette Van Stijn, a former CBS News producer who created the first Black History Month network interstitial spots in 1980, and William Thorndike III, the first man to register the domain name ""BlackHistoryMonth.com.""

President Bush and the First Lady are scheduled to hold a Black History Month History Week reception, to be hosted by Greg Gumbel, in the White House East Room on Feb. 23. The gala event will honor a number of guests including Portland, OR fifth-grade teacher Jo Bishop, who has what is considered to be the largest collection of Black History Month stamps, Carl Johnson, the first black director of a Black History Month TV special, and Hallmark illustrator Mark Spencer, who created over 250 Black History Month–themed greeting-card designs.  The reception will also include a meal prepared by New Orleans chef Emeril Lagasse and a blues performance by Eric Clapton. The evening will conclude with the unveiling of a new commemorative coin commemorating the first-ever Black History Month commemorative coin, and a keynote address by Sidney Poitier biographer James Shimkus. Black History Month History Week has not gone without controversy, however. Some southern school districts are refusing to acknowledge it, and some black activists have criticized the lack of minorities being honored. ""Where's the fanfare for those tireless African-American booking agents representing the Reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, whose dedication and perseverance ensured that this country would have to listen to two of Black History Month's most important spokespeople?"" Nation Of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan said. ""Black History Month history is made all throughout February, not just in one week of it.""  ""It's no surprise that the white man chose the last week of the shortest month to honor Black History Month,"" Farrakhan continued. Former president Bill Clinton took a break from Black History Month celebrations at Harlem's famed Apollo Theater to praise the move, but called on Bush to designate the last Wednesday of every February as Black History Month History Week History Day.  ""While this certainly is long overdue, we must not forget those leaders and elected officials of our past who set the stage for the creation of Black History Month History Week,"" Clinton said. ""Only then will the contributions of these amazing Americans truly be honored."" ",1,Nation To Celebrate First-Ever Black History Month History Week

"LAKE WOBEGON, MN—Though local residents insist it has been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, MN, their hometown out on the edge of the prairie, state police officials descended on the small community Tuesday when another 24 corpses surfaced along its placid waterfront. In the last year, the viciously mutilated bodies of 57 Lake Wobegon citizens have been found in the lake. Nine of those discovered were members of the town's floundering baseball team, the Whippets, whose severed throwing arms were never discovered. ""The Wobegon Killer typically stalks his victims in the dead of night, murders them, and discards their hacked-up bodies in the water,"" Minnesota State Police chief Ron Taggard said. ""We believe this same individual may also be responsible for the bombing of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Church in July; brutally maiming local waitress Darlene with a meat cleaver; and force-feeding lutefisk to the owner of Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery, Ralph, until his stomach burst."" Added Taggard, ""We're dealing with a madman here."" According to officials, the bodies were discovered when hundreds gathered to watch Mr. Berge's 1949 maroon Pontiac sink into the thawing lake as part of the annual Sons of Knute Ice Melt contest. As the car submerged, onlookers witnessed a number of purplish- looking corpses float to the surface, most of them decapitated. ""Last time I saw a crime this bad was a couple weeks ago at the Chatterbox [Café], when Dorothy ran out of rhubarb pie,"" lifelong Lake Wobegon resident Daryl Tollerud told reporters. ""Huh, the high school choir's gonna have some trouble getting its April concert together if that's Miss Falconer's† head bobbing up and down out there."" Other corpses that have been positively identified include former Lake Wobegon High School football coach Mr. Magendanz; 87-year-old Myrtle Krebsbach, whose husband joked that it was the only way we could get rid of her; and Bunsen Motors co-owner Clarence Bunsen, who, according to autopsy reports, had his throat slashed with an ice skate before being chained to a large stone head with grass in its ear and sunk to the bottom of the lake. While investigators are determined to find the murderer before he kills again, Lake Wobegon citizens have remained surprisingly calm.† ""What's the use in complaining?"" Irene Bunsen, Clarence's sister-in-law, told reporters. ""It's like the cold weather. Everyone has to deal with it, so it's better to just keep quiet. And besides, maybe Pastor Inqvist and his wife deserved to die after they went to Florida for that one week in January while the rest of us sat here and froze."" ""Pardon me, I have to check on my tomatoes,"" Bunsen added. ""Set the record in '78 with a 25-ouncer, and I'm not going to stop trying to beat it because of a few grisly murders."" Immediately after the gruesome dredging, locals gathered at the town's watering hole, the Sidetrack Tap, to speculate as to who could be responsible for the killing spree. A group of Lutherans claimed the killer is most definitely Catholic, as evidenced by the fact that they saw him drive away in a Chevrolet. The town's Catholics said the murderer must be Lutheran, because they saw him drive off in a Ford. ""I'll bet it was Clint Bunsen,"" bar regular Mr. Hoppe said after ordering a beer and a bump. ""He's still steamed he isn't chairman of the Fourth of July parade anymore, so he flew off the handle and started killing people. Even his own brother.† I'm tellin' ya, it's the truth."" ""I think it was the Tollefson boy, Johnny,"" an intoxicated Mr. Berge told reporters. ""Big New York man, moved out of here as fast as he could and always thought he was too good for us. His father was a great man, though. Best grain elevator operator this town has ever seen. Here's to Byron Tollefson!"" While most maintain that Lake Wobegon citizens are incapable of serious wrongdoing, law enforcement officials have uncovered new evidence indicating the killer could be a local. ""We do have one suspect: a Caucasian male in his mid to late 60s, who was last seen dressed in a dark suit, a red tie, red socks, and sneakers,"" Taggard said. ""This deranged psychopath talks in a very breathy, slow cadence, and was overheard several weeks ago saying, 'I have to finish what I started. It's gotten out of control. All of them must die.'""

"WICHITA FALLS, TX—Calling it an essential step toward securing the Texas border and protecting his people's way of life, Gov. Rick Perry announced Tuesday the completion of a 1,953-mile wall designed to keep out millions of unwanted Americans. According to Perry, the 75-foot-high barricade running along the northern boundary is the culmination of more than 160 years of escalating tensions between Texas and the United States. Though a protective barrier has been under consideration for decades, the Texas Legislature voted unanimously to begin construction on the project immediately following the 2008 presidential election. ""As governor, it is my responsibility to do whatever's necessary to maintain the territorial integrity of Texas,"" Perry told reporters during a press conference held inside a sniper tower overlooking Oklahoma. ""If you are a Texas citizen, you shouldn't have to worry about some American coming in here, using your goods and services, and taking away your job."" ""Let the record show I have nothing personal against Americans,"" Perry added. ""I just think they should stay in America, where they belong."" The wall is comprised of six security layers: a razor-wire fence equipped with motion sensors, surveillance cameras, and guard towers; a 70-foot-wide trench with expert marksmen stationed along its perimeter; a roadway patrolled by armed vehicles equipped with synchronized electromagnetic wave gradiometers to detect Americans attempting to tunnel their way into Texas; and a second, third, and fourth fence. The final section of the barricade, a reinforced concrete enclosure containing the city of Austin, will be finished by August 2009. ""These Americans are destroying the moral and social fabric of our state,"" said Rep. Chris Turner, who added that he worries when he looks around Texas and sees people from places like Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Vermont. ""The man who used to repair my truck was replaced by some mechanic who moved in here from Kansas. Lately I can't go to the store or the bank without running into all kinds of these foreigners. This wall is the only hope we have of keeping Texas safe."" ""The truth is, Americans are just different from us,"" Turner added. ""We don't even speak the same language."" According to Texas Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Tom Alford, Americans will only be permitted to cross the border if they have immediate family living in Texas, in which case they can apply for a 90-minute monitored visitation to be held inside a checkpoint detention facility. However, Alford stressed that any American attempting to transport barbecue sauce, beef jerky, belt buckles, or longhorn cattle back to the United States will face the death penalty. Thus far, a majority of Texas citizens support the border wall, with nearly 8 million signing up to join a coalition of Minutemen that will guard the fence. ""These good-for-nothing Americans want to come in here and wait in the same lines as me, watch the same movies, and eat at the same restaurants,"" El Paso resident and border patrol volunteer Larry Carlile told reporters. ""Who do they think they are? I'd never dare waltz into America and act like I owned the place. That country's a godforsaken hellhole, anyway."" ""Round 'em up and get 'em out,"" Carlile added. ""Go back to Seattle or whatever you call it."" Since the wall's completion, there has been no official comment from Washington. However, sources close to President Obama said that upon being informed of Gov. Perry's announcement the commander in chief muttered, ""Thank God.""

"Dear Wise Old Navajo Man Who Could Really Go For A Hamburger Right Now, My husband and I take lots of vacations together. It keeps our marriage lively and helps expand our horizons, as a couple. This year, unfortunately, money is extremely tight and we just can't justify an extravagant trip. Any tips for making the most out of a close-to-home adventure? In darkness under the world First Man was made, and First Man was cold and lonely. First Man, who was wise and powerful, took up his treasure of White Shell, and he placed it in the East and breathed upon it, and up came a cloud of white smoke; and to the West he set Abalone, and breathed on it, and from it rose a cloud as black as nightfall. The colors of these rose up and became the Sky, and circled one another, and became the Night and the Day, and First Man rested in the Sky, and had a hambur—and slept. It's a tale as old as time: My neighbor built his fence on my property. I go away one weekend, come back, and I've lost 6 good inches of my backyard! What authorities can I turn to when my beautiful azaleas pop up on his side of the fence this spring? Then First Man took his last treasure, the Red-Yellow Stone, and placed it in the middle, and breathed upon it; and from it came a pillar that contained in itself all things, like those really good hamburgers you get at In-N-Out or Five Guys. And this was the Pillar of the World, and up the Pillar did First Man lead the People, drawn by a hunger, a deep, growling hunger for something juicy and delicious…or possibly for what they knew not. In every step did the People gain a little, for being newly made, all was new to them, and gathering knowledge, and feeling, and French fries, and a soda, and, ooh, maybe some onion rings for the ride back to the reserv—I mean, the Coyote followed them. Or have I not gotten to that yet? I just started playing   for PlayStation and I'm already stuck. I beat the first two games no problem, but I've spent four whole afternoons wandering around the wastelands in this one, and I still haven't located the Family. How do you access their headquarters? Do I have to wait for nightfall? Now following behind the People was Coyote, Born-in-the-Water Scrawny Wanderer, who was there when First Man made the Sky and the World, but disdained it as something not his own, and Coyote mocked the Sky and the World, as one may say a hamburger must be dry and overcooked when one cannot have that hamburger. And yet he followed the People up the Pillar of the World, as Coyote must always have witnesses for his anger and foolishness, as a lazy man who eats only microwave-reheated White Castle Slyders seeks the pity of those who have fetched hot burgers from Wendy's. And now, waiting before the People, were many great evils, Fire God and Spider Ant, the Hamburgler, and Salt Man, and Cousin-of-the-Raven. And First Man fought with them, and though he thought he should perhaps not, he took their songs of power into himself, the way one may seek to take the recipe for a hamburger not one's own, one which calls for a cold pat of butter to be placed at the center of a third-pound beef patty, so that when broiled, the butter infuses the meat, making it delectable and juicy, but also unhealthy, especially if you put bacon on it with cheese and mayonnaise. And this is what First Man did—not the recipe part, but what I mean is he became seduced by something not entirely healthy. And there was a new Wendy's right off Exit 22 that was not too far from First Man. Help! I've gotten myself into a DIY pickle. Some time ago, I bought a couple pieces of nice artwork and decided to make my own frames. Great way to save money and time, right? Wrong! I can't seem to get my miter joints exactly flush at all four sides. Any suggestions for making a picture-perfect frame? And so the people saw that First Man was evil with the delicious, flame-broiled patty, onion, tomat—with the  , excuse me—stolen from those who were themselves evil. And Coyote spoke to them in secret, saying, First Man will undo you; he has brought you into the world to consume you, as though you were no more than those miniature hamburgers you can get in bars these days. You know, the ones you can just keep eating without getting full, because what you really wanted was, you know, a  . A thick, juicy burger or maybe two, piled high with toppings and maybe some of that good brown mustard, and—ooh—Swiss cheese. Man, does that sound good right about now. I wonder how late that Red Robin on Shaffer Road stays open on Wednesd…uh, sorry, where was I? Um, and in the fullness of time all became as First Man, and his knowledge passed throughout the People, as did his evil and his knowledge thereof, and two bacon double-cheesburgers with lettuce, pickles, tomato, ketchup, and mayo on toasted sesame-seed buns cooked medium rare. The end. ",1,Ask A Wise Old Navajo Man Who Could Really Go For A Hamburger Right Now
"GREAT BROOK FARM STATE PARK, MA—In a surprising development that has confirmed a number of longstanding local rumors, authorities discovered the 32nd Regiment of His Majesty's Royal British Army still fighting the Revolutionary War in a small wooded area outside of Carlisle, MA Monday. The disoriented foot soldiers—who in the spring of 1776 survived a barrage of Patriot cannon fire at Dorchester Heights only to become lost during the subsequent British retreat—were found by park rangers marching in the direction of a nearby Price Chopper supermarket. ""Keep ye muskets at the ready, men,"" Col. Edmund Thorpe of Leicestershire was heard shouting to his troops as they prepared to cross an empty stretch of Route 225, which Thorpe claimed was a primary gunpowder supply route. ""There is danger in this valley, for the traitorous coward Washington and his militia are said to camp just beyond that ridge."" Area folklore and occasional reports from nearby RV parks have for years suggested the presence of a ragged, hardy band of British soldiers still remaining from the Revolutionary War. But what was once dismissed as legend has now been verified by Walter Carp of the Merrimac Valley  Historical Society, who identified the 32nd Regiment after watching its members struggle to scale a razor-wire fence near a local recycling center. ""That's them, all right—the old 32nd,"" Carp said. ""They fought valiantly at Breed's Hill, but they never seemed to have the right coordinates when it came time to track an enemy. Looks like they might be a little worse for wear, the poor fellows."" The regiment's last mention in historical records came in March 1776, when the soldiers garrisoned a small fort near the Concord River and awaited orders from Gen. William Howe, then commander in chief of British forces. Though regiment scout James Winthrop reportedly estimates that Howe is no more than 80 kilometers from their location, public records indicate the general has been in London since his burial there in 1814. ""Howe cannot be far,"" said Winthrop, pointing to a faded map sketched on worn hemp paper. ""No more than a fortnight away."" After receiving intelligence on the foreign military unit, the Pentagon immediately dispatched F-15s from the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, but the planes were called off after British foreign secretary David Miliband assured officials that the redcoats did not represent the United Kingdom. While the 32nd Regiment's numbers have dwindled over the past two centuries due to illness and desertion, the remaining holdouts have vowed to continue fighting until the colonists' siege of Boston is repelled. They then plan to rendezvous with the King's 14th Regiment at Fort Ticonderoga, near the current site of the Diamond Run Shopping Mall, to restock on hardtack and tobacco. ""'Tis been a long and bitter struggle with our foolhardy American cousins,"" 2nd Lt. Henry Bertram said during a brief pipe break near the soccer field of Washington Elementary School. ""Dearly do I miss my fair wife, Abigail, and our precious babe, Elizabeth, safe at home in Leicestershire. Why, my daughter must be tall as a barrel by now!"" Having survived the brutal winters of 1831, 1907, and 1999, most members of the regiment appear to believe that the worst stretch of the war is over, and that a full surrender of all colonial militias to the Royal Army is imminent. However, after spotting a number of new outposts last week in the growing Colonial Estates subdivision west of Boston, some have argued that the Americans may in fact be making gains. ""Fie on your childish speculations,"" said Col. Thorpe, responding to growing concerns in his ranks. ""I will not have this regiment torn asunder by such cowardly prattle. Somewhere in the Province of Massachusetts Bay there is a loyal countryman in whose farmhouse we can tarry for a night. Once rested, we shall strike a final blow to the treasonous Yankees."" Added Thorpe, ""By God, the jewel of the His Majesty's crown shan't be lost!"" The last reported sighting of the 32nd Regiment occurred in January, when a number of Carlisle locals claimed to have seen the redcoats loitering in or around their backyards. ""I saw some old guys in funny costumes messing around near my toolshed about a month ago,"" said Bay State Electronics Supply employee Jim Hicks, 45. ""But when I flicked on the porch lights they ran back into the woods."" Local law enforcement officials said the soldiers are now considered suspects in a string of unsolved garden burglaries that began in 1838, as well as in the 2003 deaths of five Revolutionary War reenactors near Lowell, MA. The Centers for Disease Control is investigating whether the regiment may also be responsible for the recent deaths of several thousand New England residents from smallpox.

"PUNTILLA LAKE, AK—After running directly into the grandstands during the Iditarod's ceremonial start and veering 55 miles off course late Tuesday to chase a marmot, Siberian husky and rookie sled dog Melvin apologized to his musher and fellow canines Wednesday for making a complete fool of himself in the early stages of the annual 1,150-mile race. ""First Iditarod jitters, I guess,"" the visibly contrite Melvin told reporters Wednesday at the Rainy Pass checkpoint. ""I feel like such a moron. Here I am in the last great race on earth and I'm blowing it. I mean, 100 times out of 100, when my musher yells, 'Gee,' I turn right. But yesterday I go left down an icy slope into a bunch of evergreens and nearly break everyone's neck."" ""I have to pull it together,"" added the dog, making a point of directly addressing his musher, two-time Iditarod champion Lance Mackey. ""I'm sorry, Lance. I'm acting like an idiot out there."" Melvin has gotten his squad into several embarrassing scrapes thus far, one of which occurred at Willow Lake when, in an effort to find a place to nap, he twirled around three times while still in full harness, fouling his lines and entangling his team in multiple snarls. In addition, as the team was on route to Skwentna, a child spectator threw an imaginary stick over the team, and Melvin chased it 300 miles back to the first checkpoint at Yentna Station. Melvin's most humiliating experience, sources said, was a 20-minute period during which Mackey repeatedly ordered him to mush and the husky merely stood motionless, staring at Finger Lake. ""You look around and you realize that you are going up against your idols—Larry, Bronte, Salem, Handsome, Blue—and then it hits you: This is the fucking Iditarod,"" Melvin said. ""It's not the Jack Pine 30 or the American Dog Derby. Out here, if you playfully root through your musher's sled basket and destroy his heavy parka and extra-warm sleeping bag, well, that's a mistake that could haunt you the rest of your career. Unfortunately, I'm learning that the hard way."" Melvin later admitted that he was overwhelmed by the pressure of participating in his first Iditarod and consequently had psyched himself out. Bouts of anxiety reportedly led to a stress dream Monday night in which he found himself standing on a calm, ice-covered pond for several tranquil minutes before the ice suddenly cracked beneath him. ""Instantly, I was treading in freezing water, and the more I struggled to get back on land, the faster I sank,"" Melvin said. As he dreamt, the husky unconsciously gnawed through his team's snub line. Consequently, two point dogs and one wheel dog are still missing, and the sled can no longer go around corners. Just five days into the race, the group is a projected seven days behind the rest of the pack. ""I'm too 'in my head' right now, you know? I have to remember my training from when I was a pup and just be natural,"" said the dog, adding that despite his most recent failures, he believes he was born for this. ""No more stopping in the middle of a run to find a private place to go to the bathroom. Why would I even do that? I know I'm running in the Iditarod, for crying out loud. And I'm certainly not going to sprint into my teammates ever again, because that means I'm destroying our neck and tug lines, and I'm going completely the wrong way."" ""I need to stay focused,"" Melvin continued. ""Also, I think I'm going to go chase that big moose over there."" Despite the husky's shortcomings, musher Lance Mackey has stated that Melvin will remain in the lead dog position, mainly because Melvin bit the leg of fellow lead dog Sarah. Melvin was quick to point out, however, that at the time of the incident, he was suffering a panic-related delusion in which Sarah had transformed into his father, an Alaskan malamute who always told his son he would never amount to anything. ""It's a saying amongst us mushers that the dogs never make mistakes,"" Mackey said. ""But it's not my fault that Melvin stops every 45 minutes to furiously dig in the snow. That dog's a wreck."" Mackey then sighed and added, ""This is a terrible Iditarod."" ",1,"Stumbling, Bumbling Sled Dog: 'Sorry, This Is My First Iditarod'"

"WASHINGTON, DC—The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that its Counter-Counterterrorism Unit successfully carried out its largest and most complex anti-anti-terror exercise to date, destroying the Washington Monument in a massive explosion that left 122 dead, dozens more injured, and the area around the National Mall a chaotic scene of smoke and debris. ""We learned from Sept. 11 that we can't just sit back and wait for the terrorists to attack us,"" said DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff at a press conference held in front of an on-site triage tent, gesturing to the blackened stump of the 122-year-old obelisk as divers pulled bodies from the nearby reflecting pool. ""We still have a lot of work to do, but this operation exceeded our expectations. If we hadn't destroyed the Washington Monument today, we would never have known how vulnerable it was to attack."" ""Now it can never be destroyed by terrorists,"" Chertoff added. While the counterterrorism unit assigned to protect Washington, D.C.'s landmarks was recognized for its ""loyal service,"" Chertoff said the counter-counterterrorism team deserved special praise for having had ""such a profound impact"" on the future of American security. The CCU was created in 2004 in response to the lack of terror activity since the Sept. 11 attacks. Its main tasks include raising awareness among the American public of the ""myriad unknown threats"" that still face the country, while also testing the readiness and effectiveness of the nation's counterterrorism program by exposing agents to real-world scenarios. Last winter, the eight-man Counter-Counterterrorism Unit was prevented from blowing up the Statue of Liberty and from releasing deadly sarin gas at a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game. But sources within DHS said they believed CCU's months of planning and reconnaissance paid off in the latest exercise. The CCU's after-action report showed that the team began the mission by convening outside the monument at 10:23 a.m., disguised as counterterrorism officers. Commanding officer Commanding Officer
Sgt. Campbell Payton, who is believed to be the leader of the group, then ordered sharpshooters stationed around the perimeter to begin eliminating security personnel, and sent a four-man team to choose hostages from the terrified tourists at the scene. After taking control of the area, Payton tested his counterterrorism adversaries by demanding the release of all Guantanamo Bay detainees. When U.S. hostage negotiators said they would ""see what they could do,"" they were shot dead by accompanying CCU agents for breaking a strict DHS policy against negotiating with terrorists. ""Events like those today prove just how real the threat is—how none of us is safe,"" said acting White House Press
Secretary Dana Perino during a briefing today. ""The White House is looking forward to many more exercises of this kindto ensure that we can fully protect high-value targets and keep this important work on the minds of the American public."" David C. Reynolds, a linguist in the DHS's terrorism prevention task force who has an office between the counterterrorism unit and the counter-counterterrorism group, said he was shaken by the loss of so many close associates. ""I'll miss having them around,"" Reynolds said. ""I'm mourning the friends who died combating and carrying out this momentous act, but at least I know their sacrifice was not in vain."" President Bush, who has already declared a state of emergency in the area, is scheduled to tour the wreckage tomorrow. In a statement released today, Bush urged Congress to pass a proposed $291 million spending package for the counter-counterterrorism program, while pointing out ""the clear need"" to provide the counterterrorism program with better training and equipment. ""By shattering the Washington Monument, the peace of our nation's capital, and dozens of people's lives, the dedicated counter- counterterrorists have proven just how devastating a determined enemy can be,"" the statement read in part. ""These brave men showed those who would seek to do us harm and those whose job it is to stop them that America is not to be trifled with."" Special officer Jeremy Stillwell, the only member of the counter-counterterrorism unit to survive the exercise, died early yesterday morning while being questioned by counter-counter-counterterrorism personnel.

"OSHKOSH, WI—Joyous tidings were trumpeted throughout the hamlets of central Wisconsin this week after 43-year-old Mattress King James Koepke III, Lord and Master of a vast bed and box-spring empire, selected Beth Lowery, a buxom, flaxen-haired maiden from the small village of Waukau, to be his bride. The 36-year-old queen-to-be, red of cheek and unmarred by pocks or the great widening of the hindquarters endemic to females of the region, reportedly accepted the king's matrimonial offer without hesitation. The new queen will reign alongside the noble bedroom furnishings monarch, and together they shall rule the mattress kingdom, which spreads across four convenient locations in the Fox River Valley. Following the royal proclamation, the Mattress King and his retinue reportedly celebrated with great relish amongst the citizenry at Tinker's Pub, where Wild Turkey and Miller High Life did freely flow until the early morning hours. ""I'm real happy for [King] Jimmy,"" said James' most trusted consul since high school, Sir Louis of Wilkinson. ""This new one seems like a great gal. All's I gotta say is, it's about time!"" James III—the territory's unchallenged sovereign of discount prices on Sealy, Serta, King Koil, and Tempur-Pedic mattresses since his father, James II, became too enfeebled to run the empire in 1999—has been in search of a suitable queen ever since his last bride, Linda, the Great Bitch of Pewaukee, absconded in the night with a lowborn scoundrel from whom she was taking skiing lessons. Though she was banished from James' sprawling split-level Oshkosh palace in 2002, the former queen was able to empty his vast coffers by half, leaving the Mattress King much embittered by romantic conquest for many years. Sources close to the king said that he remained most dubious about his prospects of ever again finding true love until he was instantly smitten by the fair and reasonably chaste Beth of Waukau, a common serving wench at a local Applebee's. In his great languishing for his beloved, the Mattress King reportedly could not rest his mighty head in slumber for nigh a fortnight, and supped at the simple chain tavern every day for a month, walking amongst his subjects as one of their own. At last, no longer able to contain his desire, His Highness summoned the courage to request that he be permitted to court her in the customary manner with an evening of bowling. Though he cared for her deeply, King James at first did hide his noble birthright from Lowery, afraid that his lady love was indeed one of a roving pack of money grubbing whores that had befallen the area. ""I think Jimmy didn't tell her who he was because he got burned so many times in the past,"" said Kyle Osterberg, trusted ward of the king's fiefdom in Appleton's Fox River Mall. ""He wanted Beth to love him for who he is as a person."" According to sources, the dirty-flaxen-haired Lowery finally discovered the king's true identity after seeing him in all his regal dress on a printed edict on the back of the Oshkosh   newspaper. In the full-color announcement, His Majesty declared himself insane due to the unheard-of discounts he was offering on all Simmons mattresses throughout his kingdom. Soon after, the Mattress King asked for her hand, paying a handsome tribute to her parents in the form of a 25-percent lifetime discount at any of the franchises under his purview. ""Jimmy is such a great guy, and so much better than the other jerks Beth was always dragging home,"" said Melinda Lowery, the future Mattress Queen's mother, clearly still in awe of her daughter's unimaginable providence. ""And [the queen's father] Clark [Lowery] and I just love our new mattress set."" Though the benefits of mattress royalty will be many, the new queen will not be without her sacred duties. From the day their union is formed, Lowery will be at her husband's side in the back office of the North Main Street location, where her most important charge will be balancing the royal checkbook, because, according to the king's decree, ""she's got a great head for numbers."" The Mattress King and his betrothed will reportedly be wed this May, with a lavish reception for the local peasantry to be held at the Delmar Party House. Sources said that no expense will be spared for the wedding feast, where local delicacies will abound, including innumerable hot wings from Purcell's Bar & Grille. The queen is expected to produce an heir to the throne in six and a half months. ",1,Mattress King Selects Wife From Small Wisconsin Village
"WASHINGTON—According to a new report released Monday by a panel of top economists and social scientists, the People's Republic of China will overtake the United States as the world's dominant asshole by the year 2020. The findings, published in the most recent issue of  , support recent speculation that America's unquestioned reign as the leading super-prick may soon be drawing to a close, leaving China as the foremost shithead among all developed nations. ""We are seeing a changing of the asshole guard,"" said Andrew Freireich, noted economist and lead author of the article. ""Although the U.S. will remain among the world's two or three biggest cocks through much of this century, we can now confidently project that China, with its soaring economic growth, ever-expanding cultural influence, and total disregard for basic human rights, will overtake America as King Prick Numero Uno within the next 10 years."" Added Freireich, ""It's the dawning of a new huge bastard era."" According to the report, China has slowly emerged as a massive fucker over the past half century, a period of egotistical growth unseen since America's booming douche years following World War II. Over that same time, China has seen a dramatic rise in both its GDP and Shithead Index, definite signs that the Asian nation is developing into a cocksucker of global proportions. ""When you consider China's wanton pollution, rising militarism, and rampant overdevelopment, it's clear they'll soon be thoroughly out-dicking the U.S. in every measurable area,"" international affairs specialist Neil Farren said. ""Not many Americans want to admit it, but as the yuan continues to get stronger, and millions upon millions are exploited as a result, more and more people worldwide will be looking to China, not America, and saying, 'Man, can you believe what an unbelievable sack of shit that country is?'"" China's ascension to supreme asshole status is occurring at a much faster pace than experts originally predicted. In fact, many now believe that by as early as 2015 Chinese citizens will arrogantly strut across the globe disrespecting other cultures and shouting loudly while dressed in XXL ""Speak Chinese or Go Home"" T-shirts. Prominent scholars claim that America's gradual fall from the upper echelon of international supershits is merely part of an inevitable pattern seen time and again throughout world history. ""All of the great asshole nations eventually watch their day in the sun slip away,"" historian Richard Merriam told reporters. ""Don't forget that Great Britain was the world's dominant asshole for well over three centuries, and look at it now: a pussy-whipped shell of the insufferable, bullying jackass it used to be."" Others have posited that China's ascension may be part of a larger reorganization of the global asshole hegemony that could see the United States losing even more ground in the century to come. ""A country like Iran is obviously a pretty big dick, but ultimately it lacks the resources to be a truly world-class asshole,"" Farran said. ""Same goes for Pakistan. But the list of abominable shit-heel countries competing for global prick dominance is a long one, and the U.S. is just going to have to get used to seeing countries like Russia and India mentioned in the same breath as itself."" ""Many Americans are going to be upset over the prospect of falling from that top spot, but that's the reality we face,"" Farrar continued. ""Hopefully, the United States will find a way to grow and adjust to its evolving role on the world stage without acting like a complete and utter fuckhead about it.""

"LANSING, MI—In another devastating blow to the state's already fragile economy, the Unemployment Insurance Agency of the state of Michigan permanently shuttered its nine branch offices Monday, leaving more than 8,500 unemployment employees unemployed. Announcing the closings at a press conference, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm called them ""a tragic coda"" to a once-vibrant industry that until this week defined the Michigan economy and served almost one-fifth of the state's employable population. ""This is a sad day for the people of Michigan,"" Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. ""Our state has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric."" Since its inception in 1937, Michigan's unemployment benefits system has been among the nation's most productive, outlasting the state's automotive and other industrial and manufacturing sectors to become Michigan's most enduring job-provider. For many, the closing of UIA marks an end of an era. Flint resident Martha Ayers recalled the ""glory days"" of the 1980s when the line of workers waiting to get inside each morning stretched around the block. ""People from all over the state used to come just to visit our unemployment office,"" Ayers, 52, said. ""Just like Detroit, Ypsilanti, Novi, and most other Michigan cities, Flint's an unemployment town. Has been as long as I can remember."" The sudden collapse of the very institution that formed the backbone of the state economy has left its former employees in total shock. Many newly laid-off UIA workers have expressed dismay at how the closures were handled. While most front-line workers were given no advance notice, department heads were presented with pink slips a week before the announcement and privately urged to return to the office while it was still possible to collect benefits. Fifty-one-year-old Paul Huegli worked for the unemployment office for 25 years, and now finds himself in the odd position of competing for work against the very individuals he once served. ""Helping people move on with their lives after they'd been suddenly fired is all I've ever been good at, all I've ever known,"" Huegli said. ""What am I going to do with myself now?"" Some of Huegli's colleagues are taking action. Former outreach associate Aaron Corcoran, 41, said he plans to join his brother-in-law and move to Kentucky. ""We heard there was a lot of unemployment down there,"" Corcoran said. ""I bet they can use someone who learned his trade in the heart of the unemployment industry. We were the best in the world."" Although the UIA closures appeared to come from out of the blue, some had predicted the agency's downfall, calling its spending-based business model unsustainable. ""They were pouring every penny of profit back into the product, and with all this money going out and none coming in, it was bound to catch up with them,"" said systems analyst Mark Sturdevant, who had spent the past three months observing the UIA offices firsthand since being fired from an untenured teaching position in the economics department of Michigan State University. ""No one, not even Michigan's state unemployment office, can elude market forces."" Despite seemingly grim prospects for the Michigan unemployment industry in the near future, Gov. Granholm expressed solidarity with the laid-off UIA workers, saying that she was ""confident"" the state will once again have a thriving unemployment industry. ""In fact, within a few years, I expect to be right out there with you guys,"" Granholm said. ",1,Thousands Lose Jobs As Michigan Unemployment Offices Close

""Until we deem that this whirling knife vortex fully complies with all state and federal safety regulations, we unfortunately have no choice but to shut it down,"" commission spokesman James Fenten said. Vortex operators are angry. ""Closing the vortex is costing dozens of workers their paychecks,"" project supervisor Carl Blaine said. ""It's costing the city $100,000 every day it's down.

"THE FRONTIER—After having bravely endured rising fuel costs, unemployment, and a massive drought in consumer confidence, all 300 million Americans announced Monday that they will soon begin the long journey westward, abandoning their stakes in the crumbling housing market to seek the golden future that surely lies past the horizon. Struggling to eke out a living for the past 20 decades, the U.S. populace has supported itself with odd jobs in the fur trade, tinkering, information technology, and pharmaceuticals industries, but has finally succumbed to the mounting pressures of modern life. The nation plans to strike out on its own come fall, when the weather's cooler, hoping to make its fortune and perhaps find a little patch of soil to call its own in the sprawling wilderness between O'Hare International Airport and the Great Pacific Ocean. ""There just ain't nothing left to do but pack what we can carry and head out West,"" said Arizona native Charles Kuhn, 42, who was recently laid off from his position at a fancy advertising agency. ""Out past the mighty Mississip' all a man needs is a strong back and a good horse. Heck, won't take but two weeks under them wide-open skies to build a house, plant some squash, and wrangle a little graphic design† work with full benefits, genuine growth potential, and two weeks' paid vacation. Now that thar's the life for me."" ""I hear there's a good steady creek and some open pasture just outside San Diego,"" added Kuhn, charging his cell phone one last time as he traced his finger along a crinkled, hand-drawn map bearing the ol' ""I-5 N"" trail he will follow to the California seaside town. ""My cousin went out there and he's doing real fine. Real fine. Says they got good jobs with annual cost-of-living adjustments just falling out of the hills out there."" Leaving behind the woes of their bustling cities, small mining towns, large auto-manufacturing towns, suburbs of auto-manufacturing towns, and the economically stagnant state of Nebraska, the pioneers will set out across the vast Western expanse with nothing but the promise of opportunity and a few old resumés. Although it remains unclear what they might find in that savage territory, some sources indicate the move may bring a significant boost in self-employment, prevent thousands of bankruptcies, and allow settlers an opportunity to learn agricultural techniques from the Mexican folk who sometimes wander over the border. Robert Wong, once an associate with Bear Stearns in New York, said the moribund securities industry has left him in such a financial mess that he has no choice but to take his wife and two pretty young daughters out West. The 52-year-old reportedly plans to ride out violent market fluctuations in the foothills of the Ochoco Mountains. ""Don't know what waits for me out there, but when you hear the dull roar of the Rockies, all the bank-foreclosure warnings and high-interest credit-card offers in the world can't keep a man indoors,"" Wong said. ""Yes, sir. I've just got to make my last car payment, cash out what's left of my 401(k), default on [daughter] Emily's student loans, and strip the house of copper wiring, and then it's 'Oregon or the Grave.'"" The federal government has not yet issued any plans for dealing with the mass exodus, which is expected to have wide-scale economic repercussions in the abandoned regions, including a complete collapse of consumer trading and a short burst in hardtack sales. However, the House of Representatives will begin debate on bipartisan measure H.R. 3492, which would declare a state of emergency on the East Coast and provide tax breaks to those who remain behind, as soon as Congress reconvenes next month at a cabin in Rock Springs, WY. ""Everywhere across this land, hard-working men and women have come to see that anyplace is better than here,"" said Rep. Roy Blunt (R-MO), who is giving up his $169,300-a-year job in search of work in the railroads. ""No matter how bad things get or how dark tomorrow may seem, the one thing Americans can always count on is the promise of a better life somewhere else."" At press time, the approximately 2 million square miles of land that make up the American West are experiencing the most severe rash of wildfires and earthquakes in recent history.

"NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—A team of three out-of-work stem cell biologists announced Monday that, after four weeks of rigorous observation and field testing, the evidence conclusively shows that chief researcher Dr. Henry Rogers' dog Franklin likes beer. ""We're extremely pleased with the results of the experiment,"" Rogers said. ""It exceeded our highest expectations, and we're confident that our findings will have far-reaching implications for the coming weekend."" According to the team's report, Rogers, along with colleagues Dr. Tom McCarthy and Dr. Simon Huang, formulated a hypothesis that Franklin, a purebred boxer, would drink beer poured into his water dish. After scouring through couch cushions to secure funding for an initial test, the first round of experiments began in late February. Franklin was administered a sampling of six economy-priced beer brands in 12-ounce increments at the rate of one unit every 1.5 hours over several successive Saturdays. His tail-wagging, equilibrium, speed of consumption, and general playfulness were monitored throughout for variations from baseline norms. While the scientists said the neutered 5-year-old subject showed no clear preference for any one brand, Franklin tended to lap up Presidente beer at the fastest rate, followed by Rolling Rock, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Milwaukee's Best, and lastly, Icehouse.   ""Due to our limited resources, we were only able to obtain cases of the most inexpensive test materials,"" Huang said.  The team recently managed to secure a New Jersey state research subsidy of $2.55 by returning the empties. McCarthy provided his Shar-Pei, Wrinkles, to serve as a control. Wrinkles was only given water to drink, though the team had to scrap one set of data due to confounding variables introduced when the control subject consumed 7.35 ounces of beer when the scientists' backs were turned. Despite this setback, Rogers said that the team's data revealed a consistent correlation between increased quantity of beer intake and erratic behavior, though the intensity seemed to decrease with each subsequent day of testing. By the end of the study, the 65-pound canine had built up a tolerance to alcohol that reportedly rivaled that of his human overseers. The test subject did, however, have a tendency to vomit if he chased a tennis ball or took a car ride too soon after a study trial. Franklin's interest in beer did not appear to be entirely taste-based. Over time, the subject's interest in non-alcoholic O'Douls declined as he learned to associate the brand's slightly flavorless taste with a lack of physiological effects. A peer review conducted by recently laid-off Rutgers University chemist Dr. Harold Wilson, a respected associate of the three scientists, supports their findings. ""After carefully scrutinizing the data and witnessing a replication of the experiment at Dr. Rogers' house, I am confident that these findings are solid,"" Wilson said. ""That dog loves beer."" Rogers and his team said they will continue their work in the burgeoning field of dog–beverage interaction. ""Our research raises tantalizing questions and opens the door to new areas of scientific inquiry,"" Rogers said. ""Does Franklin like mixed drinks? Cordials, such as Kahlúa? It's all very, very exciting."" In addition to the ongoing study, Rogers said that the researchers have outlined a future experiment to study the effects of   on Huang's cat, Schrödinger.

"Dear Guy Who Knows A Little Bit About Dealing With These Lawyer Types, Christmas is coming up, and once again, I'm at a total loss for what to get my dad. He's just so picky about the things he likes, yet he refuses to make a wish list like everyone else in the family. I don't want to get him the usual books and CDs, but every time I ask him what he wants, he claims he already has enough stuff. Any suggestions? Look, I've dealt with some of these lawyer types in the past, so I know how this is going to shake out. You just got to know how to handle them. That's all. Here's what they're going to try to do: They're going to try and snow you with a bunch of fancy legal hogwash, just to throw you off your game a little. Everything's going to be ""plaintiff"" this and ""settlement"" that, and around and around they'll go. But don't let that rattle you. You've got to sit up straight and keep your eyes open around these characters. They're just trying to take you for a little ride on the old ""money-go-round."" And trust me, admission isn't free. I just got offered a new job on the 22nd floor of a large office building. The only problem is, I'm deathly afraid of heights! I know it's dumb not to take a job simply because it's in a tall building, but at the same time I don't really want to work in a place that's going to make me a nervous wreck all day. Should I turn the job down? You've just got to force these Ivy League types to meet you halfway, understand? Otherwise you're giving them an open invitation to walk all over you. Trust me, I went through hell and back with Tammy's lawyers, so I've got a pretty good idea how this works. For instance, say you're sitting in one of these lawyers' offices, right? And they offer you a glass of water or a cup of coffee. What do you do? Do you accept it? No, you   accept it. See, if you accept it, you're putting   in the position of power. You don't want them to gain the upper hand, is the thing. Now. Say one of these lawyers offers to pick up the check at a nice restaurant. Do you let them? No, you   let them. Wait—I mean, yes! Yes, you   let them! Why should   have to pick up the check when you're the one paying $200 an hour? See what I'm saying? They're slippery, and you're going to have to think like a shark if you want to outfox them. And for the love of Christ, don't sign anything! Don't even hold a pen in your hand. That's Rule Numero Uno with these people. Once they got your John Hancock down on paper, they got you by the balls. And boy do these jokesters know how to slam you on the fine print. You sign one or two little divorce papers and next thing you know you're giving half your salary to a woman who hasn't worked a day in her life since college. Give me a goddamned break.  What's an appropriate amount of money to spend on Christmas gifts for my coworkers? This year's Secret Santa is set at $50, but I think that's too high. Should I say something to my boss, or am I being an Ebenezer Scrooge? Don't let 'em sweat you. Do not let these guys catch you asleep on the wing, or you can kiss your sweet keister goodbye. The only thing these bloodsuckers understand is eye contact and a good strong handshake. You let them know right off the bat that you're not some rube who's going to faint at the sight of their framed degrees and big lawyer chairs. Do everything I say and you might just make it out with your wallet intact. It seems no matter how hard I try, I just can't get my kids to eat healthy. They refuse the nutritious food I cook at home, and when they go over to their friends' houses they get to eat all the junk food they want. How can I make them appreciate the value of healthy eating? See, that's the difference between these lawyer types and me. If I have a problem with somebody I just tell them to their face, because that's what real men do. But these scum? They act as if everything's kosher and then a month later—like damn clockwork—you get a letter in the mail claiming you owe them another $6,500 in retroactive charges for ""services rendered."" Before you know it, you've got legal fees coming out of your ass, you're a month late on your alimony payments, and it's 3 a.m. and your ex-wife's lawyers have sent some guy over to spy on you and you know it's him because there's a green Tercel parked out front with its lights off and who the hell else could that be? And then, when you try to have a discussion with your ex-wife about it, all of a sudden you're ""in violation"" of some ridiculous court order that her lawyers probably tricked her into signing in the first place. See, that's when these guys start twisting words around:   your ex-wife's dog,   your ex-wife's dog—it's all the same to them! And then you have to go through four different lawyers, 11 or 12 prolonged hearings, and $15,000 in more fees just to establish in court that it was   who was hitting  . Come on! Where's the justice in that? Look, a man can only be pushed so far before he snaps. That's just a fact. So Mr. Hot Shot McLawyer over there can smirk all he wants for the judge, but we'll just see how big and tough he is when I drag his shyster ass out behind the courthouse and show him what's what. Take it from me. I've dealt with this kind of thing before.  ",1,Ask A Guy Who Knows A Little Bit About Dealing With These Lawyer Types
"ROCHESTER, NY—After years spent poring over mysterious and arcane plat sheets and deciphering long-forgotten building codes, city councilmember Mike LaMere unearthed the mysterious City Zoning Amulet  Friday. ""Behold!"" LaMere said, holding aloft the solid-gold amulet, which is emblazoned with the Ever-Evaluating Eye of Surr-Vey, Lord Of Demarcation, He Who Measures And Assesses. ""With this sigil, the power of zoning comes. Through me, the power of zoning flows! All will behold my power, and I shall bow to no man when designating matter-of-right developments for major retail and office spaces to a maximum lot occupancy of 75 percent for residential use!"" LaMere held the glowing amulet aloft and transmuted a neighborhood of low-income apartments into a semi-wooded, single-family, residential district with an adjoining riverside park. Though the amulet had long been dismissed as urban legend, a mythical ideal of zoning perfection handed down from city planner to city planner, LaMere became convinced that not only was it real, but that it had been used to lay out the cities of Ur, Atlantis, and Inver Grove Heights, MN. LaMere credited the amulet with the overnight renovation of the Monroe County Public Library, and the recent redesignation of a Southern Rochester area from ""commercial"" to ""single-family residential use for detached and semi-detached structures."" Many Rochester citizens believe the amulet is responsible for the  fully stocked ocean aquarium that materialized in the city center Sunday, and the gleaming new Friendly's restaurant that rose serenely over the banks of the Genesee River late Monday afternoon. Although the Rochester City Zoning Board controls all decisions related to city planning, sources at City Hall say that, as long as LaMere's powerful zoning wizardry is performed for the good of the city, they ""see no reason to deny him what seems to be his destiny."" ""Two weeks ago, the biggest news in Rochester was our huge public garage sale,"" said William A. Johnson, Rochester's mayor. ""Our city center was still a moribund tax burden with small businesses in big buildings and families moving to the suburbs in droves. Now, with a wave of his mighty amulet, Councilman LaMere can designate matter-of-right medium-density development, with limited offices for non-profit organizations, trade associations, and professionals permitted as a special exception requiring approval of the RCZA."" Despite the potential improvements to Rochester's civic landscape, some residents remain wary of LaMere's apparent bureaucratic invincibility. ""It's wonderful that someone's finally doing something to revitalize this town, even if it is someone who can commune with church gargoyles,"" said local baker Wendy Kittner, whose business was mystically placed on the National Register Of Historic Places last week despite being housed in a building erected in 1981. ""He frightens me, and my concern is that if I defy him, I may be turned to stone."" City planning commissioner Errol Criclow, who was dismissed by LaMere at a Planning And Zoning Commission hearing last Thursday as ""subhuman,"" said that he feared that LaMere's power would eventually corrupt him and his city. According to Criclow, during a private consultation with local community leaders, LaMere became infuriated with timid suggestions that his amulet be used to create more green spaces. In a blinding torrent of thunder and light, LaMere violently rezoned Rochester's west side with a maze of warehouses and parking garages. The act left LaMere himself dazed and shaken. ""For a minute there, he seemed his old self,"" said Criclow. ""When he saw what he'd done, he looked remorseful. But then his hand found the amulet, and he threw back his head and laughed long and loud, like a man who has forgotten the difference between industrial and recreational—between right and wrong."" Added Criclow: ""I don't think what he's doing is mere magic. I think it's darkest bureaucromancy."" ",1,City Councilman Unearths Magical Zoning Amulet
"WASHINGTON, DC–Following up on a Sept. 20 report that there is ""something really creepy about the place,"" Congress established an investigative panel Monday to find out just what's going on up at the old Parker mansion.
 ""Old Man Parker just disappeared one day, and ever since, all sorts of strange noises have been coming from up there,"" Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT) said. ""And I heard from one of the fellas in the General Accounting Office that there's a ton of old pirate doubloons up there. We've got to go up there and check it out.""
 After three hours of congressional debate, it was decided that the investigative panel would consist of Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS), because he's a real leader; Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), because he's small and good at sneaking into tight spots; and Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK), because, as a former NFL player, he's the most athletic member of Congress.
 After complaining long and hard about not being chosen, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was warned repeatedly not to follow the panel up Crooked Hill to the mansion, because it was too dangerous for a girl, and she would just slow them down.
 ""She'd better not follow us up there,"" Reed said. ""That old mansion doesn't have any lights, and there are a lot of rotten floorboards.""
 ""And they say,"" added Reed, becoming quieter, ""you can still see strange lights up there some nights, like Old Man Parker is still up there. Or…""
 ""If the distinguished senator from Rhode Island is trying to scare me, it won't work,"" interrupted Lott, banging his speaker's gavel. ""All that stuff about Old Man Parker's ghost is just a lot of baloney and you know it.""
 The exploratory committee plans to meet in the apple orchard on Friday, after Congress lets out. The group will then wait until nightfall before approaching the creepy, Victorian-style mansion.
 ""We have to be extra-careful not to be seen, because Mr. Clinton doesn't like us poking our noses into spooky, suspicious stuff,"" Largent said. ""He says it's too dangerous for federal legislators to investigate, and that it's [FBI director Louis] Freeh's job, so we should leave well enough alone. But is Freeh gonna go investigate a haunted house?""
 ""There's no such thing as ghosts, anyway,"" said Lott, checking the batteries in his flashlight. ""It always turns out to be marsh gas or a crazy old hobo or Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE) in a sheet or something. Remember when we solved the Case Of The Phantom Of The Strategic Petroleum Reserves? Some phantom! It was just old [Energy Secretary] Bill Richardson's parrot mimicking an oil tanker's foghorn!""
 Reed then reminded Lott that he ""sure was scared"" during a recent fact-finding mission to the eerie boathouse on the Potomac River. Just moments after Lott's oft-checked flashlight batteries failed, he lost his spectacles, leaving him alone in the dark with a ""giant bat"" later revealed to be a loose, windblown shutter.
 ""I think there really might be treasure up there,"" said Reed, whose home state of Rhode Island, the nation's smallest, is a place where a few Spanish pirate doubloons would go a long way. ""The Widow Adams once told me that Old Man Parker went to sea a lot in his youth, and that late one night during a big storm, she saw him bring an old sea-chest into the house. I bet it's full of gold.""
 ""The gold isn't the point,"" Largent said. ""The point is to find out what's going on up there, and what's making those lights, and what happened to Old Man Parker. If we have to camp out all night in that place to find out, that's what we'll do.""
 The panel is urging Congress to increase federal funding for the expedition, which will require a length of rope, extra flashlight batteries, three bottles of grape soda, and a jackknife. As of Tuesday, the trio had collected from Congress $4.74 million and a slingshot.
 ""Gee,"" Lott said, ""this slingshot sure will come in handy if we see Old Man Parker's ghost.""
 ""Or if Dianne shows up,"" added Reed, needling Lott. The senate majority leader was embarrassed this spring when he fled in terror from Feinstein, whom he had mistaken for the Creature From The Congressional Library. Lott's embarrassment only grew when the California senator pulled the candlestick in the Lincoln Bedroom, revealing the secret passage that ultimately led to the solving of the case.

"BELLE MEADE, TN—Belle Meade Day School kindergarten teacher Mrs. Allen, 33, says she has known since the first day of class that student Gregory Hutter, 6, was ""line-leader material."" ""He wasn't the tallest, but he conducted himself as if he were over four feet,"" Mrs. Allen said of Hutter, who she believes ""has what it takes"" to lead the class to key locations throughout the school such as the cafeteria, bathroom, water fountain, and to the playground. ""Once he's got his feet under him a bit more, the sky's the limit on where he can take this class."" Mrs. Allen realized that Hutter could maintain his composure in high-pressure situations several months ago when, after recess, he took a quick sip of water at the drinking fountain. ""He just had this innate sense that there were people waiting behind him who were also thirsty, and that the class was going to be late for music,"" she said. ""You can't teach that."" Most teachers, after seeing Hutter cry when his mother dropped him off for school during the first two weeks, would have dismissed Hutter's future leadership prospects, but Mrs. Allen reportedly ""kept on the boy."" She forced him to complete his noodle necklace and printing drills with precision, despite the obvious emotional strain. ""I had to break him a little bit, but I was just preparing him for the kind of focus one needs to line lead,"" said Mrs. Allen, a former line leader, who admitted she sees a little bit of herself in Hutter. ""I look out for the kid, help him grow. To be honest, I'm a little jealous. If I'd had a kindergarten teacher tell me to not swing my arms around wildly when I was his age, I might have one day grown up to be class president."" According to Mrs. Allen, she really started to think Hutter was ""the real deal"" when she gave him the responsibility of being the class's milk monitor last month. Though there were a few spills early on, Mrs. Allen said Hutter never got lost between the classroom and the cafeteria, and always returned promptly and avoided dillydallying.  ""He's got what it takes to be another Tommy Masterson, or even a Lisa Wodtke,"" said Mrs. Allen, referring to outstanding line leaders from 1998 and 1995, respectively, whose high school careers she continues to follow. When primary line leader Lauren Gratchic came down with chicken pox in mid-January, Mrs. Allen immediately tapped Hutter for the post. ""It was sink or swim—and he swam,"" she said. Heading out to recess, Hutter noticed there was construction near the playground, and held the line even though his teacher continued forward.

Mrs. Allen spoke cautiously about the imminent transfer of line-leading power, even as she praised Hutter's ""seemingly innate"" ability to always face forward and not peer into other classrooms while leading his classmates to the cafeteria. ""Sure he's good—shockingly good—and I even think he'd be able to share authority gracefully at times, like when the class has to split up into two lines to enter school assemblies,"" Mrs. Allen said.

"I'm sick and tired of ghosts visiting my bed-chamber. At first, I admit, it was terrifying. Then, it became endearing. But now, it is down-right tire-some.
 First, the ghost of my father, Herman Ulysses Zweibel, manifested himself above my four-poster death-bed, cackling wildly and rattling his chains. My horror knew no bounds. Mortified, I begged for his mercy, but he only cackled some more.
 He kept cackling. And cackling still. It was so infectious, I could not keep a straight face. So I began to cackle, or at least offer up the closest thing to a cackle my near-ossified vocal cords could muster. We both kept cackling on through the night. It was a charming moment that only a long-dead father and his near-death son could share.
 As I cackled, I began to realize that there wasn't a lot that Pater's ghost could actually do except float around, rattle his chains, and cackle. My fear gave way to not a small amount of disappointment. I stopped cackling and drifted off to sleep. When I awoke, Pater's ghost was still there, hovering above the bed and staring at me blankly.
 ""Can't you at least knock over the armoire or make a window slam shut, or some such haunting-action?"" I demanded.
 ""No,"" he replied. ""The chains limit my mobility.""
 As the weeks drifted by, Pater continued to hover about my bed-chamber, occasionally moaning or shaking a chain or two. Then, one day, I heard an unearthly moan quite unlike the whimpers emitted by Pater. Suddenly, before my eyes appeared the ghost of my one-time bosom friend and business associate, the ruth-less steel magnate J. Titian McBrodie.
 ""A WARNING FROM BEYOND, FRIEND ZWEIBEL!"" McBrodie's ghost bellowed. ""REPENT YOUR EVIL WAYS OR SUFFER AN ETERNITY IN HELL-FIRE!""
 My blood ran cold, and my mortal fright returned in full force. ""J. Titian!"" I cried. ""Your ghostly warning has served as a bracing wake-up call to me! In my remaining days, you have my solemn word, I will try my best to make up for my century of sin and wrong-doing!""
 ""JUST KIDDING!"" McBrodie's ghost replied. ""THERE'S ACTUALLY NO HELL AT ALL! HEAVEN EITHER! I WAS JUST FUNNING YOU! HOW THE DEVIL ARE YOU, ZWEIBEL OLD CHUM?""
 I was so filled with disgust that I could scarcely speak. Instead, I let the two monotonous apparitions hover about and compare boring notes with one another as I received my daily enema. ",1,Ghost-Buster

"NEWPORT, RI—Eighteen people were disappointed and six left badly unsatiated Saturday when guests at the Newport Yacht Club's annual Harborside Regatta were served mahi mahi that one patron described as ""still a little pink inside.""
 ""It was most certainly not the best dolphin I've ever had,"" said shipbuilder J. Bradford Hunt, 51, of the undergrilled seafood dish, which was served near the conclusion of what another club member termed ""an otherwise smashing regatta.""
 ""I make no excuses,"" said club president Latrobe P. Chatterton IV at a hastily announced press conference yesterday. ""Ultimately, the responsibility lies with me. I am submitting my resignation to the Board of Trustees, effective noon tomorrow, but I will continue to monitor the situation closely from my villa in Majorca.""
 Chatterton's wife Lydia was among the most seriously disappointed by the mahi mahi. Immediately after the meal, she was rushed by private jet to the Mojave Spa in Palm Springs, CA, where she was treated with mineral-rich natural mud baths. A spokesman for the spa described her prognosis as ""hopeful.""
 The annual Harborside Regatta, which has long been one of the most important events on the Yacht Club's summer social calendar, was attended this year by more than 300 moguls, tycoons, dowagers, magnates and scions.
 Chatterton described the Regatta-ending dinner ""as a chance for the yachtsmen and -women to unwind from their day's rigors in a comfortable, casual atmosphere among their social peers."" But at some point between the saffron, pork and caramelized-leek soup and the honey-glazed passionfruit sorbet, ""something went terribly wrong.""
 ""I could tell right away,"" said Amanda Worthingford-Wells, 25. ""All the fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes in the world couldn't mask it. I tried to tell Daddy, but he had already taken a forkful and was knitting his brow in haughty chagrin… it was awful.""
 ""It was a lovely day,"" recalled Blythe Harrison, 73, a matriarch of the Boston Harrisons. ""We passed the time taking in the sea air and chatting, although some of the more sporting gentlemen engaged in competitive races that quite thrilled us all…  We had only come to idle purposelessly. Then this happened.""
 This is not the first disaster to strike the Newport Yacht Club in recent years.  A 1991 breakdown of the club-to-harbor jitney inconvenienced over 75 people, and in 1993, a fire killed a shoe-shine boy, leaving club members' loafers scuffed for six days.
 Although the Yacht Club was open for members today, many stayed away.  ""I think there's a certain stigma attached now,"" explained one member.""Also, today's the Pawtucket Dog Show."" ",1,Yacht Club Regatta Marred By Tragic Undergrilling Of Mahi Mahi

"HOUSTON–Controversy has engulfed a suburban Einstein Bagels store, where for months a business-card drawing for a free bagel sandwich has been mired in corruption, store sources reported Monday.
 ""I thought a weekly drawing would be a fun way to bring in the lunch crowd,"" store manager and contest creator Tim Bednarik said. ""I had no idea how many problems a free-sandwich giveaway could create.""
 Thirteen weeks ago, Bednarik kicked off the contest by placing a fishbowl at the front register, inviting customers to ""Drop In A Business Card And Win A FREE Bagel Sandwich!"" Since then, Bednarik said, there have been at least 10 confirmed cases of drawing-related fraud, including business-card falsification, fishbowl stuffing, and illegal removal of competing cards.
 ""I've had people try to claim that they won a free sandwich when they didn't,"" Bednarik said. ""I've had employees messing with the bowl. It's been one headache after another.""
 As stipulated by Bednarik, every Sunday evening, after the store is closed, a new business card is to be drawn from the fishbowl in preparation for an announcement the following morning. The winning business card is thumb-tacked to a bulletin board under the heading ""This Week's Lucky Winner!"" and the previous week's winner is relocated to another section of the bulletin board under the heading ""Past Winners."" Winners have 10 days to claim their free sandwich.
 Despite Bednarik's efforts to preserve the integrity of the contest, many customers have cried foul.
 ""This is the second week in a row that someone from that bookstore across the street has won,"" said Lynne Rangel, 39, an M&G Advertising administrative assistant and regular Einstein lunch patron. ""I think someone working at Einstein's has friends over there. That's not fair.""
 Added Rangel: ""Maybe I should take my business down to Schlotzky's Deli.""
 While the charges of bookstore favoritism remain unproven, other cases of sandwich graft have been confirmed. Several weeks ago, Bednarik discovered that employees had been sifting through the bowl to select winners, rather than simply sticking their hands in and blindly pulling out a card.
 ""We were all bored, so we'd go through all the cards and check out where everyone worked,"" said Einstein employee Dan Pruitt, 20. ""We found this one guy whose last name was Luyck, and we thought it'd be funny if a guy named 'luck' won, so we picked him.""
 Pruitt and fellow employee Debi Richards, 21, admitted to hand-picking as many as four sandwich winners. Among them was Vince Neff.
 ""It said on [Neff's] card that he was the owner of a janitorial-supply store,"" said Richards, wiping down a table. ""We thought it'd be cool to see him win a free sandwich instead of one of those lawyer or business-guy assholes who come in here for lunch all the time.""
 Though Pruitt and Richards were caught by Bednarik and stripped of their winner-selecting privileges, the corruption continued.
 ""I saw that one tall bearded guy with the windbreaker hanging around by the register,"" employee Greg Fontana said. ""Then, when he left, I noticed the bowl was half empty. I think he took some of the cards. It was either him or those raver kids with the backpacks.""
 Fontana said he has also spotted at least two other customers dropping in stacks of cards and then shuffling the cards in the bowl to conceal their illicit deed.
 ""The sign clearly says 'One Card Per Visit, Please!'"" Fontana said. ""I mean, what the fuck?""
 Still more problems arose over the issue of what constitutes a free sandwich.
 ""We had one guy come in here to get his free sandwich, and he orders double everything–double cheese, double ham, double tomatoes. I mean, the thing was loaded,"" cashier Christine Lilly said. ""Then he asks for a single extra bagel on the side. Well, I don't have to tell you what he was planning to do with all those extras.""
 One customer went so far as to question the intrinsic fairness of a bagel-sandwich giveaway that requires a business card to participate.
 ""Why should I not get a chance to win a free sandwich, just because I don't have a business card?"" customer and self-employed watercolor artist Diane Maurer said. ""I feel like I'm being punished for not working in a corporate office.""
 The controversy swirling around the drawing has been a major blow to Bednarik, whose aim was to generate excitement and foster positive Einstein-related feelings throughout his customer base.
 ""I should have known this would happen, considering the whole punch-card debacle,"" said Bednarik, referring to an October 1999 Einstein promotion in which customers could collect punches on a card to get an 11th cup of coffee free. ""We had people asking for cards with seven or eight punches to replace cards they claimed they'd lost. We had people bringing in cards with punches that didn't match the shape of our puncher. That month was hell.""
 As a stopgap measure, Bednarik has temporarily removed the fishbowl from the register area.
 ""I'd like to think we can do something nice for our customers,"" Bednarik said. ""It's a shame, but maybe it just isn't possible in this day and age."" ",1,Business-Card Drawing For Free Sandwich Mired In Scandal

"CHARLOTTE, NC–After two and a half years of subtle prodding and manipulation, Jill Nickles has finally molded boyfriend Brendan Eiler into the sort of man in whom she's not interested.
 ""When I first met Brendan, he was a guitarist for [local rock band] The Heavy Petters, and I couldn't take my eyes off him,"" said Nickles, 28. ""I used to go to Tramp's every Thursday night just to watch him play. He wasn't even the most handsome guy in the world, but he just had this mystique, this air of danger about him. He was really exciting. It's too bad he's not like that anymore.""
 After several months of watching him from the crowd, Nickles finally introduced herself to Eiler after a show in September 1998. They soon began dating.
 ""Brendan was everything I wanted in a man,"" Nickles said. ""He was unpredictable, smart, and passionate. I knew he wasn't perfect, but he was really fun to be around–which is more than I can say for him now.""
 Just weeks into the relationship, Nickles began to notice changes.
 ""It started pretty early,"" Nickles said. ""Instead of being the wild man he'd been, more and more he'd just stay home like a lump, even on nights I told him it was okay if he went out.""
 Four months to the day after their first date, Nickles moved into Eiler's one-bedroom apartment. The move only accelerated the changes in him.
 ""Jill and I weren't living together long before she started getting irritated by how small the apartment was,"" Eiler said. ""She was always complaining about how she didn't have space anymore. Then, she got this idea to get a bigger place, but I couldn't really afford it, since I was just barely scraping by with what I earned bartending at Mickey's. I really liked bartending, and it allowed me flexible hours for band practice and gigs. But, like Jill said, I was 25 now and shouldn't be living hand-to-mouth.""
 At Nickles' urging, Eiler quit his job at Mickey's and landed a position at SFR Solutions, a Charlotte-area web-design firm. The job paid nearly $4,000 a year more than bartending, enabling the couple to move into a larger apartment.
 With a full-time job and a live-in girlfriend, Eiler's relationship with his bandmates soon began to deteriorate.
 ""They kept wanting to play more and more gigs, and I felt like if we wanted to land a record deal, what I needed to do was stay home and write some strong new material,"" Eiler said. ""Even Jill had stopped going to see us because she said she was getting sick of hearing the same songs–and she was our number-one fan. Finally, they said I had to make more time for shows or they'd get a new guitarist. I was like, 'Screw you guys,' and left. Jill pointed out that the band wasn't really going anywhere anyway, and that I was better off in no band at all than one made up of a bunch of unambitious losers.""
 Upon quitting the band, Eiler's lifestyle changes accelerated. In September 2000, he cut his long mane of hair in an effort to land a promotion to associate design director at SFR Solutions. Nickles also convinced him to become a vegetarian and sell his customized leather jacket to put a down payment on a new Toyota Camry.
 ""When we first started dating, Jill loved how I looked in that jacket,"" Eiler said. ""But then, a few months later, she said I was getting too old to wear something like that. Plus, it didn't really gibe with my new vegetarian beliefs. So, with Jill's full support, I decided it was time to put my old ways to rest.""
 Now a self-described homebody, Eiler said he finds his domestic lifestyle ""really satisfying.""
 ""If you told me two years ago that I'd be thinking of marriage, a house with a picket fence, and kids, I would have said you were nuts,"" Eiler said. ""All I used to care about was hanging with my friends and having a good time. I guess it's true that the love of a good woman can really change you for the better.""
 Despite Nickles' success in sculpting Eiler into ""husband material,"" she found her attraction for him beginning to wane.
 ""The reason I fell so hard for Brendan was that he was totally different from the guys I used to date,"" Nickles said. ""He had beautiful long hair, and he was really smart and cynical. Now he reminds me of my boring ex-boyfriend Kevin, who's an accountant in Raleigh.""
 Even though Nickles' nights of going out to see The Heavy Petters are long over, she still enjoys going out on occasion.
 ""A couple of weeks ago, I was at the bar Brendan and I used to go to all the time,"" Nickles said. ""I ran into Rob, the bassist for Brendan's old band and, I have to tell you, he looked really good. We hung out and talked for hours and just had a great time. Drinking and laughing with him really reminded me of the way it used to be with Brendan. I think I'm developing a little crush on Rob.""

"CHICAGO–His flight from O'Hare to LaGuardia delayed more than six hours, Hamas militant and would-be suicide bomber Nidal Hanani vowed never again to fly United Airlines. ""I do   have time for this,"" said Hanani, seated at a Burger King in Concourse C, a plastic-explosives-filled duffel bag at his feet. ""My   against the West was supposed to be carried out shortly after takeoff at 8:35 this morning. It is now 2:50 p.m. How much longer must I sit around this airport like an idiot before God's will is done?"" Added Hanani: ""They said the plane is still in Denver, where they are still waiting for a pilot from another flight. Screwed up, this United is."" Compounding Hanani's frustration is the fact that his two previous flights–a commuter shuttle from Assira al-Shamaliyeh to Damascus followed by a redeye from Damascus to Chicago–were also delayed by more than four hours each. ""The bile churns within me, I am so outraged,"" Hanani said. ""I go to the ticket counter, and the females wearing men's clothing tell me, 'We can put you on standby and try to get you on a 4 p.m. flight.' Why do they say this word, 'try'? I did not buy a ticket for a 4 p.m. flight. I buy a ticket for a 8:35 a.m. flight."" ""I have kneeled toward Mecca three times today already,"" added Hanani, gesturing eastward in the direction of a TCBY stand. ""Still I wait."" Shortly after 3 p.m., Sherrie Walker, a United Airlines representative, announced that anyone on Flight 225 willing to give up his or her seat and fly early the next day would receive overnight lodging and a $500 voucher good for travel on United anywhere in the continental U.S. Hanani declined the offer. ""Why should I want to fly again on this lousy airline that has given me nothing but the most profound of aggravation? Even for a free $500 ticket, it is not worth it,"" Hanani said. ""Besides, I cannot wait even one more day to deliver my urgent message to the world that Islam is the true religion of God and that its truth is manifest in its power."" United Airlines spokespersons blamed the delay on a combination of factors, citing bad weather in the airline's Denver hub and the ongoing labor dispute with its pilots union. The pilots' refusal to work overtime in protest of the pace of contract talks has been a major factor in United canceling as many as 20,000 flights this summer. ""I do not care about labor problems,"" said Hanani, fidgeting with his small, radio-activated bomb detonator. ""All I know is, I pay for ticket, I expect to fly. If these infidels cannot fly me, they should not take my money. I would not have such headaches on Syrian Arab Airlines, that is for certain."" Hanani then rose and walked to a wall of monitors to read the list of scheduled departures for the fifth time in less than an hour. ""Why are these airlines so incompetent?"" Hanani asked fellow frustrated traveler Colleen Mayes, who was stranded at O'Hare when her Delta Airlines flight to Salt Lake City was canceled after a five-hour delay. ""It can only be the lack of discipline in this corrupt, immoral Western country."" ""At least I am far less helpless than all the other Flight 225 passengers who wait with me,"" continued Hanani, eating a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza he bought for ""a ridiculous amount of money."" ""Unlike them, I shall reach my destination–the Kingdom of Heaven."" One problem Hanani has not encountered is interference from O'Hare security. When Flight 225 finally does take off, the fundamentalist's bomb, disguised as a piece of geological research equipment, is expected to kill all 300-plus passengers and crew members. ""I was afraid they would tell me that my bag is too big to be carry-on and that I must check it,"" Hanani said. ""The detonator signal does not work if the bag is underneath plane. Fortunately, I was able to take as carry-on. Praise God."" Informed of Hanani's dissatisfaction, United customer-service supervisor Bill Stringer offered his apologies. ""We're very sorry that one of our valued customers has been inconvenienced by our travel delays,"" Stringer said. ""But I can assure Mr. Hanani that we are taking every step possible to get him to his destination just as soon as we can. United Airlines is fully committed to addressing its problems and providing better service in the future."" For now, Hanani continues to wait. All he can do, he said, is hope there are no further delays. ""Upon my death, be it 6 p.m. or 9:30 or midnight, I know I shall be rewarded manifold for my stalwartness,"" Hanani said. ""But try my patience, this incompetent airline does. On the Day of Judgment, may United's employees and those of its subsidiaries be condemned to the pits of Hell for all eternity.""

"Barely a day goes by when someone doesn't scrunch their nose at me and say, ""Hey, Roger, don't you believe in using soap?"" To which I reply, ""Oh, I believe in it. I'm just no good at it.""
 You'd think people would understand. All the time, I hear folks say things like, ""I'm not a math person"" or, ""I'm terrible with names"" or, ""I can't golf to save my life,"" only to be chided goodheartedly. Yet when I say, ""I'm really bad with soap,"" you should see the odd looks I get.
 I mean, people who have difficulty with math don't get calculators left on their desks. But you offhandedly mention to your coworkers that you just don't ""get soap"" and what happens? Little ""gifts"" of soap, shampoo, and bath beads start showing up in your cubicle. What the heck am I supposed to do with them? It's like giving a ratchet set to a guy who's just told you he's lousy with cars. I either give these so-called presents to the homeless or toss them in the trash where they belong.
 It's hard enough dealing with the hairy eyeball at the office, but getting grief from my family–well, that just stings. Every time I call Mom, she asks me if I'm taking showers, which I am. Then she asks if I use soap, and I'm like, ""Come on, Mom, you know how it is with me and soap."" I don't see her giving my brother Gene grief for being a terrible bowler, so why do I always have to get harassed about my little soap weakness?
 Is it really the end of the world that I'm a lousy soaper? I mean, can't we focus on my positives? I don't chew with my mouth open. I speak clearly. I get my work done in a timely, efficient manner. I just have this mental block when it comes to soap. It's not like I urinate in the sink or talk about abortions while everybody's eating. Gee whiz.
 I used to think this whole soap thing might have something to do with me being left-handed. You know how left-handed people are more creative because they're dominated by their right brain? Well, I asked my doctor if the part of the brain that controls your ability to use soap is the right or left side, and he said he didn't know. I thought doctors had to know stuff like that before they started operating on people.
 Rather than get down on myself, I try to look at my lack of soaping skills as something that makes me unique. Sometimes, as a joke, someone will call me Pig Pen, like the guy from the   comic. I'm pretty sure they're trying to hurt my feelings, but I just remind myself that Pig Pen was pretty cool, pretty laid-back and sure of himself. He was always doing his own thing, just like me. Plus, most of the other characters in the strip seem to accept that he's just a dusty kid. (Except Lucy, but she's just a crank nobody really likes anyway.)
 When I was a little kid, a lot of my friends were bad with soap. But then, sometime around age 13, they all started getting really good at it. Except me. My parents figured I'd start using soap when I hit puberty. But I'm 27 now, and my soaping abilities have not developed at all. I've decided to not worry about it, though. After all, if I don't have it by this point, I'm never going to have it.
 Maybe one day, a meteor will crash to Earth, and I'll touch it and it will magically turn me into a tenth-level master soaper. But until that day comes, I guess I'll have to make do with tap water and the forcible hose-downs I get from time to time. ",1,"Oh, I'm No Good With Soap"
"WASHINGTON, DC–With drought conditions approaching critical levels in the Deep South, Great Plains, and Southwest, Congress allocated some major moolah toward relief efforts in the afflicted regions Monday.
 The federal-aid package, all 14.8 billion samoleans of it, will be allocated in the form of emergency irrigation, crop subsidies, and long-term low-interest loans to farmers living in counties declared agricultural disaster areas.
 ""Ka-ching!"" Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) told reporters, cranking his right arm in imitation of an old-time cash register. ""The American farmer may be suffering through some of the worst drought conditions of the last half-century, but thanks to this much-needed aid, he'll soon be swimmin' in some serious smackeroos. Those living in the hardest-hit areas should find their wallets fatter to the tune of a cool hundred Gs per farmer.""
 ""And brother,"" continued Hastert, winking and elbowing reporters, ""that ain't hay.""
 Congress' decision to give up the cheddar comes in the wake of near-record temperatures throughout much of the nation, with parts of Texas and New Mexico averaging 110 degrees since July. As wildfires continued to spread across the Rocky Mountain region and the prospect of drought-related food-price hikes loomed, legislators unanimously approved a chunk of relief change that would choke a goat.
 ""Oh, yeah,"" Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) said. ""Mmm-hmmm. Montana's farmers and ranchers, devastated by months of drought and wildfire, have got 14.8 billion big ones coming to them, baby.

"CINCINNATI—Explaining that her statements indicated a failure to understand and implement the district’s goal of providing a comprehensive education to all children, Jefferson High School officials reportedly fired 10th-grade chemistry teacher Jennifer Steenman today after she was heard saying she learns more from her students than they do from her. “I just love being around the students—I honestly think I get more out of these classes than the kids do,” said Steenman, who was later summoned into a meeting with the school’s principal where she was informed that her contract would be terminated immediately for gross incompetence. “I learn something new from them each and every day. They teach me so much—far more than I could ever teach them.” The dismissal reportedly follows a series of reprimands from administrators, who recorded Steenman on numerous occasions stating that her curriculum was less about chemistry, per se, and more about learning how to learn.

"GRANGER, IN–Looking good is an essential component of Gregg Rafalski's success as a real-estate agent, the 35-year-old RE/MAX employee asserted Monday. ""As a real-estate agent, my appearance is crucial,"" Rafalski said. ""On any given day, I'm interacting with a large number of people: clients, property owners, business associates. It's of the utmost importance that I convey professionalism to my customers and colleagues at all times."" To this end, Rafalski said he always wears a freshly pressed shirt, a ""smart-looking"" tie, well-polished shoes, and a minimal amount of carefully chosen jewelry, usually a watch and one ring. He also makes sure that his fingernails are clean and neatly trimmed. ""Buying a home is one of the most important decisions a person can make–many are sinking their entire life savings into it,"" Rafalski said. ""That's why I need to project an air of confidence to my clients. Rumpled khaki pants and an untucked polo shirt are simply not going to cut it when you're looking to say, 'I am fully in control of this situation.'"" Though he graduated from high school with only a C average, Rafalski ""aced"" his subsequent 54-hour real-estate pre-licensing course at Michiana College in nearby South Bend. After completing the course, Rafalski passed the Indiana Real Estate Commission examination and gained his licensure in 1984. He has spent the past 17 years in commercial and residential real-estate, including the past six at RE/MAX. Rafalski said he learned the importance of looking good early in his career. ""I attended quite a few [Indiana Commercial Board of Realtors] conferences during those first few years on the job, and I was lucky enough to meet some tremendous salespeople to serve as my role models,"" Rafalski said. ""Because of the way they looked and carried themselves, these guys could walk into a room and, within two seconds, all eyes would be squarely on them. They could sell a drink of water to a fish."" It was at these early conferences that Rafalski learned ""the true meaning of sales."" ""Many people mistakenly think the success of a salesman is determined by your knowledge of the product,"" Rafalski said. ""Sure, you need to know how old this house is or what the property taxes are on that one, but that's what briefcases are for. It's not the house, it's   that you're really selling to a customer."" Added Rafalski: ""Speaking of briefcases, this one is imported Italian leather."" To look his best, Rafalski keeps abreast of current fashions. Two Fridays a month, he leaves work early and drives down to Glenbrook Square Mall in Fort Wayne, nearly 70 miles away. ""The Marshall Field's at University Park doesn't always carry the Hugo Boss shirts I like,"" Rafalski said. ""So, every so often, I like to take a little trip down to Fort Wayne. I know that sounds crazy, but, believe me, when a potential home buyer is on the fence, the right shirt can turn an 'I'll pass' into an 'I'll take it.'"" Unlike his less successful colleagues, Rafalski doesn't waste his office hours keeping track of property values or brushing up on zoning changes. Instead, he browses online for hard-to-find items from his favorite brand names, including Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, and Ralph Lauren. ""If you dress cheap, you are cheap–it's that simple,"" Rafalski said. ""Same thing goes for houses: Cheap houses, cheap commissions. That's just not my mindset."" In addition to his wardrobe, Rafalski's choice of transportation plays an important role in the impression he makes. He drives a red 2000 Chrysler Sebring convertible, which sends a strong message when he arrives for a house showing. ""What would a potential home buyer think if I pulled up in a dinky little Honda?"" Rafalski asked. ""Would that instill confidence in my abilities as an agent? I don't think so."" Rafalski also puts care into the appearance of his office at RE/MAX, which he keeps meticulously clean and decorated with silver curios and framed art prints. ""When someone walks into my office and sees the Waterford vase and Nicoletti leather chair, they know I know what I'm doing,"" Rafalski said. ""Why would you entrust your search for a home to an agent who doesn't even care what his own office looks like?"" Rafalski's attention to detail has not gone unnoticed among clients. ""Gregg always looks so nice,"" said Adrienne Bauer, whom Rafalski is helping find a larger location for her Wicks 'N' Wax store. ""I wish my husband would wear some of the newer tie styles, but he won't. He always says, 'I'm a pediatrician, not Regis Philbin.'"" Rafalski's coworkers are equally impressed. ""The clients really seem to like Gregg,"" said Granger RE/MAX senior real-estate broker Jonathan Quirk. ""He's not necessarily our best agent when it comes to knowing his way around the neighborhood, but he still gets a heck of a lot of referrals and repeat customers. I think it might be his hair or something. He's got real nice hair."" ",1,"As Real-Estate Agent, Area Man's Appearance Crucial"
"CRYSTAL LAKE, IL–Despite his deep commitment to the sanctity and seriousness of the Word of God, Pastor Clark Lundegaard likes to incorporate a little humor into his weekly sermons, the spiritual leader of Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church admitted Sunday.
 ""Humor is a great way to reach people. Often, at the start of a sermon, I'll drop a little joke in there just to set people at ease,"" said Lundegaard, 54. ""After all, the church isn't just about dogma, obedience, doctrine, and the maintenance of strict proprietary standards–it's also about having fun.""
 Examples of Lundegaard's humorous antics abound. On a recent Sunday, the reading was Ezekiel 6:14, in which God angrily tells the prophet, ""And I shall stretch forth my hand upon them: and I shall make the land desolate and abandoned, from the desert of Deblatha, in all their dwelling places: and they shall know that I am the Lord thy God."" To offset the stern passage, Lundegaard ""lightened things up a bit"" with a humorous story.
 ""He told a joke about a Norwegian, a Dutchman, and a German who were ice fishing when they heard a booming, angry voice from above telling them that there were no fish under the ice,"" said Patricia Dundee, 36, Holy Christ Almighty choir director and mother of four. ""It turned out, the voice wasn't God at all; it was a loudspeaker saying, 'This is the rink manager. There are no fish under the ice!' So we all had a little laugh over that one.""
 ""Because you'd have to be pretty silly to try ice fishing in a skating rink,"" Dundee added.
 Dundee's husband Bill enjoyed the joke, as well. ""The nice thing about it was that lots of us here at the church are German or Dutch, but since Pastor Clark himself is Norwegian, he wasn't just poking fun at us, but at himself, too.""
 When he first arrived at Holy Christ Almighty in 1984, Lundegaard stirred controversy among parishioners with his unorthodox use of humor. But over time, a majority of the flock has come to appreciate his slightly irreverent approach.
 ""Pastor Clark is a real cut-up up there in the pulpit,"" said Grace Manheim, 67. ""Some of his jokes can be pretty corny at times, but as long as it doesn't get in the way of the sermon's message or undermine the solemnity of the Bible lessons for the day, I don't see anything wrong with it.""
 ""Oh, sure, often during services, you might hear a big, collective groan from the congregation once they see what's coming,"" said Lundegaard, who also enjoys drawing comical ""parody"" cartoons for the church bulletin. ""But even though they sometimes act like they hate my jokes, I know that deep down, they really love it.""
 Humor also comes in handy for Lundegaard during the special ""children's sermon"" portion of the service, during which the youngest church members are called up to the front to sit in a circle on the floor as Lundegaard speaks to them directly. Though many children are nervous at first, the pastor's use of humor helps ""break the ice.""
 ""A few months ago, when Pastor Clark did a children's sermon about baptism, he put on a little puppet show, and the puppets got blasted with one of those big super-soaker squirt guns,"" churchgoer Fran Helger said. ""Our three-year-old just loved it.""
 ""Boy, nobody saw that one coming,"" said Lundegaard when asked about the incident. ""It was a real 'laugh riot,' as the young people say."" Though he admitted that some of the older church members felt it was a little inappropriate to have squirt guns in church, Lundegaard said that if a joke works, one shouldn't shy away from mildly controversial material.
 ""Speaking of children's sermons, here's a funny little story for you,"" Lundegaard said. ""This pastor was talking to a group of kids and, to illustrate a point, he asked, 'Does anybody know what's small, furry, has a bushy tail, and runs up trees looking for nuts?' All the kids were silent but, finally, one little boy said, 'Well, I know the answer is Jesus, but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me!'""
 Lundegaard then laughed good-naturedly for 15 to 20 seconds.
 ""That's a good one!"" he added. ""Isn't that a cute one?""
 Lundegaard's wife, homemaker Patty Lundegaard, who has heard the humorous anecdote an estimated 1,400 times over the course of their 26-year marriage, groaned audibly.
 Despite Lundegaard's standing as a community leader and man of God, his humor is not always 100 percent wholesome. Parishioners say that during social outings, in the presence of couples he knows well or if he's had a few glasses of wine, he will tell the occasional ""blue,"" or dirty, joke as long as there are no children nearby.
 ""I had no idea there were so many religious-themed dirty jokes, but Pastor Clark's got a million of them,"" said Len Branniff, church-council treasurer and Lundegaard's longtime golfing buddy. ""Like the one about the elderly Lutheran who got a waterbed, and his wife called it 'The Dead Sea.' Or the one he told me about the dizzy blonde who went to church because she heard there was a guy in there that was hung like this–""
 Branniff then outstretched his arms in the posture of the crucified Christ, visually delivering the joke's risqué punchline.
 ""Sure, it's a bit off-color,"" Branniff said, ""but nobody here in town questions Pastor Clark's sincere love of Jesus or his commitment to the church's mission. His jokes are a big part of fostering fellowship here at Holy Christ Almighty.""
 For all his joking, Lundegaard stressed that the most important humor is that which has meaning and can help people understand the mysteries of faith in ways they can apply to their everyday lives.
 ""Sometimes, when confronted with the majesty and mystery of God's vast creation, we can get a little overwhelmed. That's where jokes can help us keep our feet on the ground and bring the whole process down to Earth,"" Lundegaard said. ""It's like the time Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson went camping. There they were, staring up at the stars, and Sherlock asked, 'Watson, what does this beautiful sight mean to you? What can we learn from this?' Well, Watson thought about it as hard as he could and, finally, he said, 'Well, Holmes, it means we are all just insignificant dots in a larger whole, and that even though the universe may be unfathomable, there is a larger plan,' and this and that, on and on, until he was so confused he didn't know what to think. Finally, Watson gave up and said, 'What do you think, Holmes?'""
 ""And Holmes said, 'Elementary, my dear Watson,'"" Lundegaard said. ""'It means somebody stole our tent.""
 Lundegaard then laughed for several seconds, adding, ""Ain't it the truth, though?"" with a sly wink. ",1,Area Pastor Likes To Inject A Little Humor Into His Sermons

"WASHINGTON, DC–Hopes of finding more survivors of Monday's Senate Mine disaster are fading, as a second full day of rescue efforts proved futile Wednesday.
 In all, 57 legislators remain buried deep within the Senate Mine, the southern shaft of which collapsed without warning at 7:57 a.m. Monday. Rescue workers say the likelihood of finding survivors is slim.
 ""The area where the senators were digging is one of the narrowest in the entire mine,"" said Tom Asheton of the Red Cross. ""We know for sure that the passageways on both sides of the corridor were sealed off in the initial blast, so the senators probably ran out of oxygen sometime yesterday afternoon. We'll give it another go first thing tomorrow morning, but at this point, it doesn't look good. Lord help those brave lawmakers.""
 Asheton then called upon all Americans to pray for the senators.
 At 7 a.m. Monday, as they do every week, the nation's 100 senators donned their lantern helmets, took up shovels, and descended the main shaft by rope elevator to excavate the rich seam of coal recently discovered in the mine's Great Southern Drift.   transcripts of intercom communications indicate that operations were proceeding smoothly, with drill operators encountering no more than the normal resistance from rocky occlusions, when a sudden rumbling was heard.
 ""From way down the shaft, I could hear [Sen.] Judd [Gregg (R-NH)] shouting, 'The pilings! The pilings!'"" said senate majority foreman Trent Lott (R-MS), whose leg was badly contused by falling mine tailings and who had to be restrained by aides from reentering the mine to save his colleagues. ""Then there was this incredible roar, and all the lamps blew out. I remember thinking, 'Please, God, no: There's still so much important legislation to pass–and coal to dig.'""
 At 8:08 a.m., the mine whistle on the Capitol dome sounded the emergency warning. Within minutes, senators' loved ones began assembling at the mine's entrance to watch rescuers going about their grim work. One after another, the grimy, blue-suited bodies of senators were dragged from the mine.
 ""These are brave men,"" said Lott, his face still blackened with soot. ""Despite our ongoing bipartisan struggles, with the Democrats arguing for shorter hours down-shaft and Republicans supporting less restrictive mining regulations, there has been nothing but brotherhood today.""
 The cause of the mine's collapse remains unknown. No smoke or heat has been detected emanating from the shaft, ruling out the possibility that a hammer-drill struck sparks and ignited the abundant coal dust that fills the senatorial chambers.
 Senators who had been working in the mine's central shaft say oxygen levels were normal. They also noted that congressional pages positioned in the mine to monitor air quality were chatting happily just seconds before the disaster. Survivors' accounts seem to point to a straightforward collapse, which, experts note, is an ever-present danger when legislators excavate in the wet rock near the Potomac.
 ""Of all the industrial ventures run by the federal government, the coal-mining operations of the legislative branch have always had the worst safety record,"" said Cliff Stephney, president of the United Senatorial Mine Workers of America. ""Just last year, we almost lost the entire Senate Armed Services Committee when the hay bales they feed the cart-horses 'down the hole' somehow caught fire.""
 Stephney noted that Supreme Court & Southern Railroad brakemen, statistically the second most dangerous job in American government, had a 17 percent better chance of seeing retirement without injury.
 Unsafe as congressional mining may be, few other options are available to unskilled elected officials.
 ""Every year, we say we're going to pass laws that make our jobs safer,"" said senator and rock hog Mitch ""Mule"" McConnell (R-KY), who has the distinction of surviving both Monday's collapse and the infamous Library of Congress Foundry Explosion of 1999. ""But when a man gets down to voting, he remembers how much he owes to the Capitol store, and that's usually the end of that. I mean, times being what they are, a senator can't really afford to just cash out and risk starving his family.""
 ""Boss Thurmond always says there are tons of immigrants right off the boat who aren't afraid to serve a six-year term in elected office hauling out the coal,"" said Sen. Russell ""Rusty"" Feingold (D-WI). ""I hate it like poison, but as soon as we get the slag out of that drift, I know I'm back to the shaft again.""
 In a nationally televised address Tuesday, President Bush paid tribute to the lost senators.
 ""We pray for the souls of each of these brave men, and we humbly thank them for toiling to provide our nation with badly needed laws and coal,"" Bush said. ""We are with their families in their time of grief and promise a full congressional investigation just as soon as the mine–and Congress itself–can be reconstructed.""

"This so-called ""igloo"" of ours, dear, is a complete embarrassment. Some days, I don't even want to be seen crawling out of the entrance. Now, the Meekitjuks next door, they've got a beautiful place–perfectly cut blocks of ice, a nice, wide entrance, and a two-sled snow rampart built into the back. Why can't we live in a decent igloo like them?
 Just take a look at this poor excuse for an igloo: there are ice shavings all over the floor, the ceiling is filthy with smoke, and the wall that faces the rising sun is so uneven, it looks like it's ready to cave in at any second. I wouldn't be surprised if we came home one day to find the whole dome collapsed! Yes, we're the laughingstock of the whole neighborhood.
 Yesterday, I had some of the gals from the neighborhood over for a bit of blood soup. I didn't even have a decent hammered-copper bowl to serve it in. On top of that, do you think they didn't notice the worn-out condition of our qipiik? It's more hole than caribou hide! And this old polar-bear-skin rug–it's an ancient hand-me-down from my grandmother, and we're still using it.
 All the other women in the village enjoy the latest modern conveniences: blades made of metal, coffee cans to cure the blubber dip. Meanwhile, I don't have so much as an   knife to butcher the darn seals.
 Not that I've had much to butcher lately. Yesterday, I was peeking out the front entrance and saw Pauloosie Meekitjuk come home after a day of hunting. He was dragging two seals home on his sled! When was the last time   brought two seals home? Last week, it was a few skinny little otters. You're always giving the same lame excuse, telling me it's a ""hard winter."" Well, we must have some real strange weather patterns around these parts, because it doesn't seem to be a hard winter 20 feet away over at Chez Meekitjuk.
 You come home every night, complaining about how exhausted you are from standing over the ice all day with a harpoon, waiting for a seal to surface. And that's not even counting all the nights you come crawling in the front hole at 2 a.m., armed with some phony-baloney story about how you've been out all night following caribou tracks across the frozen tundra. Please. I'm not stupid. I know you're down at the kashgee listening to the shaman stories with the guys. And you know what? I'm really starting to get tired of it.
 This coming Sunday, we're invited to the seal-sharing feast over at the Meekitjuks. You'll be happy to know that there will be a whole feast of sliced flipper and blubber and caribou-stomach contents. And I'm sure you'll enjoy it every bit as much as the Meekitjuks' last feast. But we're not going to be invited too many more times if you don't bring home a seal soon to return the favor. Then where will we be? We'll be shunned and have to move our igloo to the bad part of the village, out where the anthropologists live.
 I know what you're thinking: ""But Komangapik! We just got a new kayak this year! Doesn't that count for something?"" Some kayak! The Meekitjuks have a 14-foot kayak, and ours is barely 10 feet long. And what about the caribou-skin interior you keep saying you'll put in it as soon as you get the time? You promised to do it 20 moons ago!
 The only thing you care about is that stupid sled of yours. Did we really need another dog? I think Qallunaaq and Kitikmeot were more than adequate, but you insisted we needed Nujuattaittut and Nujuattaittuttuta, too.
 My mother warned me about you. She said, ""Komangapik, that man has the spirit of the mighty humpback whale in his soul, but nothing but dust in the pockets of his parka."" What did I know? I was only 14. Now that I'm older, I understand all too well what she was saying.
 Don't I deserve a decent igloo? Do you think I just sit around all day chewing dried salmon while you're away hunting? Yesterday, I spent all day repairing last year's sealskin boots with sinew thread and bone needles, just so I'd have something decent to wear to storytelling sessions around the group fire. If only I could have something besides the same old fox-fur coats.
 You spare no expense when it comes to your precious harpoons and knives. You just had to have that toggle harpoon made out of ivory when the antler one would have done fine. But as soon as I want a few small things for around the igloo, we suddenly don't have the skins to trade for them.
 Did you see the wooden mask Amik Meekitjuk has on her wall? I asked her where she got it. She said she bought it during an umiak trip to Baffin Island and that it cost only a pot of seal oil.  ! We barely have enough seal oil to keep our igloo lit through the winter, and they're trading away a whole pot of oil! The fact that she got it during a trip to Baffin Island only makes it worse. Every year, you promise that the whole family will migrate there for the summer to fish and capture birds. Then, when it's time to go, you take off with the other men and say there's not enough room in the umiak for me and the kids.
 Do you think I enjoy sitting home, staring at the same one wall day after day? Of course not! Then, when I offer to accompany you on the hunt, you say I talk too much and prevent the seals from coming to the surface! Well, maybe if I had more otter to skin, I'd have less time to talk. Hmmph.

"VATICAN CITY–As the health of Pope John Paul II erodes and, with it, the next papal election draws near, many Catholic Church officials have expressed dismay over the prevalence of negative campaigning among those vying for Catholicism's top post.
 ""This papal campaign is one of the nastiest in recent memory, characterized by slander, smear tactics, and ad hominem attacks,"" said   editor Bruno DeGaetano. ""Everyone knows His Holiness will soon be called to join The Heavenly Father, and there are a lot of cardinals out there who've been waiting since 1978 to run for pope, so the stakes are incredibly high.""
 The papal election, expected to occur in late 2001 or early 2002, has already sparked a flurry of negative campaign ads on TV.
 ""Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera has been archbishop of Mexico City since 1995,"" says the voiceover of one ad currently airing in North America. ""But in that time, he twice opposed the canonization of Our Lady of Guadalupe, one of Mexico's most beloved religious figures. If Our Lady isn't fit to be a saint, Cardinal Carrera, who is?"" The image of Cardinal Carrera is then shown superimposed over a shadowy image of a horned, fork-tailed man holding a pitchfork.
 The ad was paid for by the Committee To Elect Pope Egan, an organization that supports New York Archbishop Edward Egan.
 ""This is absurd,"" Carrera said. ""I never opposed the canonization of Our Lady of Guadalupe. I merely noted that several others were at least as deserving. I'd also like to note that it's more than a little ironic that Cardinal Egan, a known consort of moneylenders and fraternizer with sodomites, should take the moral high ground against a man with a proven track record of piety like myself.""
 Egan, who recently hired longtime Bill Clinton advisor Dick Morris as a consultant, denied involvement with the ads or the Committee To Elect Pope Egan.
 ""In the past six months, various advocacy groups, nominally in the pay of my opponents, have questioned my stance on drugs, birth control, and creationism,"" said Cardinal Antonio Innocenti, Archbishop of Eclano, speaking to various assembled cardinals in St. Peter's Basilica. ""I resent that we must stoop to such secular levels in our quest for the papacy, and I promise that if it pleases God that I am chosen, I shall issue a papal edict banning such behavior.""
 Cardinal Innocenti's campaign promise isn't the only one stirring controversy in the Vatican. Archbishop Emeritus Giovanni Canestri of Genoa was recently slammed for promising to reduce confessional penances for all Catholics by at least 10 Hail Marys, 10 Novenas, and 5 Our Fathers by 2004. And, in a controversial interview in the March issue of the German magazine  , Archbishop Joachim Meisner of Cologne stated that, if elected pope, he would loosen the definition of a ""viable fetus,"" allowing abortions for Catholics well into the second trimester. In the weeks since the interview's publication, Archbishop Meisner's approval rating among Catholics has doubled, prompting outrage from lesser-known cardinals.
 ""The backstabbing among these holy men has grown fierce,"" United Catholic League president Frank Donovan said. ""Take Ash Wednesday just a few weeks ago. Cardinal Claudio Hummes was presiding over a live televised mass in São Paulo when, right in the middle of the recounting of the Third Station of the Cross, an unidentified man in the crowd repeatedly yelled for Hummes to 'tell them about the shame of Sister Maria.' Then the man started screaming that sodomy is a mortal sin and that he 'had pictures.' It created quite a stir, particularly when Hummes lost his temper and denied knowing any Sister Maria. After the man was apprehended and questioned, he said that a man in a red hat had promised him liquor if he yelled those things within earshot of reporters.""
 Other recent examples of dirty tactics include a doctored photo of Cardinal Honore appearing to drop a premature infant at a Tours clinic, the infamous ""Do we really want a Pope Darmaatmadja?"" TV spots, and the anti-Archbishop of Canterbury newspaper ads funded by ""the Friends of Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning of Glasgow,"" a nonexistent organization subsequently revealed to be a front for Desmond Connell, the Archbishop of Dublin.
 Despite all the negative campaigning, Pope John Paul II expressed confidence that cooler heads will prevail when the process of choosing his successor begins.
 ""Back in 1978, when Pope Paul VI fell ill, I went out of my way to expose Cardinal Albino Luciani's drinking problem and predilection for impure thoughts to the Vatican Council,"" His Holiness told reporters. ""But despite such attacks, I lost the election. Later that year, the new pope died and I was in the running once again, this time determined to run a clean race. I did, and I won. I have faith that, as I did, today's papal candidates will eventually see the wisdom of eschewing slander and sticking to the issues that matter to everyday Catholics.""

"MINNETONKA, MN—Saying he had witnessed up close the daily hardships endured by a young person impaired by a bland, unremarkable appearance, local doctor Daniel Barrett told reporters Wednesday how growing up with an average-looking brother inspired him to become a cosmetic surgeon. “As a boy, I saw how my kid brother Kevin was held back every day by his mediocre looks, and I always wished I could do something to help him,” said Barrett, describing his sibling’s battle to overcome the commonplace, forgettable face he was born with. “He tried to be strong—you could see that he wanted to be just like the other, more attractive kids, but he was routinely ostracized. He knew that he was different, that he wasn’t particularly appealing physically, and he always had to work so much harder because of that. It’s heartbreaking to watch someone you love struggle with aesthetic imperfections, and that’s what made me dedicate my life to helping those who are similarly ordinary-looking.” “No one should have to go through life without highly symmetrical facial features,” he added. “No one.” Barrett stated that his brother suffered a difficult childhood, never developing the flawless complexion or well-defined bone structure of better-looking youths. Looking on helplessly one day as Kevin tried and failed to get the attention of an attractive girl at their high school, Barrett said he suddenly realized what kind of help his brother needed: an implant to fix his weak chin, a chemical peel to smooth over his skin blemishes, and an abdominoplasty to remove unsightly layers of excess skin and fat from his midsection. According to Barrett, at that very moment he chose to devote himself to eliminating such cosmetic shortcomings by pursuing a life of plastic surgery, laser skin resurfacing, and liposuction. Barrett remarked that throughout his long years of medical training, whenever he encountered adversity during his studies or was plagued by personal doubts, he would often picture Kevin’s slight, undistinguished jawline and poorly proportioned ears to remind himself of the many people like his brother who were crippled by a plain appearance and in need of his assistance. Now a practicing surgeon, Barrett is credited with saving hundreds of patients from unbalanced noses and thin, shapeless lips. “It’s not an easy job, but when I start to feel overwhelmed by the pressure, I just look at the photo of my little brother that I keep on my desk and remember what all this is for,” said Barrett, gesturing to a framed photograph of Kevin that he says provides him with motivation every morning when he arrives at his office. “You see this smile? When I’m performing a facelift or a cheek augmentation, I think of this smile, and how just one collagen injection could soften the fine lines and wrinkles around it.” “Some people get into this profession for the money or the prestige, but for me it’s a far more personal matter,” Barrett continued. “I do it for Kevin and all the jowled, snub-nosed people out there like him.” Citing Kevin’s sagging brow line and dark under-eye circles as reminders of the many challenges faced by those with aesthetic deficits, Barrett admitted he often finds himself wondering how things might have been different if his brother had received proper treatment for his condition. It is his hope, he said, to give young people who are not particularly attractive the kinds of opportunities Kevin never had. “Imagine what it must be like for the kid who dreads picture day at school and who will never go to prom with a popular girl because he lacks sharply chiseled features,” Barrett said. “I want to help that kid overcome his adversity.” “If I can use the craft of cosmetic surgery to allow just one 15-year-old to walk out of here with rejuvenated facial skin and alluringly reshaped eyelids,” he continued, “I’ll know I’ve made a difference.” ",1,Doctor Recalls Average-Looking Sibling Who Inspired Him To Go Into Cosmetic Surgery
"This so-called ""igloo"" of ours, dear, is a complete embarrassment. Some days, I don't even want to be seen crawling out of the entrance. Now, the Meekitjuks next door, they've got a beautiful place—perfectly cut blocks of ice, a nice, wide entrance, and a two-sled snow rampart built into the back. Why can't we live in a decent igloo like them? Just take a look at this poor excuse for an igloo: there are ice shavings all over the floor, the ceiling is filthy with smoke, and the wall that faces the rising sun is so uneven, it looks like it's ready to cave in at any second. I wouldn't be surprised if we came home one day to find the whole dome collapsed! Yes, we're the laughingstock of the whole neighborhood.  Yesterday, I had some of the gals from the neighborhood over for a bit of blood soup. I didn't even have a decent hammered-copper bowl to serve it in. On top of that, do you think they didn't notice the worn-out condition of our qipiik? It's more hole than caribou hide! And this old polar-bear-skin rug—it's an ancient hand-me-down from my grandmother, and we're still using it. All the other women in the village enjoy the latest modern conveniences: blades made of metal, coffee cans to cure the blubber dip. Meanwhile, I don't have so much as an   knife to butcher the darn seals. Not that I've had much to butcher lately. Yesterday, I was peeking out the front entrance and saw Pauloosie Meekitjuk come home after a day of hunting. He was dragging two seals home on his sled! When was the last time   brought two seals home? Last week, it was a few skinny little otters. You're always giving the same lame excuse, telling me it's a ""hard winter."" Well, we must have some real strange weather patterns around these parts, because it doesn't seem to be a hard winter 20 feet away over at Chez Meekitjuk. You come home every night, complaining about how exhausted you are from standing over the ice all day with a harpoon, waiting for a seal to surface. And that's not even counting all the nights you come crawling in the front hole at 2 a.m., armed with some phony-baloney story about how you've been out all night following caribou tracks across the frozen tundra. Please. I'm not stupid. I know you're down at the kashgee listening to the shaman stories with the guys. And you know what? I'm really starting to get tired of it. This coming Sunday, we're invited to the seal-sharing feast over at the Meekitjuks. You'll be happy to know that there will be a whole feast of sliced flipper and blubber and caribou-stomach contents. And I'm sure you'll enjoy it every bit as much as the Meekitjuks' last feast. But we're not going to be invited too many more times if you don't bring home a seal soon to return the favor. Then where will we be? We'll be shunned and have to move our igloo to the bad part of the village, out where the anthropologists live.  I know what you're thinking: ""But Komangapik! We just got a new kayak this year! Doesn't that count for something?"" Some kayak! The Meekitjuks have a 14-foot kayak, and ours is barely 10 feet long. And what about the caribou-skin interior you keep saying you'll put in it as soon as you get the time? You promised to do it 20 moons ago! The only thing you care about is that stupid sled of yours. Did we really need another dog? I think Qallunaaq and Kitikmeot were more than adequate, but you insisted we needed Nujuattaittut and Nujuattaittuttuta, too. My mother warned me about you. She said, ""Komangapik, that man has the spirit of the mighty humpback whale in his soul, but nothing but dust in the pockets of his parka."" What did I know? I was only 14. Now that I'm older, I understand all too well what she was saying. Don't I deserve a decent igloo? Do you think I just sit around all day chewing dried salmon while you're away hunting? Yesterday, I spent all day repairing last year's sealskin boots with sinew thread and bone needles, just so I'd have something decent to wear to storytelling sessions around the group fire. If only I could have something besides the same old fox-fur coats. You spare no expense when it comes to your precious harpoons and knives. You just had to have that toggle harpoon made out of ivory when the antler one would have done fine. But as soon as I want a few small things for around the igloo, we suddenly don't have the skins to trade for them. Did you see the wooden mask Amik Meekitjuk has on her wall? I asked her where she got it. She said she bought it during an umiak trip to Baffin Island and that it cost only a pot of seal oil.  ! We barely have enough seal oil to keep our igloo lit through the winter, and they're trading away a whole pot of oil! The fact that she got it during a trip to Baffin Island only makes it worse. Every year, you promise that the whole family will migrate there for the summer to fish and capture birds. Then, when it's time to go, you take off with the other men and say there's not enough room in the umiak for me and the kids.  Do you think I enjoy sitting home, staring at the same one wall day after day? Of course not! Then, when I offer to accompany you on the hunt, you say I talk too much and prevent the seals from coming to the surface! Well, maybe if I had more otter to skin, I'd have less time to talk. Hmmph.

"SCARSDALE, NY—Local couple Alison Fry and Peter Hartman told reporters Thursday they have both been pleased since opening up their relationship, saying the exciting new arrangement allowed them the freedom to psychologically wear down other people. “We decided that, at this point, we’re both comfortable enough with each other that we can go outside of the relationship and explore making someone else completely miserable, all while knowing that the two of us are the ones we truly care about devastating emotionally,” Fry explained of the agreement, which allows her and Hartman to guiltlessly seek out additional partners and burden them with their insecurities. “At first, I wasn’t sure if overwhelming other people with our respective selfishness and emotional neediness was for us. But now that we’ve started, it’s actually really liberating to know that while we can mentally drain others on the side, there will always be that deep, strained emotional tension between Peter and I that we will always return to. It’s been really great.” Fry added that if the arrangement worked out well, the couple may consider having a three-way screaming argument.

"MARFA, TX—Employees at Gillman’s Hardware confirmed Monday that despite the company’s small size, single location, and the fact that it has been family owned and operated for over 35 years, it still manages to treat its staff as if they worked at a faceless multinational chain. “Sure, there are only 15 or so employees here, but our supervisors really make us feel like we’re completely valueless and replaceable,” said sales associate Alex Waverly, 27, citing touches like a lack of health benefits, the expectation that he stay late stacking bags of mulch without collecting overtime, and the prohibition against sitting on the sample deck chairs or anywhere else at any point during his six-hour shifts. “It’s a local hardware store; you don’t expect cold, corporate practices like getting patted down whenever you leave for lunch to ensure you haven’t shoplifted, or not earning a single cent above minimum wage, but somehow they’re able to foster that kind of environment.” Waverly added that it was also nice to see the store sticking to its philosophy by holding onto every last dollar earned, rather than investing any of it back into the community.

"OVERLAND PARK, KS—Saying that spontaneity is key to spicing up a marriage, local couple Dale and Barbara Patterson told reporters Wednesday they’ve kept their relationship interesting over the years by bickering in a variety of different positions and even different rooms. “Sometimes we’ll look directly into each other’s eyes when we’re having arguments, and other times she’ll turn away from me and I’ll scream at her from behind,” said Dale Patterson, 37, who told reporters that the couple resolved to shake things up a bit when their angry exchanges grew stale after 12 years of marriage. “We’ll pounce on each other the second we get home from work in the evening, and if we wake up in the mood we’ll go at it again in the morning.” “We moved into a new house just a few months ago, and I swear we’ve already gotten into it in every room, not to mention the basement, the garage, the backyard shed—you name it,” he added. According to Barbara Patterson, 38, she and her husband used to only antagonize each other once a month at most—always in the bedroom, always in the same routine manner. Usually, she said, Dale would finish screaming first, and before she had time to get in a last word, he would just let out a groan, roll over, and go to sleep. “Our fighting used to be completely passionless and predictable, but now we bicker at a moment’s notice whenever we feel the mood coming over us,” said Barbara Patterson, who confirmed she recently marched into her husband’s office, slammed the door, swept everything off his desk, and “went to town on him.” “Sometimes we’ll keep at it all night. Last Friday, we had arguments at least five times before we both collapsed, completely exhausted.” “Just yesterday we exchanged one hot-blooded glance during the kids’ swimming lessons, and before I knew it we were having a quickie shouting match right in the hallway outside,” she added. Dale Patterson confirmed to reporters that his wife is not shy about bickering while other people could be listening or even watching, and in fact “gets pretty worked up” when the couple has arguments in public. He confirmed that at Christmas dinner last year, Barbara angrily stood up from their dining room table and stormed into the kitchen, where he soon joined her and the two “just tore into each other” right then and there. Admitting that at times their disputes can get fairly wild and uninhibited, Barbara recalled how during the car ride home from a particularly tense visit with her in-laws, she surprised her husband by giving him a piece of her mind while he was driving. Things grew heated very quickly, she said, and her impulsive act nearly caused Dale to swerve off the road. The couple also stated that modern technology has allowed them to provoke each other even while Dale is away on business trips. “The tension builds up all day and by the time I get on Skype with Dale, I’m ready to explode,” Barbara said. “I just get all flushed and I admit I can get pretty loud. When we’re really going at it, I just want to throw that man around the room.” “And when he gets home, I do,” she added. “Believe me, I give it to him good.” ",1,"Couple Keeps It Interesting By Bickering In Different Positions, Rooms"

"WASHINGTON—The nation remained in a state of fear and panic this afternoon, following confirmed reports that hundreds of millions of Americans—nearly the entire population of the country—had fully and inexplicably lost consciousness for eight hours last night. Places of business were shuttered and communication systems overwhelmed as Americans, emerging from disoriented hazes this morning, stayed huddled in their homes and frantically sought to contact loved ones following the bizarre mass event. All across the country, unnerved citizens reportedly turned to their friends, neighbors, and even strangers for comfort as they sought to help each other comprehend and regroup from the perplexing circumstances that left them debilitated and entirely insensate for roughly a third of a day, while government officials have scrambled to address the crisis and urge calm among Americans. “While we are still actively gathering information on the events of last night, we can definitively state that for a period of between roughly six and nine hours, nearly every U.S. resident was completely immobilized and unconscious,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney in a hastily called press conference today, noting that even the highest-ranking members of the government, including President Obama and top officials in Congress and the Pentagon, fell victim to the perplexing phenomenon. “As a precaution, the president has mobilized FEMA, CDC containment teams, as well as our armed forces, because for all we know, this could very well happen again.” “For the time being, we ask Americans to calmly shelter in place,” Carney added. “And if you see any fellow citizen falling back into this same incapacitated state, we urge you to do whatever you can to revive them.” Based on thousands of citizens’ reports, the mass debilitation affected people of all ages, races, and genders in every town and city across the country. Though no definitive explanation for the occurrence has yet been reached, dozens of theories have been put forward by scientists and civilians alike, ranging from an airborne toxin, to a powerful shift in the earth’s natural magnetic force, to a terrorist attack, to an act of an angered God. Regardless of cause, nearly every American interviewed relayed a similar story of the incident’s onset, recalling that at some point last night, they began to notice an alarming slowing of their mental faculties and a growing sensation of full-body fatigue. Sources said that as it progressed, the bizarre phenomenon left them struggling to keep their eyes open, even if they were actively watching a television show or reading a book, until eventually their bodies and minds, in their words, simply “turned off.” Most citizens stated that the next thing they were aware of was finding themselves in the same exact location hours later with absolutely no memory of the preceding interval, with some individuals reporting feelings of sluggishness and confusion so acute that they momentarily had trouble recognizing their surroundings or recalling what day it was. Additionally, subsets of those affected described a strange, gritty crust forming around the edges of their eyes or a mysterious trace of saliva dried on their chin, apparently remnants of the unsettling catatonic state. According to unsubstantiated reports, certain individuals may even have experienced a similar loss of consciousness later in the day for a period of up to 30 minutes. “When I first regained my senses and found myself just lying there in my home, I thought it was something that had only happened to me,” said Omaha, NE resident Andrew Calhoun, noting that he immediately checked himself to make sure he was unhurt. “Then I noticed my wife and kids rubbing their eyes and groaning slightly as if they were emerging from a heavy sedation, too. I’ve never been so terrified.” “It’s horrifying to think we were all just sprawled on our backs, completely motionless for literally hours,” Calhoun continued. “We had no sense of sight or hearing, no idea what was going on around us—it’s like we just lost those eight hours completely. It’s crazy.” While most citizens reported having no memory whatsoever from the incident, a sizable percentage of the populace claimed to have been plagued by mysterious visions, with many such individuals recalling strange and sometimes terrifying scenes in vivid detail. “I swear, while I was passed out, I had the most unsettling hallucination in which I, my boss, and an old friend from summer camp were all at my old childhood home—can you believe that?” said Seattle woman Valerie McComb, who appeared visibly shaken as she recounted the details. “And then at one point, and this is the most frightening part, my teeth just all fell out. How am I supposed to move on after such a horrific vision? Could it be an omen foretelling the future? Am I supposed to follow its instructions? I don’t know.” At press time, streets across the U.S. were deserted and American life remained at a standstill, as most citizens were reportedly huddling at home with their loved ones in fear that the baffling occurrence might strike again. However, at least a small portion of the populace expressed their openness to experiencing the phenomenon again. “Of course it was incredibly strange to black out for so long, but as weird as it sounds, I actually kind of enjoyed being in that vulnerable, incapacitated state,” 33-year-old Jacob Pressentein of Glen Ellyn, IL said. “In a way, I almost felt like I was in a more peaceful place. I actually thought it felt kind of pleasant.” “And if I’m being honest,” he added, “I kind of wish I were back in that state right now.” ",1,Nation Terrified After Millions Lose Consciousness For 8 Whole Hours Last Night
"PHILADELPHIA—Though 48 years old and employed full time waiting tables at a New American bistro, local man Phillip Ames sadly does not spend his downtime working on any creative side projects, sources reported Thursday. “When Phil first started, I’d have guessed he was in a blues band or trying to write a screenplay or a collection of poems or something—you know, something that necessitated having a day job,” said coworker Devin Healey, 23. “But once I got to know him a little better and asked what he likes to do when he’s not working, he just said, ‘hang out and enjoy my time off.’” “And I thought, ‘ ,’” Healey continued. “You’d think he’d at least be recording an album or contributing to an obscure literary journal.  .” According to confounded sources, Ames apparently lives in an apartment that contains neither an easel nor a writing nook and spends his time at work exclusively focused on the task of being a waiter. The paunchy, slightly balding man’s daily routine of frantically hustling around a restaurant to take orders, clear tables, and deliver food is unfortunately not being used as fodder for any creative ideas he’s developing on the side. In fact, sources reported that on days when Ames is not working, the nearly 50-year-old server prefers to dedicate his free time to activities such as watching TV, going for walks around his neighborhood, or playing cards with friends. “As sad as it sounds, he’s not going home every night and nursing some artistic passion he keeps hidden from the rest of us,” said Healey, who initially thought the Moleskine notebook Ames kept in his back pocket was his sketchbook, but was later disappointed to learn Ames just used it to remember the specials. “This is his full-time occupation. He’s not into drawing comic strips or writing song lyrics. Not in an improv group. He doesn’t have a recurring slot at a stand-up showcase, none of that.” “I guess when someone asks what he does for a living, he doesn’t say ‘I’m a waiter but I’m also working on a book’ or anything,” Healey added. “He just says, ‘I’m a waiter,’ and that’s that.” Coworkers said that while they could see how Ames might not have an artistic endeavor that takes up all of his free time, they were surprised to discover that he doesn’t so much as have a single pet project he messes around with here and there, jotting down notes on stray napkins or coasters when things are slow at the restaurant and typing them up when he gets home. Furthermore, sources confirmed, Ames did not take the job for its flexible hours that could accommodate an irregular practice schedule, nor is he hoping to quit some day once he “makes it big.” “I thought maybe he’d let me read one of the things he’s working on, but when I asked him he didn’t have a clue what I was talking about,” said fellow waiter Erica Vasquez, adding that Ames was completely puzzled by her offer to provide notes on his work. “I don’t know, I just naturally assumed he’d have an early draft of a novel or one-act play to show me.” At press time, Ames told reporters it was heartbreaking that his coworkers were still so delusional despite already being in their early twenties.

"LAWRENCE, KS—Citing a range of factors from the lack of security glass to the fact that the cash register is situated right next to the front door, a report published Thursday confirmed that robbing the BP gas station at Reynolds and Murray wouldn’t actually be all that hard. “Given that the place is open 24 hours and there’s only ever one guy working behind the counter at night, all you’d have to do is hang around until there are no other customers in there and then sharply tell the cashier you have a gun, and you could probably take that place for all the money in its till without any problem at all,” read the 40-page report, which noted that, even if the cashier triggered a silent alarm, the nearest police station is on the other side of town and it’s not like you couldn’t just run out the door at the first sound of sirens anyway. “Really, if you just left your car running, waved a knife around a little bit, and held open a bag for the cashier to stuff money into, you could be in and out of there in 45 seconds, easy. Nothing really stopping you from grabbing a dozen cartons of cigarettes and a roll of scratch-off tickets on the way out either.” The report went on to speculate that if Carl was working the graveyard shift, a prospective thief could probably just drag the whole ATM into a waiting pickup truck, no problem.

"OAK BROOK, IL—While making scant reference to any specific products or prices, a bizarre new McDonald’s advertisement that began airing nationwide this week posits to viewers that beef is perhaps a symbolic expression of lust in its most wanton and depraved form. “Would you yourself deny beef?

The flesh calls for you; it implores you to fill your mouth with beef,” the commercial’s narrator asks over grainy, rapidly shifting images of raw ground beef, masticated hamburger, livestock, a fornicating couple, and static. “When we call for beef, what are we really asking for? Is it the caress of a gentle lover? Or the blade of an executioner; the rage of steel on bone?” Representatives for McDonald’s say they have bought extensive primetime space for the ad on all major television networks and will continue to air it through 2014.

"WASHINGTON—According to a report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, a steadily increasing number of weak, emasculated men—if you can still even call them men—are choosing to forego a career and stay at home to raise their children. “Our research shows that thousands of American men—all of whom are pitifully frail and impotent—are leaving the workforce to debase themselves by preparing lunches and tending to their children, ultimately rejecting their role as the family breadwinner in favor of what is effectively gender reassignment,” said head researcher Paul Lopez, noting that the growing ranks of meek, delicate little husbands and fathers often spent their entire days embarrassing themselves and their sex by cleaning, shopping for groceries, and in some extreme cases, folding laundry. “While their anatomy would suggest that, yes, in purely biological terms these are males, their wholesale renunciation of their masculinity has relegated them to the status of subservient, ineffectual nothings who might as well be castrated since that is what they clearly desire anyway.” The report also described a correlated trend of repellent, overly aggressive, testosterone-crazed mothers flooding the corporate world.

"PRINCETON, NJ—The universe, long known as a bleak and unforgiving place where essentially nothing matters, is in fact even crueler and more heartless than previously thought, according to a startling report published Tuesday by scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study. “That the world we inhabit is brutal, cold, and meaningless has of course been established scientific fact for quite some time,” said Dr. Susan Doname, head of the research team that conducted the comprehensive five-year study. “But shockingly, our most recent findings indicate that the brutality, coldness, and meaninglessness are far, far more extreme than we ever realized.” “In fact, the utter futility of it all is a staggering 1.43 million times worse than predicted by our earlier estimates,” she added. The report explains that when it comes to measuring the complete purposelessness of existence, such impossible-to-reconcile-with-a-caring-God phenomena as earthquakes, disease, famine, and basic human cruelty are “small potatoes, really.” It goes on to state that research in the field has long underestimated the grim discoveries of the past century: threats such as global thermonuclear war, manmade super flus, total environmental collapse, an entirely random meteor strike wiping out all life in a single blow, and so on. According to the latest statistics, the universe has up to 71 percent less redemption and 87 percent less forgiveness than was once thought, along with an IBK (Indicators of Basic Kindness) rating that has dropped by 52 percent. At the same time, the universe’s general indifference to suffering of all kinds is about a third higher than originally calculated. Complicating matters is new data that indicates love, often cited as the key mitigating factor against the inevitability of existential gloom, lacks the transcendent power it was once believed to have. “We used to think love had a very major role to play in shaping the universe,” Doname said. “It turns out we were way off on that one. We now more fully understand that everyone and everything a human being loves will one day cease to be, having existed as little more than the smallest of blips in the vast expanse of the cosmos.” “Though to be fair, even that description overstates the case,” she continued. “Whereas we used to believe life on earth constituted but the tiniest imaginable speck in the history of the universe, this latest research shows that it’s not even a speck. It’s not anything at all, really. Statistically speaking, it’s nothing.” The study also reportedly provides the first definitive evidence that there is absolutely no universal creative force that binds existence together, that we are all horribly alone in this place, and that the reason no one has ever been able to find any true meaning in life is because there is none there to be found. The scientists acknowledged their research “unfortunately leaves the human soul vastly fewer resources with which to sustain itself,” and apologized for earlier miscalculations that may have left people with the smallest bit of hope, however false. But they stood by their findings, stating that the entire natural order of things “is just a whole lot crueler than we ever thought possible.” While the groundbreaking discovery has reportedly served as a source of great despair for many members of the human race, others reached for comment seemed to take the news more or less in stride. “I just spent the past 18 hours sewing labels onto brand-name sports apparel,” said Lau Mei-Yee, a 33-year-old garment worker in China’s Guangdong province. “Please stop asking me questions so I can collect my $3.60 in wages, go back to the dormitory I share with eight other people, and get some sleep before my next shift.” ",1,"Universe Crueler, More Uncaring Place Than Previously Thought"
"BATTLE CREEK, MI—In what had originally been intended as a brisk, businesslike trip to the urinal, Calhoun County executive hopeful Phil Hecht spent seven minutes working the Battle Creek Sheraton men's bathroom Monday.
 ""That politician guy didn't seem to realize how weird it was in there,"" said David Muntz, a local orthodontist. ""I don't know… It was like he couldn't turn it off."" 
 ""I had to wash up an extra time after he glad-handed me,"" Muntz added. 
 Hecht's unplanned bathroom tour took place several minutes after his remarks at the Battle Creek Rotary Club's annual Unsung Heroes luncheon, held this year in honor of Jefferson Middle School principal Phyllis DeVreaux. Observers speculated that Hecht ""got carried away"" by both the generous applause following his address and the large number of people in the men's restroom.
 ""When he came toward me, I was in line for the urinal,"" said Aaron Barker, a local bank executive. ""At first, I had no idea what was going on. I didn't know if he wanted to get to the mirror, or what.""
  ""He must not have had to go too bad, because he kept letting people skip him in line,"" Barker added. ""He really got on a roll, there.""
 After individually greeting each person waiting for the urinals, Hecht moved on to the sinks.
 ""He's a real live wire, that Phil Hecht,"" said Tate's Tavern owner Alan Tate, who met the county-executive hopeful beside the paper-towel dispensers. ""He came up to me, introduced himself, and said, 'I care deeply about maternity-leave issues… Wait, who'm I kidding? It's just us guys in here. Hey! Put 'er there.'""
 Many others said they were confused by Hecht's restroom schmoozing.
 ""I had just come out of the stall, but I really didn't expect Hecht to make a joke about it,"" said Werner Neumar, who was approached by Hecht as he attempted to pump liquid soap from an empty dispenser. ""He kept saying 'Get a   of this guy' to [County Democratic Chairman] Frank [Willison], and belly laughing. And then he said I should do a fundraiser for him, like I'm his best friend all of a sudden."" 
 ""That guy gives me the creeps,"" Neumar added.
 Hecht made light of the illustrated instructions on the bathroom's air dryers, saying they demonstrated the lack of focus on basic reading skills in county schools. While his comments provoked nervous laughter among some in the bathroom, school-board member Travis Keyes was not amused.
 ""Reading scores have gone up three out of the past four years,"" Keyes said. ""[Hecht] was just going for the cheap laughs, grandstanding for votes."" 
 Added Keyes: ""Plus, he wasn't even rubbing his hands like the instructions showed. He was just shaking them, and then he had to wipe them on his pants, because they weren't dry.""
 Monday was not the first time Hecht has campaigned in what some might deem an inappropriate place. Last week, he was ejected from a high-school softball game after handing out literature from row to row in the bleachers. In May, he was criticized for stationing himself outside of a church and buttonholing potential voters as they left a funeral.
 Hecht defended his aggressive campaign style. 
 ""I'm unorthodox, but I think Calhoun County needs an executive who doesn't settle for politics as usual,"" Hecht told a reporter. ""What would you rather have—a guy who never takes a break from serving his constituents, not even a bathroom break, or a two-term do-nothing freeloader who sits in his office all day planning his summer vacation?"" 
 ""Let me give you a refrigerator magnet,"" Hecht added. ""And here's one for your freezer. It's got my whole platform, right on it."" ",1,Politician Awkwardly Works The Bathroom
"WASHINGTON—The FBI is asking any Americans with information about the eating habits, top speed, fighting abilities, or other general-interest knowledge of cheetahs to contact them immediately in return for a $1 million reward. “Cheetahs seem really awesome, and we know there are Americans out there who can help us figure out if a cheetah would win in a 100-meter race against a 1998 Yamaha Virago,” said FBI Director Robert Mueller, who paused to ask reporters several times during the course of his statement whether they knew if a cheetah would be able to beat a water buffalo in a fight. “Like, if it really wanted to, could a cheetah cut down a tree with its claws? That would be so fucking sweet.” The FBI stressed that finding out more about cheetahs will be the Bureau’s top priority until they know how wide a canyon a cheetah could jump over going full speed with no wind.

"CHICAGO—Days before he was set to relocate to Denver for work, four-year Chicago resident Paul Marsden lamented Wednesday that he never really took the time to detest the city he called home for nearly half a decade. “It’s too bad, but I never got to truly despise Chicago’s eight-month-long winters, or how the CTA takes forever and doesn’t go anywhere you need it to,” Marsden told reporters, regretting that he hadn’t devoted any time to hating how nearly every bar in the city has several giant flatscreen TVs blaring Bulls, Bears, Cubs, White Sox, or Blackhawks games. “Sure, I could go on and on about the noxious cloud of piss and stale vomit that hangs over Wrigleyville, or the faux edginess of Wicker Park, but there are so many other horrible neighborhoods I never got the chance to hate. I guess I always thought there’d be time to appreciate how awful they are.” Marsden then resolved that when he gets to Denver, he’ll start hating his new home as soon as he can.

"CHERRY HILL, NJ—After over seven years of weekly meetings with his psychiatrist, 35-year-old Chris Vaughan told reporters Friday he is thrilled to be just two 45-minute sessions away from completely resolving all of his problems. “Another 80 or 90 minutes in there and I should be all set,” said a smiling Vaughan, adding that he is looking forward to emerging as a fully secure, emotionally balanced individual devoid of any feelings of guilt, anxiety, or depression. “We’ll cover my parents next week, and after that we’ll take care of my trust issues, and then I should be good to go. I can’t wait to have it all wrapped up and be a totally validated and content human.” At press time, Vaughan’s fiancée had just broken off their engagement, delaying the completion of his therapy by another 672 sessions.

"SAN FRANCISCO—Upon coming across the same job posting Monday for a full-time position at a local startup company, an estimated 1,400 people reportedly described the opening as “a perfect fit” for their qualifications, saying it was exactly the opportunity they’ve been waiting for. “I have all the skills they want, my experience matches up—I honestly don’t know if there’s anyone out there better suited for this job than me,” said unemployed man Charles Duncan, echoing the sentiments of 1,400 others, 900 of whom believe their facility with social media and knowledge of web design will definitely make their application “stand out from the rest of the pack.” “This position just makes so much   for me. My résumé and cover letter might not get me the job outright, but once I go in for the interview they’ll see why I’m ideal for it.” Sources later confirmed a family friend of a top executive at the company had already accepted the position, which had been unofficially promised to him long before the job was even posted.

"WASHINGTON—Saying that the rising price of the commodity has begun to “burn their gumlines,” millions of American lunatics admitted this week that they have been struggling to afford adequate amounts of car meat, an essential staple of the lunatic diet. “With the way prices are going up, there’s no way I can keep eating hatchback bologna every day,” said Ames, IA resident Milton Tannhauser, 37, noting that he had already taken out a loan from the television show   just to make ends meet. “Back when this was the greatest solar system in the country, I could buy a bucket of car meat for whatever gravel I had left at the end of the day—convertible chops, Volvo shanks, and those great station wagon sausages that they would deliver straight to the laundry hamper. But now, unless you’re pulling down the salary of a mall pope, it’s just too expensive.” “And what are the Rockefellers doing about it?” Tannhauser added in a much softer tone of voice after guardedly peering to both sides. “Not a goddamn thing. It makes you wonder why we even went to war with the Pep Boys.” Tannhauser’s story is all too common, as lunatics across the country have expressed dismay over the surging prices. Over the past 15 years, wildly unpredictable car meat prices have surged from negative four cents per pound of Jeep belly to a record high of 35 feet of aluminum foil for a single bite of slow-roasted Cadillac, and the completely psychotic are feeling the pinch. According to top lunatic economists, over 4,300 percent of crazy U.S. citizens have had to forego vital expenses from shiny key rings to exactly 10 packages of peppermint Chiclets, just to ensure that they can afford the daily allowance of 17 pounds of car meat recommended by deranged nutritionists. “I have 14 Barbra Streisands to feed, and having to sell my memories on Craigslist just to buy a Chevrolet sandwich isn’t helping,” Miami resident Yank Mutcherson, 793, shouted at a large outdoor concrete flower planter. “The speakers installed in my ear are yelling sunup to sundown about ‘We want Hondaburgers! We want roast minivan!’ But thanks to the big shots at Lysol and Eastman Kodak, I’ve been stuffing less and less dinner into my coat pockets.” Added Mutcherson, “It’s honestly enough to make a guy scream the name ‘Vanna White’ repeatedly until he gets kicked out of the library.” As prices continue to climb, pressure is increasing on insane leaders to address the situation. A march last month on the National Mall in Washington was attended by an estimated four lunatics, who reportedly chanted and waved Halloween decorations as they marched in separate directions. A scathing editorial in the  , the nation’s leading psychotic newspaper printed on used coffee filters, demanded that President Obama stop NASA from harvesting hair from every human while they sleep and instead put more car meat into lunatics’ stomachs and VCRs. Other activists have vowed to stage hunger strikes, marry Melissa Joan Hart, or rip down any sign or placard beginning with the letter N until price controls are put in place. However, help for the hungry and delusional may come in the form of H.R. 614, an aid bill drafted by self-proclaimed congressman Rep. Arnold Thermos. If passed, the bill would allocate $300 million a second for the purpose of distributing free car meat to any citizen who recites the instructions being broadcast by overhead power lines. Funding for the bill would reportedly be raised by relaxing levels of the secret chemical in Mountain Dew that lets the Bureau of Weights and Measures track citizens’ bowel movements. But such aid may be too little, too late for unhinged imbeciles like Jesus Christ of Bloomington, IN. “In 1980 you could get a trolley steak for seven plastic bags, with a discount if Peter Frampton lives in your cigarette lighter,” Christ muttered to a reporter through a sewer grate. “This year my Thanksgiving dinner was a couple of electric scooter patties marinated in church juice. It just goes to know, to go, go, the go you show, whoa, my feet, William.” ",1,Nation’s Lunatics Lament Rising Cost Of Car Meat
"CHICAGO—Saying that he’s probably done all he could possibly do at this point, Twitter user Aaron Gartner confirmed Tuesday that after posting 10,000 tweets and accumulating just 15 followers, the 26-year-old is pretty much ready to pack it in and discontinue his account. “I think I’ve taken this about as far as it can go,” said Gartner, who created @AaronGartner in March 2010 and has gained, on average, a little over four Twitter followers per year since. “I’ll maybe give it a few more months, but yeah, I think I’m about done here.” The 26-year-old stated that despite following 785 accounts, avidly retweeting others’ posts, and making sure to comment on topical events like the blackout during this year’s Super Bowl and Lindsay Lohan’s legal troubles, his account has basically come to the end of the line. Gartner, who plans on hanging it up after receiving no more than three retweets in a given week, confirmed that his posts frequently incorporate popular hashtag-based games and trending topics that at first seemed like surefire ways of increasing his following but ultimately failed to help any of his tweets take off. “Last year, I got on the Kony train pretty early, but I think my voice got lost,” said Gartner, adding that he’s tried to expand his online presence by thinking of tweets using hashtags such as #ShitMyDadSays, #ShitMyMomSays, #Belieber, and #TeaParty. “I think if more people retweeted my stuff instead of just favoriting it I might have gained a little more traction. The problem is nobody really sees favorites.” “A couple days ago I wrote, ‘I’d eat bacon-flavored anything. RT if you agree!’” continued Gartner, whose most recent tweets include, “Um, it’s 2013, are we seriously talking about gay marriage?” “.@ConanOBrien, you ever going to come back to Chicago?” and “Thirsty as hell right now.” “I thought the bacon thing was pretty funny and pretty relatable, but the only response I got was a retweet from my brother. And last year, I did this thing where I tweeted about   for a week straight. Nothing.” Gartner, whose most avid followers consist mainly of his aunt, his roommate, and an unfamiliar Twitter account from Argentina with the profile photo of an egg, told reporters that he got a sense his time was about up when he decided to live-tweet the Golden Globes and actually lost three followers. At one point last year, Gartner said, he was averaging 900 tweets per follower—a statistic that the sales manager admitted was “pretty much the writing on the wall.” According to Gartner, the most Twitter followers he’s ever had at any given moment was 18. “The trouble is people who follow me are friends and family who mostly just follow each other,” Gartner said. “So what usually happens is, I post a tweet, and then even if someone retweets me, it’s just being seen by the same people over and over again.” “You need one of those guys with a checkmark to retweet you so that you can break through a little,” added Gartner, who mentioned that several months ago he “threw a Hail Mary” and tweeted at President Barack Obama in hopes that whomever runs his account might see the post and retweet him. “But the longer it goes on, the longer it seems like that’s never going to happen. At this point, I think I just have to cut my losses.” While Gartner said he never expected to have 500,000 followers, he did think that after three years of tweeting, he’d be able to make some sort of impression and amass at least 500 followers, and definitely more than 20. However, Gartner now reportedly believes it just wasn’t in the cards. “I gave it my best shot, but I think it’s about time to call it a day,” he said. “Maybe I’ll try a couple more tweets and see if any of them strike a vein, but honestly, I think I’ve done what I can here.” At press time, Gartner was reportedly rereading a tweet he posted in November 2012 that received three favorites and two retweets.

"COLUMBUS, OH—In an effort to cater to customers who have lost the will to live, economy hotel chain Red Roof Inn officially unveiled Thursday its new Suicidal Suite available at each of their locations across the nation. The accommodations, available for as low as $59 per night, are said to have been carefully crafted to “flawlessly complement the suicide experience in every way imaginable.” “We’re thrilled to announce the launch of these specialized suites, perfect for anyone who has decided that nothing matters anymore and the time has finally come to just end it all,” said Red Roof Inn hospitality director Jeffrey Connelly. “If you’re feeling despondent or just down in the dumps and you want to treat yourself to a quick and relatively painless death, this is the place for you.” “People have been coming to Red Roof Inn to kill themselves for years, and now we’ve made it easier and more convenient than ever,” added Connelly. According to Connelly, Suicidal Suites are situated on the top floor of Red Roof Inn hotels and provide a panoramic view of a mostly empty parking lot and a desolate freeway. The suite itself reportedly boasts a somber ambiance accented by an all-grey décor and dim fluorescent lighting to “get you in the mood.” The bedroom’s two large casement windows let in virtually no sunlight, open all the way, and are guaranteed, Connelly said, to be “high enough.” “The thin, paint-chipped walls have been engineered specifically to allow you to easily overhear any conversation, laughter, or sexual activity emanating from adjacent rooms,” said Connelly, adding that smoking is indeed permitted in each suite, should a guest desire one last cigarette before finishing the job once and for all. “The single twin bed comes standard with 400-thread cotton sheets—perfect for hanging on one broken ceiling fan and easily capable of supporting over 450 pounds.” “Moreover, feel free to watch the mounted 24-inch television with over 150 channels of pure static,” continued Connelly. “Should you want to take one more cold, hard look at yourself in a dirty mirror before mustering up the courage to actually go through with it, just stroll on into the bathroom. And you can’t go wrong with a long soak in the bathtub, which is of course within comfortable reaching distance of a 240-volt radio.” A stay in the Suicidal Suite reportedly comes with a wide range of hotel amenities ideal for those consumed by severe and debilitating depression, anxiety, or guilt. Connelly explained that the room service menu has a comprehensive selection of last meals available 24 hours a day, while the mini-bar comes fully stocked with bottles of hard liquor and bargain-priced prescription-pill cocktails made from an assortment of Xanax, OxyContin, and Percocet. “We guarantee that anyone staying with us will have total, uninterrupted privacy to take his or her own life,” said Connelly, noting that the rooms feature a small wooden desk upon which guests can scribble a goodbye note to their loved ones. “Simply put the red ‘Do Not Disturb’ hanger on the doorknob, and our staff will know not to come in until the next morning, at which time we will clean up any blood or vomit for no additional charge.” “And if you forget your razor blades at home, simply call down to the front desk and a free set will be delivered to you right away,” Connelly added. Connelly also confirmed that each in-room safe contains a complimentary handgun already loaded with one bullet. In an effort to promote the new suites, Red Roof Inn will reportedly offer a summer weeknight special, during which rates will be reduced to $39. Based on early reviews, however, industry sources said the Suicidal Suites are already on course to become a resounding success. “I’ve only just checked in, but so far the hotel has taken care of everything,” said 34-year-old Dayton, OH resident Matthew Hunne, one of the first guests to stay in one of the suites. “The room has exactly what I need, so I really have no complaints.” “Sorry,” Hunne added while slowly closing his room door. “I have to go now.” ",1,Red Roof Inn Announces New Suicidal Suite

"WASHINGTON—Federal, state, and local law enforcement officials are reportedly on high alert today after a group of dangerous sociopaths entered the chambers of Congress, posing what sources are calling “an extreme risk” to the U.S. federal government and the nation at large. According to authorities, the hundreds of individuals, all of whom have a prior history of sociopathic and harmful behavior, were seen entering the U.S. Capitol Building at approximately 10 a.m. this morning, at which point officers promptly arrived on the scene and secured the area. Citizens in the D.C. area, and across America, are being urged to stay vigilant as officials attempt to ascertain the precise nature of the threat these individuals pose. “While we cannot say at this time what they want, these men and women are ruthless, highly dangerous, and are not to be trusted under any circumstances,” said D.C. police officer Ted Wallerman, who said law enforcement officials would continue to monitor the known sociopaths throughout the day. “Unlike normal human beings such as you or I, these individuals are essentially incapable of experiencing remorse for their actions, so there’s no telling what insane ends they’ll go to in order to satisfy their lust for power.” “Hopefully we can find a way to reason with them and end this situation peaceably,” Wallerman added. “But it’s never easy negotiating with maniacs.” Eyewitnesses say the hundreds of sociopaths entered the building dressed in suits and ties and appearing outwardly calm before converging on the Congressional chambers shortly thereafter, essentially seizing control of the building. D.C. police warned citizens that the sociopaths are experts at manipulation, manifesting a false outward appearance of sanity, and even compassion, but that such behavior was merely a ploy and should be disregarded at all costs. “These are predatory personalities overwhelmed by selfishness and blind, irrational anger—do not believe a word they tell you,” D.C. Chief of Police Douglas Gardner warned the public. “They will tell you they care and that they are normal, decent human beings, but believe me, there is almost no limit to the amount of damage these monsters could do.” “And now they’ve taken control of the nation’s legislative chambers,” Gardner added. “May God have mercy on us all.” The sociopaths currently occupying the Capitol, reports confirmed, come from all 50 states. They show pure ambition, naked greed, and have a cold, dead look in their eyes that eyewitnesses have called “chilling.” Authorities cautioned that the next few hours are crucial and potentially volatile, as psychological experts say the group of sociopaths may explode into acts of savage rage if they encounter a perceived threat or their attempts to grab power are opposed. “If they feel provoked, or if they feel in any way as if they are losing power or control, sociopathic personalities such as these will typically react quite harmfully, with little to no regard for the consequences their actions have on others,” noted psychologist Dr. Michael Segal told reporters. “We are talking about human beings, if you can even call them that, with a God complex. And yet they are so skilled at fooling others that they have been able to conceal themselves as functional members of society.” Fortunately, authorities say, at this time the assembled sociopaths appear rather disorganized and may ultimately be powerless to carry out any plan at all, and have been engaged for the last few hours in a series of nearly incoherent rants that make little rational sense. Still, there is no way, police stress, of knowing how far their mad ambition could take them. The exact number of sociopathic madmen currently occupying the Congressional chambers could not be determined as of press time, but some authorities say their number could be as many as 535.

"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA—Noting that the 37-year-old does not possess the looks, charisma, talent, or name recognition of a successful leading man, Hollywood insiders agreed Thursday that local account manager Dennis Kerning’s star power is not sufficient to carry a major motion picture. Studio executives, talent agents, and film critics alike spoke candidly to reporters about the Plano resident and father of one, explaining that Kerning is simply not an A-list celebrity, and in order to make a film bankable and worth a studio’s investment, you need an A-lister with a proven track record of hits, which sources reiterated Kerning does not have. “Quite frankly, it’s hard to imagine Dennis ever being cast in a big-budget film, let alone carrying one on his own,” Paramount Pictures executive Roger Hammond said of Kerning, who has reportedly spent his entire career in pharmaceutical marketing and enjoys his work. “It takes someone with the whole package—the right skills, style, and sex appeal—to connect with a mass audience, and let’s be honest here, Dennis Kerning has none of that.” “And I’m sorry, I just don’t think there’s enough buzz around this guy to line up tens of millions of dollars in financing,” he added. “From what I can tell, there isn’t any buzz at all.” Dozens of industry experts echoed Hammond’s assessment, arguing that it would be completely impossible to secure a distribution deal with wide release on the strength of the name Dennis Kerning. They also confirmed they had absolutely no reason to believe Kerning would be capable of generating attention at Sundance, Cannes, or Comic-Con, regardless of the role he played or the genre of movie he appeared in. While acknowledging that Kerning may be a great dad, a dedicated youth soccer coach, and an active member of his community, New York–based film producer Sarah Wilmington said that doesn’t mean audiences are ready to go on a two-hour action-packed journey with him. “Movies are competing with a variety of media today, and I honestly don’t see people shelling out 12 bucks just to see the new Dennis Kerning flick, you know?” said Wilmington, predicting that a film with Kerning in the lead role would not perform well domestically and would fare even worse in key foreign markets like China and Japan. “He hasn’t been in a single blockbuster. Even Shia LaBeouf was cast in some supporting roles before he started playing the lead in $200 million installments of valuable franchise properties.” “Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Dennis Kerning—I’d say it’s pretty obvious who doesn’t belong on that list,” Wilmington continued. “Let’s be realistic.” Other media experts pointed to Kerning’s negative ratings in focus groups, in which more than 90 percent of participants agreed with the statements “Dennis Kerning doesn’t have what it takes to be a commanding presence on screen,” “I can’t see myself taking my family or friends to a Dennis Kerning movie,” and “I probably wouldn’t even notice Dennis Kerning if he played any role in any movie.” “If you attach the name Dennis Quaid to a picture, maybe it gets somewhere; if you attach the name Dennis Kerning, it means nothing,” said   columnist Walter Rubin, adding that Kerning’s media profile is so low he wonders if the 37-year-old is even trying to court publicity in Hollywood. “When people see Dennis Kerning, they don’t see a movie star. They just don’t.” “Now, is it possible that Dennis could someday carry a TV show? Yeah, maybe,” Rubin continued. “But even then, I just don’t think he could make the transition from television to film.” Many high-profile directors expressed their reluctance to cast Kerning in a leading role, saying that while they could perhaps look past his lack of commitment to the film industry, they couldn’t ignore his lack of star power. “I’m in preproduction on a new movie right now, and I’m not even thinking about casting Dennis Kerning in the lead,” director Tim Burton said. “His name hasn’t once come up. This man is not on my radar. I’ve never had a meeting with him. I don’t even know who represents him.” “That being said, if Johnny Depp isn’t available, I have no idea what I’m going to do,” Burton added.

"CHICAGO—According to locals waiting for the westbound number 66 shuttle at Chicago Avenue and Racine Avenue, a young man and woman seated on a bench at the bus stop are currently making out like it’s fucking Paris or something. The couple—who appear to be in their early 20s and, sources said, are in the center of Chicago, not the City of Light—locked lips more than 15 minutes ago, and have since been seen nuzzling each other’s necks, staring deeply into each other’s eyes, and generally carrying on as if they were out for a stroll along the banks of the goddamn Seine. “For Christ’s sake, where are we, the Champs-Élysées?” said bus commuter Temisha Woodry, 38, adding that she has never witnessed such an amorous display at the stop, where most attempts at conversation are reportedly drowned out by the continuous noise of traffic from the nearby highway underpass. “Is that it? Are we on the most beloved and beautiful avenue in the world?” “Because I thought this was just a pot-holed road that goes to a shitty park,” Woodry added. After watching the pair embrace on the filthy bench as if it were a sun-dappled picnic blanket in the Tuileries, bystanders told reporters they immediately did a double take, checking to make sure they were, in fact, waiting at a bus stop in Chicago and not relaxing in the breathtaking gardens adjacent to the Louvre. Other commuters said that upon witnessing the marathon make-out session, they just assumed they must have stumbled into some kind of precious little candlelit bistro where young lovers meet on balmy Parisian nights, stealing kisses over a bottle of fine claret and imagining, if just for a moment, that they’re the only two people in the world. “Ugh, this isn’t the fucking Place de la Concorde,” said reluctant onlooker Diego Ojeda, 26, adding that the couple must think they’re embracing on “some goddamn moonlit bridge somewhere” instead of on a bench right off the I-94 interchange. “And it’s not the 1920s, either. The way they’re going at it, you’d think they had spent days apart, sitting at sidewalk cafés in the Latin Quarter, scribbling love poems in Moleskine notebooks, and desperately awaiting their next rendezvous.” “I just hope to God I don’t have to sit next to them,” he added. As they waited for the bus—which sources said the couple must think is some kind of private horse-drawn carriage coming to whisk them through the avenues of gay Paris—commuters said they did their best to look away from the increasingly eager groping of the lustful youths. The exception was a visibly intoxicated homeless man who reportedly leered at the pair, and whose tuneless humming the couple apparently must have mistook for the serenade of an accordionist playing sentimental melodies along a cobblestone side street in Montmartre. At press time, the bus had arrived, and riders confirmed they were impressed that the couple had managed to climb aboard, pay their fares, and take their seats while continuously “sucking face” and “not even coming up for fucking air.” ",1,Couple Making Out At Bus Stop Like It’s Fucking Paris

"CLINTON, NY—Expressing shame and remorse in an email to the students of Hamilton College on Friday, disgraced student affairs coordinator Jessica Li, 20, regretfully informed undergraduates that there would be no cool events occurring on campus this weekend. “On behalf of myself and everyone on the student activities council, I’d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I cannot express how utterly sorry I am for the actions of this committee and the terrible mistakes we’ve made,” wrote the humiliated student officer, informing students there would not be any a cappella concerts, film screenings, or date auctions at any point from Friday night through Sunday, nor would there be an Ultimate Frisbee tournament, improv comedy show, African dance performance, guest lecture by a human rights advocate, or casino night. “Our goal was to bring amazing events to campus, coordinate fun activities for students, and foster a thriving college community, and we failed at that. This falls on us, and we deserve every bit of your disappointment and ridicule.” The email concluded by acknowledging that a French Club open house was scheduled for Saturday afternoon, but noted that it was by no means awesome and was absolutely not recommended by committee members.

Wasserman, who for the last three years has worked as an administrative assistant at KPL Insurance Group, has reportedly amassed over 250,000 rabid followers since first taking Twitter by storm in 2009 and has since blown up into one of the most prominent and popular voices in the social media sphere. “I try to add something new to the conversation with every post,” said Wasserman, who sources claim totally kills it with his tweets day in, day out and receives absolutely no benefits from his employer. “My followers expect the best, and I take that as a responsibility to always give them something to really think about.” “I’m constantly pushing the boundaries with my tweets,” added the man who makes approximately $1,600 per month after taxes and has not made a student loan payment in over two years. “I started a Tumblr a few months ago too, because sometimes 140 characters just doesn’t cut it for what I need to say.” According to sources, Wasserman receives over 300 retweets and 400 favorites on each of the roughly 30 tweets he posts daily. The universally proclaimed “Twitter luminary” also reportedly attracts hundreds of new followers every week and has a $1,000 monthly credit limit on his VISA card. “I post about all sorts of things—news, politics, music, movies, and just plain old everyday stuff,” said the big-time social media hotshot who rides the bus to and from work every day. “I’m happy that what I write resonates so deeply with people, but I try not to get too wrapped up in all the Twitter mentions and ‘Follow Friday’ shout-outs. I’m always thinking about my next post.” Wasserman’s every move is said to be fawned over by his rapidly growing base of supporters, all of whom voraciously read anything the social media sensation posts in his downtime between collating photocopies, filing payroll forms, and brewing coffee for his boss. “I check RWthinks’ feed every day because that guy is basically the king of the Internet,” 31-year-old Twitter user Daniel Parker said of the man who has $900 in his checking account. “I remember when he favorited my reply to one of his tweets, and I was just so excited. I can’t believe he even read it, with all the replies he gets.” “I started following him on Instagram too, and the guy just lights it up nonstop wherever he goes,” Parker continued. “I don’t know how he does it. He’s just all over the place.” Sources confirmed that Wasserman, who is paid $13 per hour and is not eligible for overtime, appears regularly on the FavStar daily leaderboard and is frequently featured in “Must Follow” lists from the  , CNN, and  . Influential Twitter users such as musician Questlove, actress Olivia Wilde, Mashable founder Pete Cashmore, and NBA star Blake Griffin also follow Wasserman’s tweets, which the high-profile social media icon reportedly writes on the iPhone his parents bought him and still keep on their family plan. Moreover, experts say the swift ascent of the 28-year-old entry-level employee into the upper echelons of internet superstardom is showing no signs of slowing down. “There’s no two ways about it: Ryan Wasserman owns social media right now,” said Gawker social media analyst Haley Iacona, noting that the internet phenom, who pays $650 per month to share a two-bedroom apartment with a 23-year-old he met through Craigslist, has built a far-reaching and fervid global audience. “He’s an absolute Twitter machine. He just has his finger on the pulse like nobody else out there right now. One retweet from him and you’re guaranteed to get at least a few hundred more followers.” At press time, sources confirmed Wasserman was sitting on his full-sized futon purchased from a used furniture store, watching the retweets pour in as his latest Twitter post went viral.

"WHIPPANY, NJ—Local mentally ill man Michael Redding, 26, announced his intention Thursday to display one or two further instances of troubling behavior before finally going ahead and carrying out what he has planned. “I’ll do a couple more clearly disconcerting things in public locations in front of people who know who I am, then that’s it—I’m going through with it,” said the severely unstable man, noting that his increasingly erratic and worrisome conduct over the past few months has so far been ignored or gone unnoticed by his family, colleagues, and therapist. “Maybe I’ll blow up and scream at an acquaintance for no reason, or I might just become totally unresponsive and withdrawn—who knows? All I can say is that I’ll throw up about two more red flags and then it will be time.” At press time, Redding reportedly finished publishing a set of disturbing thoughts on social media and verbally threatened a coworker, and is now ready to act on his plan.

"NEW YORK—After fluctuating wildly this morning between $1 and $35, the price of money spiked to an unprecedented $90 a dollar in afternoon trading, plunging international financial markets into chaos. “Wall Street erupted into absolute pandemonium once the price of a dollar jumped past $50—if this keeps up, I wouldn’t be surprised if the dollar reached $275 or higher by the closing bell,” said CNBC analyst Marvin Kanisch, noting that the price of 20 dollars had soared well over $1,000 amid frenzied trading before plummeting back down to a more reasonable $430, while the price of five dollars remained steady at $5. “Everywhere you look, panicked investors are clamoring to exchange their dollars—which can only purchase about two cents apiece right now—for more stable dimes and quarters, which are trading at $18 and $32.25, respectively. And with the price of pennies falling below $140 an ounce, it’s easy to understand the sense of urgency. Bottom line: It’s a seller’s market.” With the skyrocketing dollar-to-dollar exchange rate prompting Americans to hoard as much money as possible, President Obama is expected to address the nation later today about easing America’s dependence on domestic currency.

"CHICAGO—Upon spotting the blue carabiner connecting his keys to his pants’ belt loop, coworkers of local software engineer Peter Slotnick speculated Tuesday that the 34-year-old man must rappel into their office building every morning. “After seeing the way Pete carries around his house keys and electronic office-door fob, it’s obvious to me that he begins each day by gliding effortlessly down a rope along the exterior of the building, skillfully bouncing off the façade every 10 feet or so,” said colleague Eileen Pickering, adding that after he descends to the 14th floor, Slotnick likely pushes off one final time before bursting through the window into the conference room, rolling across the floor, brushing bits of glass from his clothing, and seating himself for the company’s morning meeting. “I bet while we’re all taking the stairs or walking to lunch, he’s swinging over alleyways or maybe zip-lining his way around the city on a network of secured steel cables. He probably just clips that thing on and away he goes.” Coworkers added that the small Swiss Army knife Slotnick keeps on his keyring must come in handy on days he needs to skin and field-dress large game on his commute home.

"LONGMONT, CO—In a stern warning aimed at critics of Mazdas everywhere, area man Matthew Hunker, a longtime Mazda driver with two Mazdas in his garage at home, said Thursday his loyalty to the car manufacturer was so strong that he would be willing to kill in its name. “If I catch you or anyone else talking rudely or disrespectfully about Mazda or the Mazda family of automobiles, then God help you, because I’ll break into your house at night and snap your fucking neck,” said Hunker, raising a clenched fist and adding that the Japanese company’s ability to deliver style, affordability, and fuel efficiency, as well as top-of-the-line features like dual-zone automatic climate control, put it in a class all by itself. “I am not afraid of prison. You say one word against the MX-5 Miata, and I’ll kill you in cold blood like the sick infidel you are. I was born a Mazda man, and I’ll die one. Watch your fucking back.” Sources later confirmed Hunker was on the trail of a local consumer who allegedly questioned whether the subcompact Mazda2 was a better value than the Honda Fit.

People just can’t get enough of the guy.” So far, “Weeping Guy” has already spawned dozens of spin-off videos featuring YouTube users crying alone in their own homes, with hundreds more expected by the end of the day.

"TALLAHASSEE, FL—Saying that he’s “okay-looking but definitely nothing special,” employees at Southeastern Publishing Services reported Wednesday that Brian Tyler, a 27-year-old digital communications coordinator widely considered to be the cutest guy in the office, is not even particularly attractive. “It’s funny, because he’s nicer to look at than any other guy here, for sure, but you wouldn’t even give him a second glance if you saw him in a crowd or at a party,” said assistant sales manager Jessica Hartman, echoing thoughts reportedly shared by all of her coworkers. “Anywhere else he’d be pretty average, but here people treat him like he’s Ryan Gosling or something. You’d think in an office this size there would be someone cuter, but nope, out of the 50 or so guys who work here, he’s basically as hot as it gets.” Pressed further on the issue of Tyler’s attractiveness, several staff members acknowledged that if the circumstances arose, sure, they’d fuck him, why not?

"PURCHASE, NY—Following the saboteur antics of a prankster focus group that reportedly convinced company officials the drink was not only palatable but delicious, PepsiCo announced Thursday the launch of its new Mountain Dew CinnaBlast beverage. “CinnaBlast absolutely tested through the roof!” said vice president of marketing Brad Sheets, unaware the enthusiasm expressed by the ill-intentioned group of consumer taste-testers was wholly and deliberately misleading. “They were saying, ‘This is  —keep the cinnamon coming!’ And that’s exactly what we did. They also had some great ideas we may try out in the future, like adding nutmeg, putting some cloves in there, or encouraging people to drink it hot.” Reached for comment, members of the spiteful focus group admitted they had almost recommended PepsiCo use a jingle built around Lou Bega’s “Mambo No. 5,” but ultimately decided that would be going too far.

"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Economists at Harvard University released a new study this week indicating that Americans who paint themselves silver and pretend to be statues in public spaces make, on average, $10 million per year. “Our extensive, nationwide survey found that painting yourself a metallic color and standing perfectly still in front of strangers is not only a smart career choice, but one of the most lucrative professions in the country,” said lead researcher Ronald Morrow, noting that in larger markets such as Houston and New York, the median annual incomes of these motionless performers increases to “20 or 30 million, easy.” “Their overhead is limited to a few gallons of paint and some old bedsheets, and because it’s purely a cash business, their revenues may actually be much higher than what they’re reporting. For all we know, those guys painted to look like Statues of Liberty and standing in hotspots like Times Square could be pulling in $1 million every single day.” Economists added that while most people break into the profession by portraying iconic figures, earning power only increases with the ability to make startling movements that can “scare the bejeezus” out of passersby.

"RENO, NV—Despite her continued efforts to drive him out of his goddamn mind and turn his every waking hour into some kind of living nightmare, Craig Shearer, 32, admitted Monday that he still loves that crazy bitch.  ""Aw, who am I kidding? That nut-job's really got my number,"" Shearer told reporters after being locked out of the apartment he shares with the total psycho. ""She may not give me a moment's peace and I can't mention another woman's name without hearing about it for a week, but what can I do? She's the one. That fucking lunatic is the one."" Shearer then concluded his address, sighed, and began gathering his shirts and pants from his front lawn. Shearer's proclamation of love for that big sack of crazy comes in direct contradiction to a statement he made at the Loading Dock nightclub last week. After getting into an argument with his girlfriend over not taking her computer classes seriously enough, Shearer was reportedly thrown out of the bar at the request of the fucking basket case, who just five minutes later assaulted the bouncer for ""getting in her business"" and was thrown out herself. During the intervening minutes, Shearer made a number of public statements regarding his girlfriend's unstable mental health, fluctuating emotions, and irritating pine-nut allergy before reconciling with the bat-shit insane woman in the backseat of their car. Although Shearer has tried multiple times to leave that crazy bitch once and for all, he has thus far been unsuccessful. His most recent attempt came shortly after she arrived at his office sobbing over the death of her seventh straight pet parakeet, but was ultimately delayed when Shearer couldn't imagine his life without the raving sociopath.  ""Maybe it's the way she dumped her nail polish on my pool table when I insulted her sister, or the way she cries every time I eat veal, but damned if I don't adore her crazy ass,"" Shearer said. ""I'll kill her someday, I swear, but that wack-job is going to end up being the mother of my children."" Friends said they have seen the couple go through many difficult times in years past, including that night when the crazy bitch had a little bit too much to drink and accused Shearer of hiding money from her, and that incident, a few weeks back, when she locked herself inside the bathroom and refused to come out until Shearer had thrown away the casserole she cooked, like she knew he wanted to. Still, sources confirmed that Shearer and his old lady always seem to work things out in the end, a trend that may suggest those crazy fucks are perfect for each other. ""If my girlfriend wrote 'limp dick' in permanent marker on all my work shirts because I said Kate Winslet was hot, I'd probably leave her,"" Shearer's longtime friend James Pennette said. ""But Craig? Man, does he have it bad for that crazy bitch."" Pennette could not be reached for further comment, as he is currently recovering in West Hills Hospital for talking shit about the love of Shearer's life.

"WALTHAM, MA—Potentially offering hope to millions of Americans struggling with psychological and emotional problems, a study published this week in   found that test subjects were capable of fully resolving their anxiety by thinking about it very intensely. The study, which followed 1,200 adults suffering from mild unease to chronic anxiety, confirmed that focusing continuously and exclusively on one’s own specific sources of distress to the point that one’s mental and physical health began to suffer was associated with the complete elimination of anxiety from patients’ lives and their subsequent return to happiness and emotional well-being. “Of the hundreds of individuals we studied, those who thought about their feelings of dread and apprehension at every moment of every day—including throughout their workdays, at home, and in social outings—were able to effectively cure themselves of anxiety in 100 percent of cases,” said psychiatrist and lead researcher Rajiv Menon of the University of Virginia. “Whether someone is feeling overwhelmed at the office or constantly pondering whether their relationship might be falling apart, it appears that incessantly agonizing over this source of stress is all that’s required to eliminate your feelings of tension about this subject altogether and leave you feeling untroubled and fully satisfied with your life.” “The results are clear,” Menon continued. “The more you obsessively worry about something bad that has already happened or about something bad that may happen in the future, the better you’ll feel.” According to Menon, research participants who focused all their mental energy on fretting passed through three distinct stages as their feelings of angst were systematically eradicated. First, subjects frantically overanalyzed each detail of their particular anxiety, after which they mentally tormented themselves regarding every single thing that could possibly go wrong. Finally, and most crucially according to the data, subjects beat themselves up over their stresses to such a degree that they became virtually paralyzed, rendering themselves too impaired to function in most aspects of their lives. After completing these three stages, Menon confirmed that every subject was found to be completely free of anxiety and immediately went forward leading a normal life. “The key to beating anxiety is to let yourself become totally consumed with intrusive, irrational thoughts until you actually raise your pulse and blood pressure,” said assistant researcher Dana Kelley, who said that blinding stress headaches were a crucial indicator that one’s anxious feelings were disappearing. “If you can get to a point where you legitimately feel short of breath and begin to perceptibly tremble, that means you’re progressing. In fact, the more tense your neck and shoulders are, the closer you are to moving past your anxiety altogether.” “Lying awake in bed for hours every night due to your singular, debilitating focus on your insecurities is a great start, but ideally you want to get to a point where you have horrible nightly anxiety dreams that persist throughout your few fitful hours of sleep,” Kelley added. “That’s a clear sign your anxiety is almost entirely gone.” Kelley warned individuals, however, not to attempt to take a step back and distance themselves from their angst issues or try to gain a rational perspective on their fears, as such efforts caused immediate spikes in their overall levels of anxiety, setting their treatment back weeks. In addition, she urged friends and family members of those suffering from anxiety to be as dismissive as possible about their loved ones’ conditions, noting that hearing frequent belittling and condescending remarks about how their fears were “not valid” and “nothing to worry about” was correlated with markedly enhanced and expedited recoveries among test subjects. One of the study’s participants, April Willis, 41, praised the research for resolving deep-seated insecurities about her appearance and competence, citing in particular the effectiveness of a technique in which she mentally replays her most anxiety-inducing thoughts and memories over and over in her head at all hours of day and night. “After years of struggling with anxiety, I found that the cure was as simple as mentally torturing myself over every last shred of disquiet in my life until I became so riddled with doubt and unease that I was unable to eat or sleep,” Willis told reporters. “Once I obsessively worried to a point that I was effectively debilitated and felt that I barely even wanted to go on, then, poof, the anxiety went away for good.” “So now when I sense any anxiety, no matter how minor, I just allow my intrusive, anxious thoughts to take over and take me wherever they choose—it’s that simple,” added a smiling Willis. “If I can do it, so can you!” ",1,Study: Anxiety Resolved By Thinking About It Real Hard
"NEW YORK—Media consumers across the United States are reporting this week that sponsored content—articles and videos paid for by advertisers and distributed by print and digital publications—is easily the coolest fucking published material anyone could ever read or watch. “I love, love,   sponsored content,” said news and entertainment reader Erica Olson, adding that when she can tell a corporation is financially behind a piece of writing, she is even more inclined to click on it. “First off, it’s cool. That’s not debatable. Second, I don’t find it in any way insulting to my intelligence. In fact, it makes me feel smarter. And third, did I mention that sponsored content is just really fucking cool?” “Oh, awesome, a sponsored post by a snack food company on my favorite media website,” Olson added, later saying that these days she basically only reads articles that have a “Sponsored By” heading. “Not only am I excited to read it, but it makes me think that—because the editorial content on my website of choice appeals to me—I would probably really enjoy the brand trying to associate itself with it. I mean, they’re working together, after all!” Sources confirmed that while a majority of Americans can’t get enough sponsored posts, an even greater number “really fucking love and appreciate” when content written for advertisers is seamlessly woven into a publication’s regular material, thereby leaving readers confused as to whether or not they are reading an advertisement or original writing from the publication’s creative staff. Furthermore, Americans praised media companies for working so closely with advertisers for coming up with “really awesome and creative” strategies designed to trick them into consuming articles and videos endorsed by faceless corporate conglomerates. “I would say that I’m happiest when I’m being taken advantage of and duped into reading what is essentially a company’s propaganda disguised as actual editorial content,” said Colorado resident Colin Portman, adding that he wanted to personally thank media publications for regularly including sponsored content in their production schedules. “See, when I’m reading an article and then I have to take a step back and say, ‘Wait a minute, the font, writing style, and overall tone is like the website I typically enjoy, but this is actually an advertisement for a car company,’ I smile and just keep on reading. It’s like a treat.” “It’s at those moments when I trust my favorite publication even more, and in no way harbor any resentment toward them for taking advantage of my loyalty,” Portman added. “I also like the product being advertised because they didn’t completely ruin a deeply personal reading experience I once cherished.” According to a recent CBS/  poll, 82 percent of respondents said sponsored content is the absolute fucking best, 64 percent said editorial integrity is overrated anyway, and nearly 100 percent said that articles that have a clear line of distinction between editorial and business needs “suck shit.” An overwhelming amount of respondents said they hope websites, newspapers, and magazines begin producing nothing   sponsored material so that media consumers can just sit back and read and watch advertisements all day long. “You see, the reason these types of posts are so fucking incredible and great is because the people coming up with the ideas—people in the advertising and business world—are so smart and very,   cool. They really know what people like. They’re experts, really. Geniuses,” media critic Jeff Cohen told reporters. “From the person on the media company’s sales team who is looking for a quick buck, to the corporation’s executives who could give a flying fuck about destroying everything a brand stands for, everyone is so committed to producing what, I think we can all agree, is groundbreaking and artistically inspired content.” In addition to saying that corporate-sponsored material is essentially what modern-day journalism should be, Americans mentioned how much they were enjoying the latest season of the ABC series   and how they only go to Target for all their home-shopping needs. Furthermore, sources confirmed that because people who enjoy sponsored content are obviously the hippest people around, they must also use Axe, which is by far the hippest brand of male grooming products on the market today.

Not everyone can skate by on an abiding commitment to self-discipline, a scholarly passion for justice, and a pair of shining baby-blue eyes. God, the luck and unrelenting dedication of some people!” Sources further noted that Preston’s wife, Jessica, probably only married him because he’s handsome, has a stable, well-paying job, is unfailingly kind, and selflessly devotes himself to building a long-term future for his family.

"Listen up, world. It's been a long, hard road, but here I am, at the top of the heap. Well, not the top, exactly, but pretty darn close. Relatively speaking. No, no, over here. Yeah. Below the first two guys. That's right, sucker! You're talking to ""the Man,"" more or less. The real deal, somewhat. The head honcho in charge should anything happen to the other two honchos directly above him. The top No. 3 guy. How'd I get here? Well, it's quite a story. Probably not as interesting or inspiring a story as that of the two men ahead of me, but quite a story nonetheless. You see, as a boy, I was teased mercilessly by the other kids at school. But then one night as I lay in bed crying, I realized that I had a choice: I could either live my life as a doormat for the entire world or as a doormat for a select few, wiping my boots on the majority of people remaining below me. ""Someday I'll show most of them,"" I told myself that night. ""Someday I'll show practically all of them!"" And with that solemn oath, I began my journey to the far-from-unlofty position that I hold today: the position of gamma male. And a hard-fought battle it was. For being gamma male is not a birthright. It takes a combination of rarefied skills to achieve. Skills like an insatiable lust to dominate everything you see within reason, to lead and give orders every now and then, to climb all the way up the ladder and not stop unless there are a couple of way more powerful guys standing in your way. These qualities must be cultivated by anyone hoping to wear the admirable-bordering-on-enviable badge of gamma. But it was all worth it for my life near the top. Why, I'd hate to think where I'd be today if I hadn't put in so much effort all those years. Maybe sixth in life. Or, God forbid, seventh. Yes, spitting distance from the next-best thing to absolute power is an awesome responsibility, and the rewards are incredible. I basically have power over everything those directly in front of me decide to pass on. When there's an important decision to be made, I get to silently nod and even raise my eyebrows here and there. Plus, on top of all that, the ladies can't resist me if Ken and Stephen aren't around. Be jealous if you will, but hey, that's just how it goes when you're only marginally inferior to the best. It comes down to the law of the jungle: Someone has to take charge. And after they do, they've got to appoint a lieutenant to help carry out their wishes.

And he's got to make sure everything is in perfect working order for when the two people ahead of him finally arrive. You got me? Huh? Hey, how do you like that? Hey, PUNK, I asked you a—OH, GOD.

"NEW YORK—A report published Friday by a team of sociologists has confirmed there are apparently people living in the world today who are deeply concerned about the current state of hip-hop and who continually express genuine worry over the musical genre’s future. According to the findings, at any given moment, hundreds of very serious conversations about the changing face of hip-hop are taking place, with many individuals appearing to have an actual emotional stake in matters such as the values of modern-day rappers, technology’s impact on the music, and Gucci Mane’s eventual place in cultural history. “These people actually exist,” said New York University sociologist David Wolfsheim, who stressed that he was not referring just to artists, music industry employees, or even professional critics, but to everyday individuals who, for reasons not yet understood, feel a heavy personal investment in the state of hip-hop. “They experience true anxiety, day in and day out, about where the music has been and where it’s headed, almost as if their own futures depended upon it.” “Believe it or not, these are otherwise normal people who are unable to listen to a single track by someone like Lil Wayne or Rick Ross without immediately worrying about whether the song remains true to hip-hop’s roots,” Wolfsheim continued. “This is a real thing that happens.” Calculations from the report indicate that the amount of time and energy such individuals devote to their concern over the quality of today’s hip-hop artists and the direction it is taking is roughly equivalent to what ordinary human beings might devote to working hard at a chosen career, spending time with family and loved ones, or finding ways to actually contribute something to the communities in which they live. The report also confirmed that the sentences “Mainstream hip-hop is losing its street edge,” “The over-commercialization of rap is ruining modern music,” and “Sometimes, it seems like nothing will ever top classic Public Enemy,” are all statements that have been uttered with full sincerity over the past year. “Many of these individuals have been known to devise complex theories as to why hip-hop’s sound has changed over the years, and some have even written serious, in-depth manifestos on how the genre’s ‘authenticity’ can be restored,” Wolfsheim said. “Most worryingly, perhaps, the stress levels observed in these individuals as they discuss hip-hop’s declining relevance to our culture is off the charts.” “They get really, really upset about it,” he added. In addition, Wolfsheim noted the discovery of hundreds of websites and blogs that appear to be entirely dominated by very earnest debates about what it means to be a true hip-hop artist, and how a higher level of consciousness “must” be revived in rap. According to estimates, approximately 237 million words have been devoted to the theory that the music has changed because today’s performers didn’t “come up as hard” as earlier generations and will “just say whatever it takes to sell a record.” Thirty-nine-year-old Boise, ID resident Wallace Briggs, a real-life human being who described himself as “deeply troubled by at least nine distinct trends in modern hip-hop,” spoke to reporters Friday about his gravest fears. “Sometimes I lie awake in the middle of the night thinking, my God, what if the golden age of hip-hop is over for good?” said Briggs, a physical therapist and father of two. “It’s devastating. I just don’t know if the artists emerging today can ever restore the social relevance and cultural vibrancy of the music.” Pressed for further comment, Briggs acknowledged that he has been voicing this exact same sentiment about hip-hop since 1988.

"CHARLOTTE, NC—Stressing that there is “probably no need to get involved,” Charlotte Bobcats head coach Steve Clifford expressed confidence Thursday that a fierce ongoing dispute over unpaid gambling debts between two of his players will just work itself out. “They seem pretty upset right now, but I’m sure that if I give them some time and space, they’ll settle it amongst themselves before anything boils over,” said Clifford, adding that seeing the players physically restrained by teammates while one furiously demands that the other “pay the fuck up right now” is almost certainly just normal banter between guys in the locker room. “Given that they were only talking about a few thousand dollars from a card game, I’m sure they’ll resolve the whole thing pretty quickly—after all, these guys are professionals, so they know how to conduct themselves.

"CAMBRIDGE, MA—During a press conference Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leading members of the scientific community confirmed that despite decades of research, the best available theoretical models still cannot predict more than one upcoming Tetris block. While they have long possessed the technology to accurately forecast and display which of the seven distinct Tetris shapes, or tetrominoes, will appear next, scientists told reporters they’ve so far had no success determining what any of the blocks beyond the immediate successor will be. “Modern supercomputers have now reached speeds of 30 quadrillion calculations per second, but even with all that processing power, we’re no closer to solving this problem than we were a generation ago,” said MIT professor Michael Haemlin, who has studied tetromino sequencing since 1984. “Right now our most sophisticated equations can correctly predict two upcoming blocks just one out of every seven times, which unfortunately is no better than the result achieved by random guessing.” “So for years, all we’ve been able to do is rotate each descending shape 90 degrees at a time, control its lateral movement, accelerate the speed of its descent if desired, and simply hope for the best,” Haemlin added. According to researchers, the ability to predict two, three, or four incoming shapes would be “nothing short of revolutionary,” allowing blocks to be stacked in more optimal patterns in order to achieve the goal of eliminating horizontal lines as efficiently as possible. For example, with enough advanced warning of an arriving I-shaped piece, scientists said they could in theory prepare the Tetris matrix in such a way that up to four rows are cleared simultaneously, with many stating this was one of the ultimate goals of their rigorous stacking trials. “Over the past 30 years, we’ve developed a much better understanding of how blocks fit together,” said Dr. Florence Edelman, the designer of a well-known Tetris experiment in 1993 in which a perfect slot for an L or zigzag block was created under carefully controlled conditions, only to be closed off when a series of ill-fitting square pieces appeared instead. “But without a working predictive model, our entire field of study is at an impasse. Indeed, reaching unpassable standstills is well chronicled in trial after trial.” “Some of the world’s most brilliant scientific minds have dedicated their lives to unlocking this mystery, yet for all their knowledge and expertise, it’s still anyone’s guess what will happen five or 10 seconds into the future,” Edelman continued. “Once that last bit of uncertainty has been eliminated, we believe our interactions within the Tetris matrix will be far more successful.” Edelman stated that many aspects of Tetris are indeed predictable, noting that workers in her lab had discovered that each falling piece is consistently composed of four individual tiles; that the speed at which descents occur increase in direct proportion to total time elapsed; that pieces with the same shape also share the same color; and that while the color of a piece is not particularly important, its shape is of vital significance. Foreknowledge of those shapes, she explained, could lead to a breakthrough phenomenon she described as “a perpetual Tetris” of unlimited duration. “While this remains entirely hypothetical at this moment, there exists a theoretical point at which the elimination of bottom rows occurs with such speed and efficiency that there is always enough room at the top of the matrix to accommodate new pieces,” Edelman said. “This would create a fluid and sustainable Tetris that could exist indefinitely—perhaps forever. It would of course still require continuous human maintenance, but it would be a monumental step in the right direction.” “For now, though,” she added. “We’ll simply keep trying and see how far we are able to progress.” ",1,Modern Science Still Only Able To Predict One Upcoming Tetris Block

"When I walk into the office on Monday, the guys always ask me what I did over the weekend, and my answer is always the same: I played laser tag! Laser tag is a fun game of strategy, quick thinking, and constant action. When I was younger, I used to spend hours playing tag with my friends—but this game of ""tag"" is not just for kids. Adults can have a great time playing it too! Whether you're 7 or 107, laser tag is the best! Okay, everybody enjoys playing sports, right? Well, laser tag is just another kind of sport, except better! Laser tag gives you all the thrills of competition with none of the contact. Plus, it's great exercise, and the simulated ""warfare"" gives you a huge adrenaline rush. You can have fun playing laser tag at any skill level, whether you just started or you've been playing for 20 years. It may just be the best sport on earth. I certainly think so! In a lot of ways, laser tag is like a game of cowboys and Indians set in the future. Remember how much fun you had playing that game? Well, who said you had to stop? Being an adult doesn't mean you have to give up the stuff you love! In fact, I'd go so far as to say laser tag is an improvement on cowboys and Indians, because with laser tag you've got the computerized sensor system, so there's no debate over whether someone has ""hit"" you.  Just imagine if we had had that kind of technology when we were kids!  ZAP! Now, I know some people are opposed to laser tag because they think it promotes violence. But to all those sticks in the mud I always say, ""And what's football, then? Athletic hugging?"" Come on! I think it's pretty difficult to confuse a laser gun with a real gun, even for kids. Maybe one day we'll be shooting lasers at aliens out in space, but for right now, it's just good clean fun for every age! And anyway, the lasers used in laser tag are real low-grade, so you don't have to worry about hurting your eyes. Take my advice: Get a big group of friends or coworkers together, head down to your local laser tag arena, and get ready to have the most fun you've ever had in your life. I don't think there's anything in the world like the thrill of playing laser tag. It's like being on another planet or in some video game, except this is not a video game—it's the real thing! Just make sure you've cleared your afternoon, because once you're suited up, you're not going to want to leave! Trust me, as soon as you fire your first laser gun, you'll wonder why you ever stopped playing tag. So just let go and allow yourself to have a great time. After all, why should kids get to have all the fun? Excuse me, sir? Could you step into the hall, please? Thank you. We've received some complaints from the other parents about your behavior in the arena, and it has come to my attention that you may not be here with a child. Sir, I'm going to need you to stop watching the game for a minute and look at me. I'm afraid that the rules are clear and as it is our policy here at LaserAdventure to provide fun family entertainment to players 7 years and older, unless you are here with your son or daughter, I'm going to have to ask you to turn over your gun and sensor pack. No, sir, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to let you ""get back out there"" unless it is to accompany a minor. But if you'd prefer it, I could have my manager speak to you about our Player's Code, which you signed on the way in here. As you can see on the banner above me, we here at LaserAdventure always put fun first and the fun at LaserAdventure is simply contagious. It is our goal to give everyone the best experience possible, which is why we do not allow aggressive or ""professional"" play in the main arena. Sir, please stop pointing your gun at me. I've already deactivated it, and I'm not wearing a laser sensor. If you don't stop, I will be forced to have you escorted off the premises by mall security. I am not an ""enemy combatant,"" nor do I have any idea who this ""they"" is you seem to think has sent me, unless you're talking about the team of 8-year-olds from the Hannah Montana birthday party you've been picking off from atop the refueling station for the past half hour. And yes, before you say anything, I admit, there is nothing   written in the Player's Code that prevents a man in his mid-30s from playing laser tag at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday against no one but middle schoolers, but frankly, sir, it's never been an issue before. Most of the adults who come in here just stand on the sidelines in case the children need them. We also traditionally allow players to pick their own names, although I'm sure you'll agree that choosing ""Blood_Shall_Run"" was a less than appropriate selection given the circumstances. Also, the release you signed before playing makes you financially responsible for any damage you cause, and I'm fairly certain the pee-wee baseball team you were playing with didn't get the idea to kick out the black lights in the corner and start a POW camp on their own. Yes, sir, I agree with you that ""war is hell,"" but may I remind you that offensive language and threats directed to either the LaserAdventure staff or the parents of players, even those whose children you do not feel are pulling their weight, are not permitted at any time within the establishment? I understand you were just having fun, but since you are clearly unable to follow the rules and regulations of LaserAdventure, I'm going to have to ask you to vacate the premises immediately.  Fine, sir. You are more than welcome to come back next time ""with a real gun"" and see if we listen to you any more closely then, but I can assure you we won't. Good day, sir.

"LONDON—Citizens from Northumberland to Hampshire are buzzing with excitement as Queen Elizabeth II, 82, formally announced that she is expecting the arrival of another baby, just 532 months after giving birth to Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The British monarch and her consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, 87, confirmed rumors Tuesday that the queen recently entered her second trimester, and that a little Baron or Baroness of Renfrew is on the way. England’s royal couple, who were married in 1947, said they were “absolutely delighted” to be having their first child in more than four decades. “I’m so thrilled to be pregnant again,” said Queen Elizabeth II, who gave birth to her first son shortly after Great Britain granted India its independence. “Prince Philip and I have wanted this for many, many years. The entire United Kingdom has been blessed by this tiny little miracle.” The queen, modeling her maternity robe of state and pulling it tightly around her waist to show off the slight bulge of the fetus growing inside her, claimed that she initially wore loose- fitting ceremonial gowns to hide her expanding belly and swollen breasts from the public. This past weekend, Queen Elizabeth invited her four middle-aged children to Windsor Castle to privately inform them that they were going to have a younger brother or sister. The glowing octogenarian, whose eyes sparkled through her cataracts, said she repeatedly assured her 59-year-old son, Prince Charles, that he was still special and that the baby would not replace him as the heir apparent to the crown. Her Majesty then met with her eight grandchildren and explained that she would need them to be extra-helpful around the palace when their little aunt or uncle was born. “The looks on their faces when I told them I could feel the baby kicking were simply priceless,” said the radiant queen, who reportedly invited her grandchildren to feel her stomach. All politely declined. In preparation for the new addition to the royal family, Queen Elizabeth has instructed her staff to convert the State Room of Buckingham Palace into a nursery, retrieved her old breast pump from the basement of Windsor Castle, and assembled a baby throne. The queen also located an old journal containing a list of her favorite baby names, which she wrote down just six weeks before Britain entered World War II. “I believe if I have a girl, I shall give her a pretty name such as Amberjill, Erline, or Cleva,” Queen Elizabeth said. “However, if it is a boy, he will be both child of and father to all Britons and therefore will need a dignified name such as Blaxton, Dalbert, Arkwright, or Egerton.” Although nearly half a century has passed since the queen gave birth to her youngest son, she has insisted that she will raise her new baby using traditional child-rearing methods, including breastfeeding and administering a daily decoction of sarsaparilla for whooping cough. Immediately after birth, the newborn will be expected to oversee the counties of Cornwall and Wiltshire, as well as appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury. Many British elite, including Margaret Thatcher and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, offered their congratulations to the queen, saying they were “extremely happy” and “somewhat surprised” to hear the news. Some citizens could barely put their excitement into words. “Oh my God,” Manchester native Dominick Martin said. “When did this happen?” While no announcements have been made regarding a baby shower, the queen will travel to each of her realms outside the United Kingdom over the next two months to allow her subjects a chance to celebrate her unborn child with colorful floats and processions. Upon returning home, Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to tour the English countryside, host a concert in which guitarist Brian May plays “Rock-A-Bye Baby” on the roof of Buckingham Palace, and suffer a massive stroke. In other royal news, recently hired Windsor Castle gardener Diego Marquez, 24, was unexpectedly elevated to Duke of Leinster during a private ceremony Monday.

"You know, seminal American author John Cheever and I have a lot in common. He needed to drink a fifth of scotch before he had the courage to utter a word to another human being, and so do I. Much like Cheever, I'm completely blotto by 10 a.m. because of a deep, withering fear that my family will eventually discover my bisexuality. And, to top it all off, we were both born in Wollaston, Massachusetts, if you can believe it! But just because he's one of history's finest short story writers, Cheever's epic benders are considered delightful, whereas   just got a ""serious problem with alcohol."" What a bunch of horseshit. You wouldn't believe some of the outlandish and totally inappropriate things my drunkenness has caused me to do. Dark, crazy stuff. But guess what? I didn't write  , so I'm a disgrace to everyone who loves me. It's discriminatory. Cheever abandons his wife and children for months at a time to drink himself near to death, and he's discussed joyfully in college lit courses. I do the same exact thing, and I'm denied visitation rights. Well excuse me for not examining the duality of human nature in just a few short pages of effortless prose. No one is as dismissive, callous, and downright cruel to his wife as I am. Just like Cheever, I put the blame for all of my self-loathing and paranoia squarely on her, and I drive her to the brink of insanity with my suicidal imbibing. Guess I should have scrawled out some delicately measured symbolism about the female desire for inner rebirth, and maybe I would have gotten the Pulitzer Prize instead of court-ordered counseling.  And of course, everyone was perfectly tickled when our dear national treasure John Cheever would say things to his son like, ""Are you completely without imagination and initiative?"" and ""You've always been a disappointment as a son."" Yep. That's all chalked up to his crisp, witty intellect. But if I so much as call Rich, Jr. a no-good untalented leech even once at a family gathering, it's reviled as unforgivable cruelty and abusive parenting. Is it too much to ask for a little recognition? I keep drinking and drinking and I'm no closer to being heralded as the greatest voice of my generation. There have been dozens of times when I've ended up drunk and nude, too incapacitated to clothe myself; but did I have a friend like John Updike there to help me clean up the vomit? Hell, no. Remember, I didn't pen ""The Swimmer,"" so John Updike wouldn't help me for shit. I'll bet John motherfucking Updike doesn't even know who I am. If Cheever is any guide, then my unchecked dipsomania should be earning me unparalleled praise by now. But America has room for only one lovable nihilistic alcoholic, so I'll always get the shit end of the stick.  Take the time I went to visit my friend Charlie in Iowa, for instance. As usual, I promptly got three sheets to the wind, my uncontrollable desire for male sexual contact got the better of me, and I repeatedly tried to shove my tongue down Charlie's throat. Cheever pulls the exact same gag on Fred Exley, everyone's all, ""that's our Johnny-boy, the poor tortured genius! Let's get him off to bed."" But Charlie was not inclined to give me the same benefit of the doubt. No sir. For me, it's a punch in the mouth and then off to the drunk tank to dry out for the night. Jesus Christ, Charlie, sorry I didn't win the fucking Guggenheim Fellowship based largely on the strength of only two short stories! I guess I'll have to make real sure to get a glowing review in the   before I try to pull something like that again. You know, I might actually be an even better drunk than Cheever ever was. Did Cheever ever wrestle a dog at his daughter's birthday? Not according to my research. Did Cheever ever drive 30 miles home from a party before realizing he had left his wife behind? Sorry, but that was me again. And also Raymond Carver. If anything, my superior narcissistic, drunken antics should be given at least as much credit than any of Cheever's stunts. In our society, however, you apparently have to be ""the Chekhov of the suburbs"" before those types of colossally thoughtless hijinks hold any type of cachet. I'm just as drunk, surly, and monstrously uncaring as Charles Bukowski, Kingsley Amis, Joyce, or Faulkner ever were, but you'll never hear respected professors exchanging wry anecdotes about my plastered rampages. I'd like to blow my head off with a shotgun right now, but I'd better sit down and crank out a few bullshit stories about Spain first. Then maybe people will fondly remember my abusive, destructive gin-soaked escapades.  ",1,How Come No One Celebrates My Alcoholism Like John Cheever's?
"NEW YORK—According to a report released Monday by the Modern Language Association, speakers of the  -based Klingon language outnumber individuals fluent in Navajo by a margin of more than seven-to-one.
 ""Navajo, a 3,000-year-old Native American tonal language belonging to the Athabaskan/Na-Dené group of tongues, is clearly dying and will likely be extinct by 2010,"" MLA president Frederick Toback said. ""Fortunately, though, the sad, steady decline of this once-proud Native American tongue has been more than offset by a rising interest in Klingon culture.""
 Klingon speakers said they are pleased with the report. ""Every day, more and more people are discovering the excitement and challenge of Klingon, or, as it's called by native speakers, tlhIngan-Hol,"" said Doug ""HoD trI'Qal"" Petersen, an official grammarian at the Klingon Language Institute. ""After just a few weeks of studying Klingon, you, too will be saying 'qo' mey poSmoH Hol!'""
 ""For those new to the language,"" Petersen continued, ""a terrific place to start is Marc Okrand's  , published by Pocket Books. After that, I'd suggest  , also by Okrand. A marvelous guide to all things Klingon, it contains everything from recipes for Durani lizard skins to the proper way to address a B'rel Scout to the complete lyrics to The Warrior's Anthem.""
 As membership in the KLI continues to swell, the Navajo population, whose lands occupy approximately 25,000 square miles in the four corners of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, has dwindled to 150,000.
 ""Our people are chained to the terrible suffering of our past like a falcon without wings,"" said Daniel Littlefoot, president of the Navajo Nation. ""We consume alcohol and it, in turn, consumes us.""
 With the surge of interest in Klingon has come a corresponding surge in publishing. Klingon-language editions of  ,   and The Bible are now available, as well as the classic Klingon tale  .
 ""More than 200 titles are currently available, with more on the way all the time,"" said Bob ""nIteb'Ha"" Janowitz, editor of HolQeD, a quarterly Klingon literary journal. ""It truly is a booming industry.""
 Though the basics of Navajo are still taught in some reservation schools, and the language is spoken ceremonially at tribal council meetings, most Navajos do not bother to retain their knowledge after leaving school.
 ""The number of truly fluent Navajo speakers stands at less than a thousand,"" Littlefoot said. ""And of these thousand, only a handful are less than 60 years old. Within a generation, our 4,000-year-old tongue will be dust.""
 ""We have people from all walks of life here,"" said Jennifer ""pekaQ"" Proehl, a member of the Klingon Language Institute's High Council. ""Students, computer programmers, salespeople—all of them banding together in the proud Klingon tradition.""
 According to Proehl, the Klingon language is just one part of a thriving Klingon culture. KLI members practice Klingon martial arts, participate in Klingon singing and storytelling sessions, and even perform spiritual ceremonies derived from the various   television series and films.
 ""What's happening with the Klingon language is extremely exciting,"" MLA associate director Stephen Hogue said. ""If its popularity continues to grow at the current rate, we may consider giving certain Klingon-speaking groups financial support in the form of grants and special-interest funding. Increasingly, the MLA is diverting funds from dying languages like Navajo to vibrant, emergent ones such as Klingon.""
 ""I know this is my home, but there isn't anything here for me,"" said unemployed Navajo nation member Leonard Murphy, 22, who dropped out of school at 14 and remembers little of the Navajo he learned in elementary school. ""Everyone's leaving, getting off the reservation. Now there's nothing to do here except drink beer and watch  .""

"AMIENS, FRANCE—Literary scholars announced Monday that they have unearthed a 33-page handwritten manuscript of ""The Camera-Phone,"" a short story believed to have been written in 1874 by French novelist Jules Verne, the man often considered to be the originator of modern science fiction. ""The discovery of this highly prophetic work is exciting in both a literary and a social context,"" Jean-Michel Frelseien of the Ecole-Polytechnique said Monday. ""This story of a hand-held communications and picture-taking device that leads to social upheaval in 21st-century France provides yet another example of Verne's celebrated prescience."" ""Le Telephon-Photographique,"" which Frelseien identified as having been written just after Verne's masterpiece  , is narrated by Gui Cingulaire, the nephew of brilliant but monomaniacal professor Bernard Cingulaire. An ambitious, gifted scientist, Bernard fails to predict that his invention, a portable telephone that can take photographs and send short script messages, will contribute to the breakdown of traditional manners among Parisians. Frelseien said the manuscript was found among the belongings of Verne's publisher, Pierre-Jules Hertzel, along with an uncompleted letter rejecting the work as ""pessimistic, preposterous, and unappealing in premise."" ""Verne's view of a 21st-century Paris overrun by camera-phone-toting nabobs is indeed dismal,"" Frelseien said. ""But in all of its particulars, the story is classic Verne. The main character is a strong-minded and brilliant scientist-inventor, symbolizing the ambition and drive of the Industrial Age. The clever but wide-eyed narrator's breathless appetite for knowledge pulls the reader along. And the technological centerpiece of the story—as usual, powered by Verne's beloved electricity—sets the stage for conflict between the characters."" ""Where the story departs from a typical Verne piece, however, is in the level of devastation wrought by the innovation,"" Frelseien added. ""The infuriated victims of the camera-phone-dominated society eventually put all of Europe to the torch."" The story, which has yet to be translated into English, has been lauded by literary scholars around the world. ""It's an absolutely wonderful and engaging piece of work,"" Harvard professor of French literature Neil McGraw said. ""Professor Cingulaire, a noted eccentric, is convinced by his unscrupulous creditors to patent and market his long-distance-communications and image-transmission device, in spite of his misgivings. At first, use of the phone is prevalent only among the bourgeois, but it soon spreads throughout social strata."" As use of the device becomes commonplace, McGraw said, normal societal relations between citizens break down. ""Rudeness becomes ubiquitous, as the device's infuriating notification-chimes invade every corner of public life,"" McGraw said. ""When the ethically bereft begin transmitting images obtained under questionable circumstances, espionage becomes so prevalent as to threaten the integrity of the French populace."" Frelseien and other scholars at the Ecole-Polytechnique are searching for other unpublished stories mentioned in the recently recovered papers, including ""The Massaging-Chair,"" ""Incident At A Café Of Thinking-Machines,"" and ""The Satellite Initiative For Strategic Defense.""

"NEW YORK—Sitting in the multinational corporation’s boardroom, Chase executives reportedly spent most of Friday afternoon nostalgically recalling the financial company’s hip-hop roots, reminiscing about being young bankers who helped create the vibrant music, cultural, and investment scene in the South Bronx. “Chase came from the streets, and we were part of this real underground banking movement that was thriving in hip-hop culture,” said Chase Consumer and Community Banking chairman Todd “Bizzy B” Maclin of the FDIC-insured institution’s early days in the late 1970s, before it became a household name. “Back in the day, our financial crew was down with Afrika Bambaataa, Morten Arntzen, the Cold Crush Brothers, Winthrop W. Aldrich—all the hip-hop pioneers.” “We were pushing the boundaries of providing lending services and experimenting with a lot of funky-ass fund transfers,” Maclin added. “Everybody in the Bronx knew that Chase had the freshest deposits, the freshest withdrawals, and the freshest adjustable-rate mortgages.” Maclin, who explained that the five pillars of hip-hop include DJing, rapping, graffiti art, breakdancing, and banking, spoke reverently about Chase’s origins at “old-school block parties.” While describing the lively culture that thrived from 1977 to 1983, before hip-hop banking had gone mainstream, Maclin told reporters that a diverse crowd of b-boys, fledgling financiers, and local residents attended the huge blowouts to listen to music, dance, and refinance debt at lower APRs. Speaking wistfully about one particular “wild bash” in 1978, Maclin smiled as he recalled how a packed dance floor erupted into a frenzy when a 19-year-old Chase teller “grabbed the mic” and started holding forth on loan modification provisions while DJ Jazzy Jay spun stripped-down electro-funk breaks. “Everyone was out there doing their thing, whether it was boogieing, performing transactions, investing their money, or opening checking accounts,” said Maclin, recalling the hours sitting on stoops with friends and developing dope ways to increase dividends. “I still remember giving out my first loan at a house party to Grandmaster Flash.” “You can still see early hip-hop’s influence on some of Chase’s more recent CDs,” Maclin added. Maclin reportedly expressed a feeling of longing for an earlier time when hip-hop was in its infancy, Chase was just starting out, and financial executives were “banking from the heart.” Maclin admitted that Chase had lost touch with its hip-hop roots over the years, claiming that the bank, with more than 5,100 branches and 16,100 ATMs in the U.S., became “totally corporate” and sold out. Chase president Jamie Dimon told reporters that the formative years of hip-hop were a period when the bank was “really tearing shit up.” According to Dimon, Chase was heavily influenced by ancient tribal money lending and often sampled the policies of innovative German banks from Dusseldorf. “That whole period was a renaissance, and I still have vivid memories of coming home late from bank parties where we’d have Kool Herc spinning in the lobby,” Dimon said. “Then I’d spend all night digging through this massive collection of financial records and doing some revolutionary underwriting.” “There was a lot of energy in the community and everybody was there, like Bank of America, First Federal, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Crash Crew, Bank One Corp., and the Fly Five,” added Dimon. “PNC and Washington Mutual were always hanging around, too, before they ended up going off to the West Coast.” While Dimon confirmed that Chase played an integral role in hip-hop’s “anything goes, party atmosphere,” the executive said that banking was the only way out of “the hood” for many young financial professionals. “It was a tough place, and the cops wouldn’t even go there, but banking provided hope for a lot of our clerks and loan officers who came from violent street gangs,” Dimon said. “Nobody thought a financial institution could come from the ghetto. And banking in Manhattan didn’t even happen until they found out we were making money doing it in the Bronx.” Afrika Bambaataa, who is widely regarded as the grandfather of hip-hop culture, was sentimental while discussing Chase’s role in the evolution of hip-hop, admiring how the bank developed talent and created unconventional amortized loans and groundbreaking transaction fees that forever transformed the financial and artistic movement. “Chase would always come straight with it,” Bambaataa said. “Didn’t matter if they were issuing traditional IRAs or a home equity line of credit.” “A lot of hip-hop trailblazers came out of the Chase crew,” added Bambaataa. “Duke Bootee, Willard C. Butcher, Melle Mel—all started out at Chase. They always had the best graffiti artists designing their deposit slips.

"NEW YORK—An estimated 80 billion tons of Jar Jar Binks-related merchandise—manufactured in bulk this spring in anticipation of the summer's blockbuster  prequel—is now available at as much as 70 percent off the regular retail price and could plummet even lower by week's end, according to a report issued Monday by the National Association of Toy & Novelty Retailers.
 ""Come on down, one and all, and get your special, ultra-rare collectibles featuring everybody's favorite bumbling orange space-frog, the incomparable Jar Jar Binks, surely one of the most enduring and beloved characters in the entire   pantheon,"" NATNR spokesman Jonathan Oglivie said. ""All across America, Jar Jar action figures, plush dolls, push-up pops, bedspreads, nightlights, play make-up heads, keychains, toothbrushes, mugs, mouse pads, bicycle helmets, TV-dinner trays, T-shirts, pajamas, coloring books, paint-by-number sets, jigsaw puzzles, glow-in-the-dark stickers, videogames, interactive read-along CD-ROM adventures, and pretty much anything else you can possibly imagine are available at low, low prices that anyone in the universe can afford.""
 Oglivie said the savings are part of a ""very special, limited-time offer"" available ""only until we can somehow clear all this stuff off the shelves."" He also noted that the estimated 850 billion cubic feet of cardboard-backed, plastic-wrapped Jar Jar merchandise is available ""wherever virtually anything is sold.""
 Monday's report comes in response to what industry insiders are calling ""a shelf-space crisis of unimaginable proportions"" that has resulted in ""giant piles of Jar Jar detritus as much as several stories high"" in parking lots across the nation. Toy stores, gas stations and supermarkets everywhere are choked with items bearing the image of the omnipresent, mischief-making Gungan amphibian.
 To deal with the massive overspill of goods, many retailers are offering a ""bucket of Jar Jar"" deal, in which customers who bring their own trashbag can take away ""as much Jar Jar crap as they can carry"" for a nominal fee, often one dollar or less.
 ""Not only is this clearance sale a chance to buy some terrific   merchandise at a great price,"" said Ames, IA, ShopKo manager Benjamin Reuss, ""but it will also help fulfill the legal requirement that I clear a reasonable pathway to the fire exits before the fire inspector returns next Thursday.""
 ""Let's face it: America is in the grip of a Jar Jar glut that has virtually paralyzed the nation,"" said sales-industry analyst Richard Januscz. ""Almost anywhere you go in this country, there is a life-size stand-up cardboard cutout of Jar Jar Binks staring at you, extending a helpful hand toward the soft-drink dispenser, his grinning face seeming to say, 'Wah-nah so-dah?' He is inescapable. Something must be done immediately.""
 A spokesman for Lucasfilm said the enormous discounts represent ""a fantastic opportunity"" for  fans, noting that Jar Jar is a fun, adorable character who is loved by children of all ages.
 ""Who doesn't love Jar Jar, with his clumsy, side-splitting antics, adorable pidgin-English speech patterns, and hilarious Muppety voice?"" asked Lucasfilm vice-president of licensing Joseph Gaer. ""As George Lucas himself has repeatedly stated, the creation of Jar Jar Binks is his single greatest accomplishment in  , the aspect of the film he's most proud of, because Jar Jar is the first completely digital character ever to appear in a major motion picture. Right?""
 ""Right?"" added Gaer, wiping his brow. ""Is anybody with me on this one? Hello?""
 With the Jar Jar crisis mounting, the federal government has stepped in, urging citizens to ""do their part"" by purchasing at least one Jar Jar item. Citizens are also encouraged to stay indoors and use major business-district thoroughfares only if absolutely necessary.
 Should the Jar Jar surplus reach disaster levels, the National Guard is poised to begin transporting the accumulated products to special ""Emergency Jar Jar Storage Silos"" in northern Nevada, where they will be kept until buyers can be found. If significant tonnage remains after these measures have been taken, the Jar Jar items will likely be recycled for use as building materials by Third World nations or, if necessary, as solid fuel.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to aid and inform local residents ahead of next year’s presidential election, officials at urban polling centers across the nation recommended Thursday that those intending to cast ballots in 2016 should begin lining up now. “Most polling locations will close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 8, 2016, so in order to ensure you have enough time to cast your vote, we suggest looking up your precinct online and planning to arrive sometime in the next few minutes,” Federal Election Commission spokesperson Judith Ingram said in a statement, noting that voters should be prepared for lines at inner-city polling locations that may back up as many as 12,000 or 13,000 hours. “If possible, we suggest notifying your employer that you need to take some months off from your job, or arrange to leave early from work this afternoon and return after the election is over.” Officials added that those urban residents unable to vote in person should file an absentee ballot every week for the next 18 months in case the first few dozen become lost in the mail.

"BEIRUT, LEBANON—As the cost of rocket fuel soared to $630 per gallon Monday, Middle Easterners who depend on the non-renewable propellant to power 10-kilogram rockets have been forced to severely restrict their daily bombing routines, bringing this latest round of fighting to an unexpected halt. ""The way things are going, I won’t have any money left over for other necessities, such as anti-aircraft missiles, land mines, and machine guns,"" said Hezbollah guerrilla Mahmoud Hamoui, who is just one of hundreds of Islamic militants compelled to scale back their killing until rocket-fuel prices return to their pre-2006 levels.  Regions in southern Lebanon and northern Israel, once bursting with the sounds of exploding rockets and air attacks, now lay eerily silent. Even the Gaza Strip, another scene of turmoil, is enduring an unsettling calm.  Since the start of this year, the average Palestinian and Lebanese militant’s rocket-fuel consumption has surged from three gallons to 22 gallons per week—second only to Cape Canaveral, FL in propellant consumption.  Experts have warned for months that factors including Hezbollah’s insatiable demand for larger rockets, the increased dependence on gas-guzzling car bombs, and the war in the Middle East would all drive up demand for rocket fuel while putting a severe strain on its supply. However, most ignored the threat, finding it difficult to change their way of life. ""I admit I had grown accustomed to waking up every morning, driving my multiple-rocket-launcher to the launching site, and firing one unguided Katyusha rocket after another, even when it wasn’t absolutely necessary,"" Lebanese militia member Omar Cheaib said. ""But at these prices, I can’t even afford short-range launches over the border. I don’t know what to do with myself."" Added Cheaib: ""I only hope our leaders do something soon to get life back to normal."" The shortage has also resulted in long lines at military fuel dumps, frustrating citizens trying to purchase as much rocket fuel as they can before prices climb even higher. At a Hezbollah installation outside Sidon, dozens of guerrillas slowly rolled Katyusha rockets in the direction of a holding tank containing the precious propellant.  ""I waited for two hours to fill up my Qassam-2 rocket yesterday, and I could only afford half a tank,"" said Hezbollah militant Amin Hammoud, who admitted to siphoning fuel from other rockets in his neighborhood. ""Do you know how fast a Qassam-2 burns through half a tank of rocket fuel? Even if I launched it from An Naqurah, it still wouldn’t make the trip to Nahariyya."" ""It’s sad, but the only thing that’s blowing up right now is prices,"" Hammoud added. The increase in fuel costs has even prompted the much more powerful Israeli military to suspend wider-scale rocket attacks on public places and completely cut out orphanage bombings, relying instead on targeted precision attacks that kill only seven or eight people at a time. Experts said that had Mideast citizens made a more conscious effort to reduce their daily bombings by the recommended 15 percent last year, they would still be able to affordably wage war today.  ""A helpful list of rocket-fuel-conservation tips was issued by the Lebanese government in early June, but it was virtually ignored,"" Beirut Arab University environmental studies Professor Farid Issa said. ""It suggested taking public transportation to the border to launch missiles, or simply gunning down Israelis with AK-47s. Instead, Hezbollah members chose to fire rockets from the convenience of their own backyards, as if rocket fuel grew on trees."" The unexpected jump in prices has many Islamic militants asking themselves for the first time whether the price they pay for rocket fuel is worth the price further paid by a handful of Zionists.  ""The possibility that the world may run out of rocket fuel has left us radicals wondering if our children, or our children’s children, will enjoy the same level of militancy,"" said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who feared that if the crisis continues, it could eventually spell the restoration of Middle Eastern infrastructure and prosperity, renewed relations with neighboring countries, and a ""worst-case-scenario peace gridlock."" ""Now the question becomes: What can we do to prevent this from ever happening?"" Nasrallah said. ""None of us want to live in a world in which we have to give up driving Israel into the sea, but we must face reality."" According to reports, Hezbollah is considering investing in an experimental new technology, still in its theoretical stages, that uses the clean-burning, inexpensive, yet highly combustible element hydrogen.

"PLEASANT, OH—Lucky second-grader Donny White, 7, enjoyed the thrill of a lifetime Monday, when a full-scale emergency evacuation of his small southern Ohio town was ordered following what EPA officials are calling one of the most disastrous toxic-chemical spills in U.S. history. White, who reportedly giggled and clapped his hands with glee during his big adventure, was relocated along with 15,000 other Pleasant residents after a transport train derailed while pulling into the loading dock of a Global Tetrahedron chemical plant near the town's perimeter, colliding with the facility. The impact ruptured three of the building's five massive storage tanks, releasing an estimated 3.5 million cubic feet of concentrated Zardozichlorate-3 gas into the surrounding countryside. ""It was so fun!"" the wide-eyed White said of his potentially fatal exposure to the toxic substance, which killed nearly $200 million in crops and livestock in a 20-mile-wide area downwind of the accident site. ""We got to get out of school, and there was helicopters, and then we got to ride in an Army truck to go see Mommy and Daddy!"" Zardozichlorate-3, a synthetic chemical with both military and industrial applications, kills within seconds in concentrations above .002 parts per million. Spokespersons for Global Tetrahedron have denied any liability for the accident and are citing human error on the part of the train's crew as the cause of the deadly spill. ""The Army man even let me see his gun,"" said White, barely able to contain his excitement. ""And there were these space-guys in shiny silver suits, with moon boots and masks like Darth Vader, and they ran around grabbing up all the kids and throwing them in the back of the Army trucks really fast!"" ""Wheeeeee!"" he added. White's big day began after Pleasant Elementary School authorities found him and several classmates playing in what they described as ""a big glowing mist that came down out of the sky"" during recess in the school playground. Almost immediately, National Guard helicopters, mobilized just minutes prior by Ohio governor Bob Taft, arrived on the scene. Soldiers informed everyone that the school was in the path of an ""airborne toxic event"" and ordered its evacuation. ""I had so much fun!"" White told reporters. ""I never saw a helicopter before except on TV. I counted four, just at our school. They made so much noise I had to cover my ears! It was awesome!"" As the adventure continued, White, along with several thousand others in the path of the quarter-mile-wide toxic cloud, were escorted by national guardsmen to a temporary civilian encampment and toxic-risk-assessment facility, which had been hastily assembled by emergency-response teams in the gymnasium of Abraham Lincoln Middle School in Crystal Rivers, approximately 35 miles away. ""I never slept in a gym before,"" said White, who received his ""very own cot."" ""It was just like Bible camp, only bigger! Everybody from the whole town was there: the baker-man, the mail lady… even Old Widow Shanahan and Pastor James!"" At the encampment, everyone who had been exposed to the toxin was placed under immediate quarantine and given a battery of tests to determine their exact level of exposure. Individuals determined to be at the highest risk received a series of emergency injections and treatments, which medical authorities hope will minimize the potential effects of exposure, which include difficulty breathing, pancreatic dysfunction and long-term damage to the nervous system. Because of his direct exposure to danger-level concentrations of the toxin, White was given what he called ""extra-special treatment"" at the emergency bivouac. He was permitted to skip ahead in line, go behind the ""emergency personnel only"" barricades, and talk directly to medical response teams—privileges the other children were denied. ""There were all these big shiny machines, like in  ,"" White said. ""And I got to lie down in this one really cool one that spins around upside down, so the doctors could check my brain. It was the best! Timmy and Jessica didn't even get to ride on it, but I did because I was in the special red-wristband group!"" In addition to his special ""maximum-toxicity risk"" wristband, White received a cookie, juice, a baseball, a catcher's mitt, a massive dose of anesthetics and a special radioactive dye, which was injected into his tiny skull. ""All the nice doctors and nurses said I was at the top of their list,"" White said. ""Of all the kids there, I was the one they paid the most attention to."" After passing through detoxification, White was given a series of injections hoped to neutralize the traces of Zardozichlorate-3 in his bloodstream, shots he claimed ""didn't hurt a bit."" He was then reunited with his parents in the main area of the gymnasium, where he played Wiffle ball with friends and got to sleep in a special Army-issue sleeping bag while waiting for EPA clearance to return home. ""I had the best time ever,"" White said. ""It was lots better than when we went to visit Grandma in Idaho. Everything was great except for when Mommy was crying. But I didn't cry. I wasn't a fraidycat, I was brave!"" The cloud dispersed within 72 hours, bringing White's funtime to a close. ""I was sad to leave,"" he said, ""but maybe, if I wish really hard, there will be another tog-sick vent someday, and we can all come back and do it again!"" Doctors said that despite White's direct exposure to Zardozichlorinate, there is ""a strong chance"" he will not develop a degenerative nerve disorder. ""He's shown no symptoms as of this time,"" said Col. Matheson Hardaway of the U.S. Army Medical Corps. ""That's a good sign considering the fact that all the livestock we examined seemed to have died within seconds."" Should he survive into adulthood, White, inspired by his experience, said he wants to become an emergency rescue worker. ""Either that, or else I'll be a scuba diver,"" the smiling child said, ""and swim under the sea, like Aquaman!"" ",1,Seven-Year-Old Enjoys Fun Toxic-Spill Evacuation

"BALTIMORE—A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found a link between the consumption of dog urine and the decreased likelihood of heart attacks, team leaders announced Tuesday in cracking, uneven voices. ""Our research indicates that by drinking six to eight glasses of fresh dog urine per day, individuals can reduce the risk of cardiac arrest by as much as 70 percent,"" said Dr. Arnold Minton, covering his mouth with his hand. ""This abundantly available material contains magical cardio-fluxo-medicines that strengthen the heart's mitral chambers and help keep its four aortic corridors clear of toxins and other such harmful substances."" Apologizing for his occasional laughter and explaining that the morning's  comic strip was ""really funny,"" team member Dr. Dinesh Patel explained the origins of the six-hour study. ""I noticed that my dog had never had a heart attack, and I'd never heard of a dog having a heart attack, so I realized that there is what scientists call 'a cause-effect phenomenon' at work here,"" Patel said. ""Well, it turned out it's their urine."" Patel then ran from the podium. After being pushed to the microphone by Minton, Dr. Leonard Weiscz outlined the team's recommendations for those wishing to diminish their chance of a potentially deadly myocardial infarction: ""Get yourself a dog, ideally a Labrador retriever, as the pH level is optimal in this particular breed, and then train it to urinate into a bucket,"" Weiscz said. ""Then, when the bucket is three-quarters to four-quarters full, lift it to your mouth and chug as quickly as you can."" Weiscz then stepped down from the podium ""to examine [his] notes."" Minton said a more convenient form of the active ingredients in dog urine will likely one day be synthesized for an over-the-counter medication, but he stressed that such a breakthrough is at least 10 to 15 years down the road. ""For now, you need a dog—excuse me a moment,"" said Minton, doubling over and inhaling sharply. ""And a bucket."" According to the Johns Hopkins team, for maximum effectiveness, the urine should not be mixed with any other substance. ""Drink it straight,"" said Weiscz, wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. ""Don't mix it with anything, not even water."" The group then called for a short break in the press conference. Returning after five minutes with somber faces, the scientists revealed more of their findings, including their suggestion that the urine be consumed ""right out in public."" ""It's also important to yell out, 'Ah, that's some tasty dog pee!' as soon as you're done,"" said Minton, his chest visibly shaking. ""I should know. I'm a trained medical professional."" Turning to the panel of scientists behind him, Minton shouted, ""Shut up, you guys!"" Upon the conclusion of Minton's remarks, the floor was opened to questions. The first came from  reporter Ken Coultier, who asked the researchers to discuss their own dog-urine-consumption habits. ""I wouldn't drink dog piss,"" Patel responded. Coultier then asked the researcher to explain why, if urine reduces the risk of heart attacks, he would choose not to follow his own advice. ""I don't have to drink it,"" Patel said. ""I'm not in a high-risk group."" ""Why don't  drink some?"" added Patel before calling for an end to the question-and-answer session. Tuesday's announcement is believed to be the most significant medical breakthrough from the Johns Hopkins team since its 1997 discovery that a grape stuffed in the left nostril for 48 hours will lower blood pressure by 30 percent.

"NEW YORK—The 2008 Stackley Cup Playoffs, a set of odd-number-of-games series that will determine the champion of the National Huckie League, are well underway, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman confirmed Monday.  At press time, the four hackley teams in contention for the Stickleby Cup were the Detroit Red Wings, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Pittsburgh Flyers, and a team from Dallas, TX. The Red Wings, one of the NHL's Original Four Teams, and the Penguins, who feature one of hinky's rising young stars in Sidney Crossberry, are leading their respective series and are expected to advance to the championship round, or Storkaley Cup Finallys. Hucklebee, which is played on ice by stick-wielding six-man teams who attempt to strike the hokey puck or ""ball"" into the opposing goal, is naturally a cold-weather sport. For this reason, hooky is believed to have originated in Canada. This will be the first year since 2003 that no Canadian team will make it to the Shaklee Cup Finals, and no Canadian team has won the Cup since 2003. ""This is the best time of year to watch the great sport of [huncky],"" Commissioner Bettman said in a statement released by the NHL public relations department. ""We still believe that our game is the fastest, toughest, most exciting game in the world, and we look forward to demonstrating that to a national audience as we determine the 2008 NHL Champion."" However, despite a fiercely loyal core fanbase, achieving mass popularity has been difficult for the National Honky League, which currently ranks behind the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, MLB, college football, NCAA basketball, tournament poker, and figure skating in television viewers. The sport, while definitely colorful, is somewhat difficult to watch on television; many say the fast action is actually too hard to follow, as they are unsure where the hanky puck is at any given time. The sheer number of games is also somewhat intimidating; the NHL season is believed to have actually began sometime last year. The sport was also dealt a rather ugly setback with many viewers during last year's Stanbly Cup playoffs when two players dropped their ice bats and gloves and became involved in a shamefully brutal fistfight. However, the passion of the teams involved in the Stagolee Cup Playups is impossible to deny or ignore. ""Way back when I was a kid playing on frozen ponds, I dreamed of winning the Cup,"" Detroit's Brian Rafalski told reporters Tuesday. ""It's every player's dream to hoist the Cup above their heads and have their name engraved on the side.""  One of the grand traditions of the sport is that each hicky player from the Cup-winning team is allowed to take the trophy with them for a day to show their families, friends, and presumably even coworkers at their actual jobs. ""Winning the Cup would be the ultimate dream come true for me, the reward for a very long, hard struggle,"" said foreign-born Penguins player Alexander Ovechkin, who, like most hochuli players, has based his life around the sport and has no real-world skills. ""But really, just to play this game, to be part of something that brings so many people joy, that has been a great gift as well."" Horklee is presumably extremely popular in Ovetchkin's home country.  ""Our dream is that, when the Stanley [sic] Cup Finals end in June, everyone in America has seen those games and realized how much fun it is to watch the NHL,"" Commissioner Bettman said. ""These are, without a doubt, some of the world's finest athletes playing in some of the world's most competitive games. I know I'm prejudiced, but I honestly think that anyone who watches will agree that hockey [sic] is the greatest sport in the world."" ",1,Stackley Cup Playoffs Underway

"WASHINGTON—Expanding their collection in an effort to obscure even more information about the nation’s past, representatives for the Museum of Repressed American History confirmed Thursday that they have concealed a new exhibit on the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. According to curators at the country’s foremost museum for the suppression of information regarding controversial aspects of U.S. history, the exhibit titled “The Tuskegee ███████: ███ █████” will boast the world’s largest collection of redacted documents, blurred-out video footage, and fully censored firsthand accounts on the topic. “Our mission has always been to present an easy-to-understand, morally unambiguous version of American history, and we’re delighted to withhold all manner of information in this exciting new exhibit,” said museum director Mark Lanney, who gave reporters an exclusive first look at several frosted-glass displays housing a number of the exhibit’s unlabeled artifacts and face-down government records. “Now, visitors have the opportunity to learn that there was some kind of project or program that transpired in Alabama at some point in the 20th century, and nothing else.” “Provided they are able to locate the exhibit hall despite it not being labeled anywhere on our museum map, our guests will have extremely restricted access to our obfuscated presentation of this unspecified historical occurrence,” he continued. According to museum staff, the exhibit will feature an extensive gallery of extremely washed-out, overexposed photographs depicting the various individuals and locations purportedly associated with the Tuskegee study. In addition, sources said that a windowless, unlit reading room will display hundreds of pages of shredded correspondence and personal testimonials that may or may not have been relevant to the event in question. The museum will also reportedly host screenings of an exclusive documentary consisting of three out-of-context seconds of an interview with an unnamed physician before cutting to a 75-minute montage of Fourth of July parades and still images of servicemen raising the American flag. Lanney said that visitors will be able to purchase an audio guide for the exhibit, which will play snippets of barely discernible narration in a language other than that which was requested. Guided tours in which docents lead guests directly from the ticket counter to the museum’s exit will also reportedly be available to museum visitors. “Visitors can learn everything they need to know about Tuskegee and its legacy—which is essentially nothing—from this exhibit,” senior curator Bethany Osgood told reporters. “When patrons are hurried out the doors before our closing hours of 10:15 a.m., they will have gleaned the only facts that they need to know about this matter, which are that it occurred a long time ago and that there really isn’t much more to say on the subject.” “No more questions,” Osgood added. According to officials, the museum was founded by prominent historical revisionist Henry Fleming, who in 1968 donated his private collection of burned government papers concerning the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II. Since its unannounced opening, the gallery has featured such exhibits as a retrospective of the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad consisting solely of a toy electric train that circled around a locked box containing records of laborers’ working conditions, as well as a room devoted to the Trail of Tears that contained no doorways by which to enter. Officials predicted that the Tuskegee exhibit may prove to be among the museum’s most impressive entirely whitewashed attractions. In fact, several museum patrons told reporters that the new exhibit had provided them the unique opportunity to superficially engage with what they had no reason to doubt was the nation’s past. “Between viewing a completely bare wing that was about something called the Middle Passage, and the exhibit on My Lai that had handwritten pages taped over its plaques explaining how the mission was a civilian outreach initiative to help Vietnamese citizens, I had a great time today,” visitor Leslie Shields said. “I also really enjoyed the exhibit on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which turned out to be a single giant mural depicting the Founding Fathers signing the Declaration of Independence with ‘America The Beautiful’ playing in the background.”  “I learned so much,” she continued. “I’ve never felt more proud of my country.” ",1,Museum Of Repressed American History Conceals New Exhibit On Tuskegee Experiments
"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Following the release of an independent investigation implicating him in the New England Patriots’ ball-deflation scandal, quarterback Tom Brady held a press conference Thursday during which he staunchly denied all allegations while repeatedly referring to himself as the “Golden Boy.” “The Golden Boy would like to state right now, for the record, that at no time did the Golden Boy have any knowledge that team assistants were tampering with game balls,” said Brady, adding that, given the paramount importance of maintaining the game’s integrity, the Golden Boy would never, under any circumstances, seek an unfair advantage in order to win. “This investigation is obviously deeply flawed, and the Golden Boy looks forward to speaking to Commissioner Goodell so the Golden Boy can clear the Golden Boy’s name and focus on next season.” Brady reportedly ended the press conference by telling reporters that the Golden Boy will not be taking any questions and then promptly walked out of the room.

"NEW YORK—Marking the latest and most ambitious attempt to bring stability to the region, the United Nations announced Wednesday that every single person in the Middle East will receive his or her own sovereign nation as part of a historic 317,000,000-state solution. The broad and extensive compromise, which affects more than 3,000,000 square miles formerly occupied by the territories of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Yemen, Egypt, and Jordan, will reportedly draw over 750,000,000 new borders in what experts claim will help drastically curb sectarian violence. “Given the incredibly complex and volatile sociopolitical landscape throughout the Middle East, a 317,000,000-state solution is the only realistic means of achieving lasting peace,” said U.N. Security Council president Eugène-Richard Gasana, noting that the treaty was reached after lengthy negotiations, which brought together each of the more than 300,000,000 independent factions. “We are pleased to finally come to an agreement that will hopefully stabilize the entire region and adequately satisfy the demands of all parties.” “We are confident that with every man, woman, and child possessing his or her own autonomous area of sovereignty to run as he or she sees fit, we will avoid many of the conflicts that have plagued this part of the world for centuries and left countless dead,” Gasana added. “This is a bright new future for the Middle East.” According to U.N. officials, the newly demarcated Middle East now consists of 8,000,000 independent Jewish states, 4,000,000 independent Palestinian states, 112,000,000 Shi’ite Islamic republics, 156,000,000 Sunni Islamic republics, and 19,000,000 Kurdish nations, as well as approximately 18,000,000 territories that include various Christian, Bahá'í, Druze, Zoroastrian, and secular countries. According to reports, the treaty has largely been met with support from locals, with many praising the division of the region into nearly a third of a billion sovereign states as a practical and desperately needed solution after decades of ceaseless sectarian fighting. “Frankly, giving every Middle Eastern citizen a country of his or her own is long overdue,” 49-year-old Naseer Khalidi told reporters from his newly formed 400-square-foot independent state along the former West Bank, which is adjacent to nations populated by his wife and two children. “After such a long history of violence and discord, we now have a region that is fairly and evenly divided among all religious factions, ethnic groups, and individual inhabitants. Finally, we can all live without oppression.” The resolution, however, has not been without various complications, with the U.N. now struggling to accommodate its 317,000,183 member states, and the global economy still reportedly has yet to incorporate each of the 317,000,000 entirely new forms of currency. Reports also confirmed that several hundred of the new states in what was formerly northeast Saudi Arabia contain highly valuable oil reserves within their borders, with top officials in those nations having already received a number of diplomatic visits from the U.S. and Western Europe, sparking tensions with their tens of thousands of neighboring countries. “While this idea may work in theory, this is simply another shortsighted plan that will only further strain tensions in the region,” said 54-year-old former Syrian resident Ilyas al-Masry, adding that there have already been some hints of unrest between each of the 246 sovereign states within a 5,000-foot radius of his country. “How can we have stability and peace when more than 300,000,000 nations are inhabiting lands they have absolutely no right to occupy?” “As long as everyone respects my borders, there will be no issues,” al-Masry added. “But I am prepared to use force if there are any attempts to destabilize or infringe upon my nation.” At press time, reports confirmed the outbreak of more than 90,000,000 new wars across the region, with sources estimating the current death toll at approximately 700,000.

"WEST LAFAYETTE, IN—Despondent over a recent breakup with his longtime girlfriend, Purdue University graduate student Tim Mahaffey, 27, has been hitting the Nintendo GameCube ""pretty hard,"" roommates reported Monday. ""Tim's been trying to drown his sorrows in the Cube,"" roommate Darrell Lock said. ""He's always been into Nintendo, but it was under control. These days, though, you barely ever see him without a controller in his hand."" Mahaffey's downward spiral began on Dec. 14, when Brittany Pfafflin, his girlfriend of two years, ended their relationship. In the days following the split, Mahaffey's friends noticed him exhibiting a decreased interest in social activities and a corresponding rise in time spent with his GameCube. ""All he wants to do is bury himself in Super Smash Bros. and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,"" Lock said. ""He used to think of himself as a 'social' videogame player, confident that he could hit quit any time he wanted. But lately, he'll play one game after another, all night long without stopping. Doesn't he know how many other people it hurts? I have to teach a 9 a.m. discussion section."" Even more distressing, roommate Colin Thaler said, is Mahaffey's habit of lying to cover up his GameCube addiction. ""Whenever Darrell and I leave the apartment in the morning, Tim hangs back and makes up some excuse to stay in, like he has to find his keys or write a paper,"" Thaler said. ""But we know better. As soon as we're gone, he digs up one of the controllers he has hidden all over the apartment and lights up the TV."" During a recent conversation, Mahaffey gave Thaler the impression that he might finally be ready to start dating again. ""I took it as an encouraging sign when Tim said there was a girl who seemed interested in him,"" Thaler said. ""Eventually, I realized that he was talking about a character in the virtual town he created in Animal Crossing. He said her name was 'Jeanne.' I know he needs us to be there for him, but I almost started whaling on him."" Nintendo spokesman Michael Dean offered support to Mahaffey and others sharing his problem. ""Our prayers go out to the friends and family of Mr. Mahaffey, and to Mr. Mahaffey himself,"" Dean said. ""When used responsibly, the Nintendo GameCube is a refreshing and enjoyable way to unwind from the pressures of the day. It is not intended for abuse, as has been reported among a small percentage of our happy GameCube family. We hope Mr. Mahaffey can get the help he needs so he can once again lead a productive life that includes responsible playing of such forthcoming games as Dungeons & Dragons Heroes, Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Evolution Snowboarding.""

"LAWRENCE, KS—Chad Doogan, 20, a resident of the economically ravaged back bedroom at 1409 Oakwood Drive, received a huge setback Monday, when a humanitarian proposal calling for the forgiveness of his outstanding debts was vetoed by his two roommates. ""Look, I know Chad's snowed under a mountain of bills right now, but that's no reason for him to get off scot-free,"" said Doug Huygens, 22, one of the apartment's two superpowers. ""Chad's a good guy and all, but this is getting ridiculous. He's owed us a ton of money for months. Now he wants a free ride? I'm sorry, man, but that's bullshit."" According to Doogan, his large accumulated debt and his extremely low gross annual income have created a cycle of poverty that he can't escape. ""Dude, I got to put at least $300 into my car to get that shitheap running again, or how else am I supposed to deliver pizza?"" the embattled Doogan said from his living-room couch, where he has spent the past two weeks. ""There's no way I can afford to do that and pay the back rent I owe, plus three months of cable bills and beer money. Plus, I still owe like $100 on the noise-complaint ticket we got from that spring-break party. How am I supposed to pay any of it back if I can't work at Pizza Pete's?"" Doogan and supporters of his debt-relief plan are calling for the immediate cancellation of 85 to 100 percent of his incurred debt. ""If the guys would forget about the money I owe them, or at least the back rent, I could fix my car and pick up a bunch of shifts,"" Doogan said. ""It's in their best interest. Not only could I stop begging them for rent, but I could also start chipping in for groceries and video games and all that."" Huygens and roommate Jake Epstein, 24, said they first provided Doogan with emergency funds last winter, when they granted him an aid package in the form of a no-interest loan obtained through the Apartmental Monetary Fund, founded by Huygens and Epstein in February 2004 at the behest of third-roommate advocacy groups, such as Doogan's buddies Dan ""Cosmo"" Richards and Douglas ""Scooter"" Pye. ""Cosmo and Scooter were all like, 'C'mon, Chad's a good guy, have a heart,'"" Epstein said. ""So finally, me and Doug were like, 'Okay, okay, we'll float him some cash, but only for a few weeks until he gets his shit together.' Well, you can see how great that worked out."" Although the donor roommates supplied additional aid in the months that followed, the AMF placed strict conditions on the loans. These conditions were designed to accomplish three goals: to prevent corruption and misuse of funds, to ensure that the monies were spent wisely, and to reduce third-roommate economic isolationism, integrating the debtor's personal economy more fully into the interdependent apartmental community. ""We only asked for three things, man,"" Huygens said regarding the structure of the loan. ""First, that Chad quit partying so much. Second, that he open a checking account so he can budget his cash. And third, that he bring his kickass stereo system out of his bedroom and into the living room where we can all enjoy it. It was only fair."" While Doogan initially accepted the terms, he later issued complaints that the conditions were unnecessarily restrictive. ""I'm sick of Doug and Jake looking over my shoulder every time I want to rent a DVD or buy a friggin' beer,"" Doogan said. ""Look, I'm sorry that I don't have a big allowance from my rich parents like they do. I wouldn't be asking the guys for money if they couldn't afford it."" Huygens and Epstein said Doogan failed to honor the conditions of the loan. ""Three days after we gave him this big loan, we came back from a weekend ski trip and the whole place was totally trashed,"" Huygens said. ""There were beer cans everywhere, food and chips and shit all over the floor, and the bathroom was a friggin' disaster."" The AMF imposed sanctions against Doogan immediately thereafter, refusing additional loans until the environmental damage stopped. But after loans failed to bring an end to the spiraling third-roommate debt, a more radical concept was introduced by an outspoken Chad advocate, Epstein's girlfriend Liz Borowitz. ""Liz was all over me about how I gotta be there for my buddy when he needs me,"" Epstein said. ""She's, like, this total softie who rescues cats and shit. So she comes up with the bright idea that me and Doug should just forgive all the loans and let Chad start over on an even playing field. I was like, 'I'm sorry, Liz, but there's no way in hell…'"" Added Epstein: ""Liz is super nice, but her idealist humanitarian policies are not financially sound. We set a dangerous precedent by bailing Chad out. It hardly motivates future roommates to be fiscally responsible, does it?"" Doogan implored Huygens and Epstein to reconsider their decision. ""How'm I supposed to better myself when all these forces are keeping me down?"" Doogan said. ""If I don't get out from under this debt, I can't pay tuition next semester and provide myself with an education. I'm under serious risk of reverting to living in my parents' basement, under their totalitarian regime. These dudes are my buddies—can't they see I'm the victim of macroeconomic forces I'm powerless to overcome? Jeez."" ",1,Housemates Reject Third-Roommate Debt-Relief Plan

"ALEXANDRIA, VA—A study published Thursday in   determined that it is highly detrimental to the physical and mental health of human beings for them to spend any more than five consecutive hours in each other’s company. “Our research shows that humans are not evolutionarily equipped to handle being together for extended periods of time, under any circumstances,” said the study’s lead author, Mark Hughson, adding that the findings applied equally to both casual acquaintances and immediate family members, including mothers and their newborn children. “We found that, optimally, people should limit themselves to between two and 20 minutes in another person’s company, with five hours representing the absolute maximum amount of time that anyone should allow themselves to be in the presence of others. In addition, they should permit at least three days to elapse in between human interactions, preferably a week. We simply weren’t constructed to put up with more than that.” Hughson went on to say that while humans had the capacity to withstand each other’s company in five-hour increments, it was ideal for them to isolate themselves permanently as early in life as possible.

"IOWA CITY, IA—University Of Iowa pre-law major Peter Kaufman announced Sunday that his roommate of two weeks, Rob Carrero, would be informally barred from cleaning the bathroom of their two-bedroom off-campus apartment, citing Carrero's general ineptitude at other household maintenance and the probability that he would ""leave it in worse shape than before he started."" ""I was all set to draw up a cleaning schedule when we moved in, but after seeing the way he washes the dishes, I think I'll just handle the bathroom myself from here on out,"" said Kaufman, 20. ""He would just do it wrong. I'm convinced of it.""  Although Kaufman admitted he was still getting to know Carrero, he found the 19-year-old engineering student's pan-scouring abilities during the first weekend of their cohabitation to be an indication of his housecleaning acumen. ""I can just envision the mildew colonies that would go untouched in the corners of the tub and between the shower tiles,"" Kaufman said. ""I'd go so far to say that he's the type of guy who thinks it's appropriate to use Windex on the tub instead of Formula 409."" According to Kaufman, Carrero approached him while he was cleaning the bathroom last Friday and asked if he needed any help. Kaufman declined and told him he was ""almost done anyway,"" after spotting a kitchen sponge in Carrero's hand. ""I don't know what he thought he was going to do with that,"" Kaufman said. ""That sponge is for dishes and dishes only. Even if we were to overlook how disgusting that proposition is, the kitchen sponge would also be completely ineffective. You need a plastic scrub brush, or a separate sponge with an abrasive side, although experience has told me the latter does an inferior job."" Added Kaufman: ""Rob's simply not cut out for this kind of responsibility."" Speculating that Carrero grew up in a household where his mother cleaned the bathroom, Kaufman ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Carrero also tried to clean the sink with paper towels and then discard the used ones in the toilet. ""A toilet bowl is not a trash can,"" said Kaufman, who added that if a clog occurred for this reason, Carrero would have to wait for the plumber, since Kaufman certainly would not. Carrero's handling of the recycling last weekend also gave Kaufman cause for concern. ""When I came home Sunday night, I inspected the bags he left in front of our building,"" Kaufman said. ""He had a  Dr. Pepper can in with the plastics. To me, that screams 'shaking out the bathroom mat over the tub, washing the floor with God-knows-what—probably hand soap—and putting the mat back down on the wet floor, creating a gigantic mold habitat.'"" Among other ""disgusting mistakes"" Kaufman predicted Carrero would make if given the chance: failing to clean the ""often overlooked"" area between the toilet and lid hinges, cleaning ""around"" the shampoo and conditioner bottles on the rim of the tub rather than taking the time to lift them up and remove the rings of soap scum underneath, and breaking two shower-curtain rings off the support rod after stepping on the bottom of the curtain with shoes while cleaning the tub. According to Carrero, Kaufman is ""really possessive of the bathroom."" ""A few times already, Peter's gone off about 'toothpaste speckles' on the mirror, something called a 'grout,' and the 'grime and saliva' that he has to bleach out of our toothbrush-holding cup,"" Carrero said. ""It's a little odd, but whatever. I'd offer to help him out again, but I don't want to get in his way."" ",1,Roommate Deemed Too Incompetent To Clean Bathroom
"DAYTON, OH—University of Dayton sophomores Mike Maritz and Andrea Haltigan reported Monday that their otherwise normal-seeming new roommate has ""this whole theory about how Kenny Rogers is a genius.""
 ""So, yesterday, we're moving the living room around to fit in some of Kurt [Schaier]'s stuff,"" said Maritz, 21. ""The two of us are pushing my big CD shelf into the corner, and out of nowhere, Kurt says, 'Kenny Rogers is the most underrated musician alive.' I was like, 'Where did that come from?'""
 According to Maritz, Schaier spent the next 25 minutes elaborating on his bold assertion, discussing Rogers' pre-solo days with The First Edition, his duets with Dottie West, and his 1977-80 ""Golden Era."" Later that evening, Schaier returned to the subject twice more, once to offer a line-by-line analysis of the lyrics to ""Coward Of The County"" and once to declare the 1968 First Edition hit ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" a ""true pop-psychedelic classic.""
 Haltigan and Maritz first met Schaier on March 14 when he responded to a classified ad for the vacant room in their three-bedroom apartment. 
 ""We said no to a few applicants, like this guy with these earlobe things and this one creepy engineering guy, but Kurt seemed totally normal,"" said Haltigan. ""He's a poli-sci major, he has a great DVD collection, and he's into painting, which is all cool. Where the Kenny Rogers-is-a-god thing comes from, I have no idea.""
 According to Haltigan, Schaier made no Rogers-related remarks during his first two days in the apartment.
 ""The first 48 hours were fine, but then on day three, completely out of nowhere, the Kenny Rogers floodgates opened wide,"" Haltigan said. ""That's when Kurt told me that Kenny Rogers straddles—actually, the exact phrase was  —the line between contemporary pop and classic country, yet everyone unfairly dismisses him as a lightweight because he has strong appeal with the easy-listening crowd.""
 Added Haltigan: ""He also said Kenny Rogers is 'long overdue for the sort of critical reappraisal that Burt Bacharach has enjoyed of late.' Who says shit like that?""
 While Haltigan and Maritz have nothing against Rogers, they told Schaier they do not consider him to be in the same league as such country legends as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Willie Nelson. Schaier countered that Rogers ""transcends the country label,"" asserting that he is ""not so much a country singer as a spiritual descendant of the master songsmiths of Tin Pan Alley and The Brill Building.""
 ""Kurt said that if Kenny Rogers wanted to, he could limit himself to just country, but he wants to create accessible music,"" Maritz said. ""Kurt said that's like criticizing a filmmaker for not working in paint on a canvas. Kurt also said… well, Kurt said a lot.""
 In his efforts to demonstrate the breadth and depth of Rogers' music, Schaier cited a partial list of the artists with whom he has worked.
 ""At one point, Kurt practically followed me into the bathroom,"" Maritz said. ""I'm trying take a piss, and he's outside the door saying, 'Dolly Parton, Coolio… Sheena Easton, Ray Parker Jr., Olivia Newton-John… Madonna… The Charlie Daniels Band.'""
 Discussing Schaier while he was at class Monday, Haltigan and Maritz raised a number of questions about their new roommate: How long has Schaier been a Kenny Rogers fan? Does he actually listen to Kenny Rogers albums, or is his fandom primarily conceptual? Is Kenny Rogers genuinely of great importance to Schaier, or is Schaier merely a hipster contrarian with countless other, similarly irritating pop-culture theories at his disposal?
 ""I've known tons of guys who say shit like, '  was the best film of 2001,' just to provoke outrage,"" Maritz said. ""But so far with Kurt, it's only been Kenny Rogers, so I'm not sure if he's one of those.""
 Continued Maritz: ""Then there are those guys who randomly pull ridiculous shit out of their asses—for example that, um, every Ron Howard film is based on a different Shakespeare play—just to see if they can somehow prove it. Maybe that's his deal. Then again, maybe he's just a normal guy who happens to like really shitty music.""
 Noted psychologist and author Dr. Terrence Paul agreed that it remains too soon to tell.
 ""Mike and Andrea do not yet know enough about Kurt to determine whether his statements are driven by a genuine love of Kenny Rogers, a desire for acceptance, a desire to annoy, or some combination of the three,"" Paul said. ""At this juncture, they still can't be certain to what extent they should dread the upcoming lease year.""

""I need a couple of his traditional nomad outfits for this sheikh-themed party I'm throwing. And those uniforms with all the medals are pretty sweet."" According to sources, Biden was unable to lay claim to Qaddafi's Bedouin tents because Energy Secretary Steven Chu had called them minutes earlier. ",1,Biden Calls Dibs On Qaddafi's Clothes

"Christ almighty, here we go again. Just when I think I can finally get in a good night's sleep, those upstairs neighbors of mine start silently going to town on each other again like a couple of goddamn cats in heat, I imagine. It's like, take a day off, you two! How can they possibly have the energy to inaudibly screw the living bejeezus out of each other every single night in every conceivable position until the sun comes up, as I am assuming they must do? Really, to ceaselessly and without making a sound indulge in a veritable cornucopia of unimaginably debauched carnal pleasures for hours on end for all I know because I have no actual evidence—it's just not normal! And to think, after months and months and months of this, they have the nerve to look confused and frightened when I glare at them in the hallway and say, ""Have fun, perverts."" Now don't get me wrong, I firmly believe in ""live and let live,"" and I'm not some prude who gets offended by people having intimate relations with one another. That's their business. But to keep me awake half the night with the kinky filth that I am for no real reason convinced is quietly happening up there is just plain inconsiderate. Sometimes I have the feeling that they're getting so out of hand that I'm forced to bang on the ceiling with a broom handle until one of them finally shouts, ""Knock it off, you psycho! We're trying to sleep!"" Yeah, nice try. I know what I graphically imagine you're really doing up there. Boy, assuming they're home at all, tonight is even worse than the time I presumed they were having a totally soundless orgy. I couldn't stop tossing and turning with all of that silent, oiled-up writhing and partner-swapping that was no doubt going on up there, if I had to guess. Just the completely groundless thought of those naked, sweat-slickened sickos taking that many drugs and doing God knows what to each other with hundreds of high- end, whisper-quiet, German-manufactured sex toys—it's disgusting. What I'd really like to know is how those four dozen people I didn't even hear come up the stairs are able to live with the apparently inaudible, deviant versions of themselves I've mentally conjured up. In any case, that whole fiasco was almost enough to make me long for the days when, without either of those two degenerates making so much as a peep, she was most likely stepping really hard right on his genitals with a dirty, 16-inch leather stiletto boot and then making him lick the whole damned thing clean! Well, enough is enough. If I'm going to continue to suppose that the two of them insist on nightly fulfilling their every noiseless, twisted sexual fantasy, then something's got to be done. There's no other way around it: I'm going to have to strip naked, cover myself in cake batter, march right up there, kick the door in, and start paddling myself bloody with a wooden pizza peel while screaming, ""How do you like it, huh?! How do you like this, Mrs. Regina!"" over and over again. It's the only solution. And after that, I'll have to do something about those downstairs neighbors who are always jumping up and down on their bed in the middle of the night and screaming.

"BURLINGTON, VT–The deal with that guy on the living-room couch was finally revealed Sunday, when University of Vermont junior Chris Bogen, 20, informed roommate Derek Thatcher, 19, that the dude was a friend from out of town.
 At approximately 2 p.m., Bogen, who had slept way late after a night of hard partying, woke up and identified the individual on the couch as ""Ryan from Stowe,"" this guy he used to work with like two or three summers ago. Bogen said he would have mentioned to Thatcher that the guy would be crashing at their apartment, but he had been clueless himself until the guy showed up from out of nowhere at around 9 the night before. ""We used to park cars together–I think it was summer of '96,"" said Bogen, who noted that he hadn't thought about the guy in forever. ""He was in town, so he stopped by to say hi. The dude said he was planning to drive back to Stowe last night, but we spent all night out at the bars, so he wound up sacking out on the couch.""
 Thatcher, who had had a shitty time at work Sunday night, said he went to bed before anyone came home that evening and was, as a result, unaware of the presence of the guy on the couch until 10 the next morning. ""I had just gotten up and was on my way to take a piss, when I saw something on the couch,"" Thatcher said. ""Upon closer inspection, I was like, 'Holy shit, some dude's there sleeping.'""
 Thatcher said he theorized that the dude must have been a buddy of Bogen's, as third roommate Josh Friesz was out of town with his girlfriend for the entire weekend. At one point, he leaned over the sleeping guy in an effort to get a better look at his face, which was shielded against the sunlight with his forearm. Thatcher also studied the height of the individual and concluded that the guy was way too tall to be Lee, Juan or Skeeter, friends of the roommates who likely were up late partying with Bogen the previous evening.
 Still uncertain of the sleeping guy's identity, Thatcher noticed a pack of menthol cigarettes and a newly purchased Medeski Martin & Wood CD still in its plastic wrapper on the floor next to the couch. Thatcher said he knew the items did not belong to anyone in the house and must have belonged to the guy, whoever the hell he was. ""None of us smoke menthols, and I know for a fact that Chris and Josh both already have that CD,"" Thatcher said. ""I was like, 'Who  this guy?'""
 Out of consideration for the unidentified sleeping guy, Thatcher remained in the kitchen while eating breakfast to ensure that the crunching of his Count Chocula would not disturb the dude.
 ""Weekends, I usually like to watch TV while I eat my cereal, but I just hung back in the kitchen,"" he said. ""I didn't know the guy, but he looked pretty wiped, so I wanted to give him the chance to sleep as late as possible. I've been on the other end of that stick on more than a few occasions, let me tell you, so I try to return the courtesy whenever possible.""
 Upon finally learning the identity of the guy, Thatcher assured Bogen that it was no big deal, noting that just three weeks prior, his own friend Bryan crashed on the couch while his apartment was being sprayed for roaches. Bogen responded by thanking Thatcher for his consideration big-time.
 After taking a shower and eating some Apple Jacks, Bogen went in and attempted to address the guy on the couch, saying, ""Dude, you don't gotta be anywhere today, do you?"" When the body barely rustled under the blanket, Bogen shrugged and turned on the TV to the Cartoon Network.
 Shortly before leaving to go to the campus library, Bogen told Thatcher not to worry about the dude, assuring him that the guy is cool and all, and that he won't touch any of Thatcher's shit. Bogen added that he would grab dinner with the guy later if he was still around.
 The guy on the couch, who must have let himself out sometime after Thatcher left for work at 4:30 p.m., could not be reached for comment. ",1,"Guy On Couch A Friend From Out Of Town, Roommate Reports"

"SAN JOSE, CA—In an alarming report that sheds new light on the dangers of the game, the Institute for Brain Injury Research published Wednesday the results of a five-year investigation into the long-term neurological consequences of playing   football. ""The situation is far more serious than we had previously thought,"" said Vincent Wu, head of neuropathology at the IBIR. ""Playing   football increases one's risk for a wide range of cognitive impairments, from difficulty focusing, to a decreased awareness of one's surroundings, to a generalized inability to engage with society at large."" ""Playing so many simulated seasons takes a devastating toll,"" Wu added. ""The human brain was never meant to withstand the brutal impacts of this game."" Examining MRIs and PET scans of   football veterans, scientists discovered severely damaged neural pathways in parts of the brain associated with motivation and attention, malformations that might explain the common inability among players to perform such basic tasks as maintaining hygiene and preparing meals for themselves. ""Among current top-level   players, the vast majority suffered from profound personality and mood disorders,"" said Annette Crowley, an IBIR research fellow. ""Our participants displayed irritability when presented with even the simplest commands—for example, to stand up from the couch or to interact with their own children for a while."" While cognitive deficiencies occurred among people who only played   football as youths and adolescents, the study showed an even grimmer outlook for those who continued playing the game into adulthood. ""Following a decade or more of intense play, these neurologically impaired individuals face incredible difficulty rejoining society,"" said Wu, who noted that a player's total game time was correlated with high levels of depression and an elevated body mass index. ""They realize too late that they have done irreversible harm to their brains and bodies, and that they have no real skills to offer the world."" ""It's all too common that they are forced to remain living with their parents for basic care,"" Wu added. According to the IBIR, nine former   football players have agreed to donate their brains to scientific research after their deaths. Among them is 34-year-old Matt Curtis, who played every season from  to . ""This game took everything from me,"" Curtis said. ""My fiancée left me, and I can't hold down a steady job. In college, I should have focused on my education instead of spending every waking minute playing the game. No one should end up like this."" In response to the study, EA Sports announced it would issue new safety guidelines for   and urged individuals to refrain from play, even in Training Camp mode, if they experience poor balance upon standing for the first time in several hours or increased sensitivity to natural light after emerging from a darkened bedroom or basement. However, many contend these recommendations fail to address what they call a pervasive culture within   football that ostracizes those who sit out games, particularly during online league play. ""Today's brand of   football is far different from the game of 20 years ago,"" said 34-year-old Dan Doyle, a former player turned safety advocate. ""The style of play is much faster and far more aggressive. After 16 weeks of punishing games, you can see it in the dazed, glassy looks in the players' eyes. It's like they're not even there."" ""These men—boys, really—have no idea what they're doing to themselves,"" he added. Despite initiatives to educate   football players about such dangers, surveys show a majority of players object to measures that would slow the game down or limit playing time for at-risk individuals. ""The reason   football has so many fans is precisely because of its nonstop hard-hitting action,"" said current player Jed Ashbee, 26. ""If you strip away the things that make the game so exhilarating, then all you're left with is Wii  , and nobody wants that.""

"HUNTSVILLE, AL–Jesus Christ, son of God and noted pro-life activist, killed two and critically wounded seven others when He opened fire in the waiting room of a Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday. 
 Security guards at the Women's Medical Clinic of Huntsville were able to disarm the Messiah before He could reload His weapon, a secondhand Glock 9mm pistol that authorities said He purchased legally at a Jackson, MS, sporting-goods store. ""Abortion is a sin,"" said Christ as He was led away in handcuffs. ""It is an abomination in the eyes of Me."" Witnesses said the attack, which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring, 51, and clinic nurse Danielle Costa, 29, came from ""out of nowhere.""
 ""He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring,"" receptionist Iris Reid said. ""The next thing I knew, He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving.""
 ""It was horrible,"" said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs, recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen. ""He put his hands over Dr. Woodring's head and told him He forgave him for his sins, and then He shot him right in the face."" Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room, where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe. Federal investigators are similarly baffled, saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in ""mysterious ways.""
 Speaking to reporters from His holding cell, Christ, 33, said He had ""no regrets"" about what He had done. 
 ""As I said in  , every life is precious,"" Christ said. ""This means every life, not just those who have already been born. My father, the Lord, feels the same way I do. In  , He said unto the prophet Jeremiah, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.' The unborn fetus is a sacred, living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such.""
 Added Christ: ""What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so. After all, it wasn't even her decision to conceive me in the first place. But in the end, she made the right decision, bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior. Blessed is she among women."" According to legal experts, if convicted, Christ could face the death penalty.
 ""The state of Alabama has the death penalty, and this crime is certainly the sort that would be construed as a capital offense,"" University of Michigan law professor Arthur Lipscomb said. ""With the right judge and jury, Christ could very well be put to death yet again."" In such a case, Lipscomb said, Alabama would likely use lethal injection rather than crucifixion. Christ said He is unafraid of the prospect of execution. ""Those who know me know that I am willing to die for the sins of others, whether those sins be avarice, slothfulness, false idolatry or the butchering of unborn life,"" Christ said. ""The bottom line is, abortion stops a beating heart."" Tuesday's shooting is not Christ's first brush with the law. On April 8, 29, He was arrested in the Roman province of Judea for alleged false claims to the throne of the Kingdom of Israel. On Jan. 11, 1996, He and six other pro-life activists were jailed for blocking the entrance to a Cheektowaga, NY, abortion clinic. In October 1997, He was arrested for plotting to mail anthrax-laced packages to two dozen abortion doctors across the U.S. ""Abortion is an abomination. It is a sin. It is murder,"" Christ said. ""I only did what any good Christian would have done."" Christ's followers have been overwhelmingly supportive of their leader.
 ""As it says in  , 'For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother's womb. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body,'"" said Ralph Anson of the Houston-based Every Life Is Precious. ""Those people at that clinic were killers, and they deserved to die."" ""We may not understand everything He does, but we must believe it is for the best,"" said Rev. Joseph Abernathy, minister at First United Baptist Church of Huntsville. ""As Christians, it is not our duty to question what our Savior does. We can only live according to His example.""

"I swear, my mom is  coolest. She's totally my best friend. If I'm stressed out about something, I can just call her, and she'll be like, ""Hey, what's up?"" and she'll just sit and  to me.
 When I'm with my mom, I can totally just be myself. I can tell her anything and she'll totally understand. It's like we have this bond or something.
 It's almost as if she's my sister, only better, since my sister Jessica and I totally hate each other.
 I can't even begin to tell you how important my mom has been throughout my life. Ever since I was young, she's totally been there for me. She should get an award for ""Mother Of The Year"" or something. I'm serious.
 She totally deserves it.
 When I first went away to college, we were both completely bawling. At first, I thought it would be hard to stay in touch, but you know what? We actually became closer! When I was in high school, sometimes we would get into fights about stupid stuff, but now that I'm out of the house, it's like we're both adults, and we can talk as total equals.
 I swear, I can talk to my mom about anything. Like, even though I'm not 21 yet, if I go out to the bars with some of my Alpha Chi Omega sisters and get totally drunk, I can tell my mom, and she's completely cool about it. Sometimes, she even tells me crazy stories about times she got drunk in her sorority days.
 My friends are so jealous of my relationship with my mom. They're like, ""I  believe you went to Cancun with your mom, and you can, like, talk to her about sex and stuff! I could  do that with my mom!"" That's how cool she is.
 My mom has been such an inspiration to me. I really look up to her, not just as a person, but as a woman. She's a lawyer and she has this huge office with really classy-looking furniture, and she has this assistant she makes hail cabs for her when it's raining. Plus, she still looks amazing even though she's 48. I always tell my mom that she's such a hottie! I hope I look half as good when I'm her age.
 If anyone asked me who I look up to most in the world, I would definitely say my mom and Meg Ryan. My mom has taught me so much, like that I can succeed in anything I want if I just put my mind to it. Isn't that just the best advice? You know, my mom is always willing to help me, too. When I forgot to register for Biology 201, she called up the dean and told him that with the tuition she pays, they'd better let me into that class. And you know what? They did! Besides being smart, my mom is so amazingly cool. She has incredible taste in cars and clothes. None of my friends would ever be able to trust their parents to pick out their college car. Well, my mom surprised me with an Isuzu Trooper! It's like we're on the same brainwave or something! And my mom and I can totally have fun together. Like last month, she came to visit me, and we got a room at the best hotel in town just so we could hang and de-stress after my midterms. We spent the whole afternoon shopping and getting makeovers at this awesome day spa.
 We've had a lot of fun times together, but she's totally helped me through some really rough spots, too. When Zach and I broke up, she was the one who helped me see that I was way too good for him.
 Oh! I totally forgot to mention one of the biggest reasons why my mom is the greatest mom in the whole universe. Not only is she is way into letting me borrow her stuff, we're the same shoe size! Isn't that just so cool? ",1,My Mom Is Totally My Best Friend

"NEW YORK—Thousands jumped off the Empire State Building Thursday as part of the famed skyscraper's 12th annual No-Hassle Suicide Day, during which anyone can take the iconic 86-story plunge without having to worry about being stopped, fined, or serving time in prison. Calling this year's event a ""resounding success,"" building officials said that once the final body had hit the pavement, No-Hassle Suicide Day 2011 would go down as the most well attended in history, with jumpers coming from all 50 states and all corners of the globe to take advantage of the lax building security and the New York City Police Department's promise not to talk anyone down. At press time, 18,755 people had jumped off the Empire State Building. ""For 364 days of the year, security on our observation deck is tight, and any person who threatens to jump is typically tackled and arrested before he gets a chance to climb our safety fence,"" building owner Anthony Malkin told reporters, while behind him as many as 15 bodies could be seen falling through the sky. ""But on the third Thursday of every June, we open up our doors, lower our guardrails, and let people jump—no questions asked—off one of the most famous buildings in all of the world."" ""So if you've lost your will to live and want the ultimate suicide experience, come on down to the historic Empire State Building,"" he added. ""Tickets are only $15."" Citing high unemployment, the recent wave of natural disasters, an increase in home foreclosures, and a general rise in population, city officials said they had expected a large turnout, but they hadn't expected such an international presence or having to extend jumping hours past 9 p.m. Sources confirmed that Wednesday night—nearly 14 hours before the first body careened onto Fifth Avenue—a line of despondent individuals began forming at the building's entrance, and by morning it stretched 15 city blocks. Jumpers were assured that the 86th floor observation deck would remain open even if wind conditions turned dangerous, and that they would have the option of falling onto the hood of a car for an extra $20. In addition, the skyscraper's metal detectors were reportedly removed in case anyone wanted to bring a gun and blow his brains out, whether on the elevator ride up or during the six-second trip down. ""I've been looking forward to this day for a while,"" said 42-year-old Kevin Washington, who added that he really didn't want to talk about why he was jumping off the Empire State Building but confirmed his plans to go through with it. ""I actually tried to jump off it about eight months ago, but I got caught and had to go through this whole mental evaluation thing. It was a real pain. I was told to come back on Suicide Day when it would be smooth sailing."" ""Well, looks like I'm up,"" he added. ""See ya."" Started in 2000, No-Hassle Suicide Day has quickly become a signature New York City experience. In addition to the thousands who leap to their deaths, even more enjoy the festivities by coming out to watch the barrage of falling bodies, buy an ""I Didn't Survive No- Hassle Suicide Day"" T-shirt, or eat a ""Suicide Dog,"" which is a hot dog with ketchup and hot sauce. In what has become one of the event's long-standing traditions, members of the clean-up crew often allow children to operate the power washers used to spray off the concrete after each set of 200 suicides. ""Normally we wouldn't allow it, but for an extra $100, a suicidal person can climb to the top of the building's spire and jump from there,"" said building superintendent Stephen Fitzpatrick, adding that ankle weights were also available for purchase in the gift shop. ""On No-Hassle Suicide Day, the motto around here is: No one can stop them but themselves."" ""This is just another way to celebrate all that New York City has to offer,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters. ""Typically I don't take part in the festivities. But I've basically done everything I can do as mayor, I'm not running for president, and as of late I've been asking myself, 'What's the point of all of this, anyway?'

"WASHINGTON, DC–According to a controversial Federal Trade Commission report released Tuesday, food manufacturer Hostess may have intentionally marketed ""Twinkies""–a dangerous snack cake linked to obesity and hyperactivity–to minors. 
 ""There is substantial evidence supporting the claim that, for decades, Hostess has carried out an aggressive marketing campaign with the goal of promoting Twinkie use among underage consumers,"" the FTC report read. ""Our nation's children have been targeted for the consumption of these fattening, unwholesome cakes at a vulnerable age, before they are old enough to make responsible decisions about health and nutrition."" 
 The report also stated that ""as a result of Hostess' targeting of minors, millions of young bodies have been exposed to potentially harmful substances such as fat, sugar, cholesterol, polysorbate 60, calcium sulfate, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and caramel color."" 
 Among the questionable Hostess marketing tactics the FTC report cites: positioning Twinkies billboards in the direct view of schoolyards, airing Twinkies ads on Saturday-morning TV and, most notably, developing and aggressively promoting ""Twinkie The Kid,"" a smiling, lariat-wielding cowboy cartoon mascot shaped like a Hostess Twinkie. 
 ""With Twinkie The Kid, Hostess has deliberately set out to glamorize the Twinkie-eating lifestyle among our nation's young people,"" the report read. ""Since Hostess' introduction of this Twinkie-advocating cartoon spokescake in 1975, use of the product among 12- to 18-year-olds has risen an alarming 240 percent."" 
 ""Eating Twinkies is cool,"" said Emporia, KS, 16-year-old Jason Warriner, who has been a Twinkie user since age 11. ""I didn't like them at first, but all my friends were eating them, so I started doing it too because I wanted to fit in. Now, I love them–I'm practically addicted.""
 ""Twinkies are the best,"" said Utica, NY, 14-year-old Chris Petoskey. ""My mom won't let me have them, but I sneak out and eat them behind the 7-11 whenever I get the chance."" 
 Alarmed by the product's rise in popularity among minors, U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) recently drafted legislation aimed at curbing underage Twinkie use. The bill, which allocates $255 million for PSAs and after-school specials like ABC's recent  , would also prohibit the snack cake from being advertised in youth-oriented publications like   and  comics. Additionally, it would also ban the airing of TV ads featuring Twinkie The Kid before 10 p.m. Similar Hostess characters, including Captain Cupcake, Chauncey Chocodile, King Don and Fruit Pie The Magician, were voluntarily pulled from the air in the late '70s amid similar controversy. 
 Hostess received more bad news Tuesday, when 17 states joined together to file a $206 billion class-action suit to settle claims over the costs associated with treating overweight Twinkie eaters. The suit is based on a precedent-setting 1996 case in which a North Carolina jury held Tastykake responsible for a 460-pound Creme Krimpies addict's death. Tastykake was ordered to pay the victim's family $950,000, the largest-ever award of punitive damages in a snack-food-related casualty. 
 Despite numerous American Medical Association studies linking Twinkies to obesity, hyperactivity and tooth decay, Hostess officials vehemently denied that sustained use of their product causes any adverse health effects. 
 ""Contrary to AMA claims, there is no conclusive evidence demonstrating that regular consumption of Twinkies poses any significant health risk to the eater,"" Hostess chief corporate counsel Richard Weingarten said.

"NEW YORK—Claiming it would be totally fine by them, the nation’s girlfriends assured reporters Tuesday that if a new BBC miniseries remake of   starring Jon Hamm and Emily Blunt somehow got thrown their way, there would be no complaints from them. “All we’re saying is, if they decided to film a classic tale of tangled romance set in Regency England starring those two actors, by all means,” said Denver-area girlfriend Eva Mazula, who added that tossing in a little Ryan Gosling as Mr. Elton wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, either. “And certainly don’t hold back, on our account, on squeezing in a scene where two characters in gorgeous period costumes exchange furtive glances across a ballroom while Judi Dench talks about her daughter’s dowry.

"PHILADELPHIA—As the fifth plate of his 10-course, $150 prix fixe tasting menu dinner was carefully placed on the manicured table in front of him, Kohl-Strauss Media Group CEO Tom Byatt reportedly told a colleague Tuesday that in order for the company to stay afloat in this adverse economic climate, staff layoffs would likely be necessary. ""The fact of the matter is, our financial outlook is just not what it used to be, and if we want to keep the lights on, we're going to have to start making some tough choices,"" said Byatt, cutting into a piece of seared foie gras subsumed in a rich pheasant consommé. ""Personally, I wish we could keep everybody. But unfortunately, I'm in the position of having to decide what the best direction for our company is, and I don't see any other option than reducing our overall cost structure and finding some way to trim payroll."" ""It's far from an ideal situation, but we have to cut corners somewhere,"" Byatt added as a second waiter arrived with a $110 bottle of Château Figeac from the wine cellar. ""That's just a reality of our business model."" Following a 20-minute period in which the executive and his colleague sampled a lobster broth hors d'oeuvre arriving compliments of the chef and listened to the maître d' explain how the lobster had been flown in from Maine that morning, Byatt reasoned that, although it pained him to say so, his company could definitely stand to lose about a dozen people in sales, and roughly another 15 or 20 in the marketing and production divisions. As the pair continued through lavishly designed plates of haute cuisine at a table situated near the window so that Byatt could keep an eye on his valet-parked 2011 Jaguar XJ, they discussed the unfortunate challenges of today's market and the tremendous stress placed on those at the management level to keep their businesses financially solvent. ""As you know, nothing about these layoffs is easy for me,"" said Byatt, lifting his arms so that a waiter could gently sweep tiny morsels of gourmet artisanal bread off the table with a stainless-steel crumb comb. ""I'm going to have to go into the office Monday morning and tell Mark to tell these people that they're going to be let go, all while trying to maintain employee morale. You can imagine how heavily that weighs on me."" ""But I think our remaining staff will certainly recognize everything I'm doing to keep us competitive,"" Byatt continued before deeply inhaling the aroma of a dry-aged bison filet mignon lightly coated in a truffle glaze and resting on a bed of imported fiddlehead ferns. ""I just hope they appreciate the kind of pressure I'm under."" After consuming his dessert courses of lavender crème brûlée and a caramelized brioche with a strawberry foam, restating his belief that payroll cuts are simply part of what a modern company has to do, and offering to have further talks on the subject of reducing company expenditures this weekend at his country house, Byatt thanked his colleague for working with him to ""do right by this company"" and snapped his fingers for the bill. ""Oh, no, no, no, please,"" said Byatt, waving away his colleague's hand and putting down the company credit card. ""I got this.""

""If we have to get an athlete, I'm thinking maybe a power forward. We don't have one of those right now.""

"WASHINGTON—U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed unqualified disgust Tuesday after ruling that fornication with the American flag is an act of free speech protected by the First Amendment. Writing that the 8-1 decision was ""necessary, but it's really just unbelievable that it's come to this,"" Chief Justice John Roberts concluded in his majority opinion that the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression necessarily extends to individuals ""committing unspeakable and abominable acts"" with the flag. ""It is incumbent upon this court to protect all forms of speech, regardless of their popularity, and regardless of whether they involve some sick, twisted human being defiling the enduring symbol of our great nation,"" Roberts wrote. ""I honestly cannot believe I have been put in a position where I have to say something like this, but yes, if you actually want to wrap the American flag around your erect penis and rub vigorously in an effort to bring yourself to orgasm, the First Amendment gives you that right."" ""Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you people?"" Roberts added. Tuesday's case,   began when Rockland, MD resident Trevor Erickson, 31, filed suit following his arrest last November for having sex with an American flag in his backyard. Roberts wrote that while the majority ""agreed wholeheartedly with the spirit"" of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling against Erickson, it was nonetheless compelled to overturn the decision so as to avoid creating a dangerous precedent. ""Unfortunately, we are charged with upholding the First Amendment even when it means defending the most godawful, depraved thing you ever heard of someone doing in your entire life,"" said Roberts, addressing the court. ""As much as we would love to say, 'No, you human pile of excrement, you absolutely cannot fuck the American flag,' it simply would not be consistent with the basic tenets upon which this nation was founded."" Oral arguments for the case were reportedly interrupted several times as justices hurled scathing insults at the plaintiff and, in one incident, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attempted to jump the bench and physically assault Erickson. According to sources, Roberts took the opportunity to make the language of the ruling very specific, largely because the justices agreed in a closed-door session that they never again in their lifetimes wanted to preside over a similar case. ""And just to get this out of the way, once and for all: You can cram the American flag into your vagina or your ass or both at the same time, you can use it to strangle yourself while you masturbate, and you can shit and throw up all over the flag and then have sex with the shit-and-vomit-covered flag while flipping off a bald eagle,"" Roberts said. ""I dearly hope I haven't left anything out, but in case I have, just assume the Constitution permits whatever foul act of flag desecration you sick fucks can conjure up."" ""Also, in the state of Nevada, you can hire two menstruating prostitutes to perform oral sex with each other on top of the American flag while you watch and inject a huge volume of saline solution into your scrotum,"" Roberts continued. ""That is absolutely all I am going to say about this. Thank you."" The single dissenting vote came from Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in his two-sentence dissenting opinion—the shortest in the history of the court—said ""I can't do this anymore. It's destroying me."" Some Americans, however, expressed joy upon hearing news of the ruling. ""What a great day for our country,"" Portland, OR resident David Reston said as he gingerly fed an American flag into his anus while spitting on a small bronze representation of the Statue of Liberty. ""This is exactly what the framers of the Constitution intended."" ",1,Disgusted Supreme Court Can't Believe It Has To Rule Having Sex With American Flag Protected Under First Amendment

"SEATTLE—Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said in a press conference Friday that the Seahawks would be one of the biggest surprises of the 2011 season, as the team is entirely made up of bad secret weapons. “Tarvaris Jackson is going to surprise everyone with his play in our losses this season, tight end Jamison Konz is a threat to make crucial mistakes from anywhere on the field, and no one’s even going to see Charlie Whitehurst coming—he’s that bad,” said Carroll, adding that the team may soon unleash fullback Eddie Williams, a little-known third year player with no actual playing experience who will undoubtedly perform terribly in key short-yardage situations. “Defenses will just have too much to account for—they won’t know where their next easy sack, high wobbling interception, or unforced fumble is coming from.” Carroll said he was excited to see all the terrible players get their chances to screw up, but revealed his idiotic, poorly-thought-out game plan is the team’s best-kept bad secret weapon.

"Even the most spry and agile among us get a little banged up now and then. We fall off bikes, trip on stairs, get our hands caught in doors. A minor injury of this kind is so common that we usually just want to ""shake it off"" and go about our day. But the truth is, even the smallest cut or scrape can become a big problem if not treated properly. Fortunately, tending to one is as simple as three words: Pick at it. Pick at it like crazy. While no two wounds are exactly alike, all can be treated by digging into the damaged tissue in some fashion. How you pick at it isn't really important; the key is to be vigilant and pick at it constantly. It's essential to begin picking as soon as possible, preferably in the very first moments after the injury is sustained. It may be damp with blood at this stage, which is totally normal; simply prod it with your finger several times, just firmly enough to feel how sticky it is. If it seems a bit dry, squeeze it from the edges until fluid seeps to the surface. Keep squeezing it regularly—you want that little wound to always be glazed in pus. The injury will require continual monitoring. You can pick at it in 60-second intervals, scraping out particles of coagulated blood the moment they develop, or you can wait a bit longer for a sturdier scab to form and pull it off as a larger flake. Either approach is fine. What's important is that the affected area preoccupy you for as long as possible, be it days or, ideally, weeks. If you use a Band-Aid, always, always, always peel it back every few minutes to check on your wound. (Before doing that, however, you might also try scratching   the bandage, which has the advantage of allowing you to apply more pressure than you could on exposed skin.) Each time, be sure to smell either the stained gauze pad or the lesion itself, both of which should have the faint odor of cheese due to accumulated sweat and bacteria. If it doesn't smell like cheese, don't worry: You just need to pick at it some more. You should also experiment with laying the adhesive portion of the Band-Aid over the broken skin and pulling it off in order to experience the slightly painful, yet slightly pleasurable, tug of the gluey latex. Our fingernails are the perfect instruments for picking, of course, but they're by no means the only ones at our disposal. Depending on the location of your wound, you can nibble it with your teeth or—for the men—rub it against the grain of your facial hair. Artificial implements also make great picking tools. If you're at work, you can grind your wound into the edge of your desk, probe it with the tip of a pen, or dig into it with the point of a slightly straightened paper clip. At home, a stream of hot water from a high- pressure shower nozzle will do the trick, as will the prongs of a corn holder. And with a car key, you've got something you can saw away with anytime you like. Sadly, most of us have forgotten how to listen to our bodies, and we stop ourselves before doing what millions of years of evolution have taught us to do. But we should embrace our instincts. Next time you get a scrape or cut, do what comes naturally: scratch it, lick it, squish it, or flick it. Remember, the two best doctors in the world are right there at the end of your hand: your thumb and your index finger. So get in there and pick it! And that goes for mosquito bites, too.

"Following this week's freak release of 34 Heigl films, Sony executives were quick to remind the public that the widespread hospitalizations were a result of the sheer amount of Heigl to which the public was exposed. Had the movies been released one at a time, they say, the ill effects would’ve been no greater than the light nausea and confusion which sometimes accompanies with viewing a Heigl vehicle. Take for example, the Christmas-themed ""Holidaze,"" in which Heigl plays a career-driven news producer who's forced off her story about the war in Afghanistan to do a fluff piece about a local toymaker. Had this movie come out in December, when it was supposed to, it would've likely been called it a ""sweet holiday treat"" or a ""forgettable but fun festive film."" It's only because the film—in which a toymaker not only teaches Heigl how to loosen up and fall in love but also the meaning of Christmas—was released alongside 33 other Heigl films that it contributed to the mass psychosis and self-blindings.

""Their continued participation in our forests, meadows, and prairies is an integral part of our natural world, and I think our generous offer reflects that fact."" Under the terms of the agreement, which was conducted through third-party labor mediators, the ground squirrels will be responsible for scurrying up and down trees; rustling in undergrowth; chittering; and eating a variety of seeds, berries, and nuts. The contract stipulates the nation's spotted ground squirrels be paid $345 million over five years and also provides for performance-based bonuses. ""This amount is well in line with the compensation of other North American wildlife, and when you factor in the spotted ground squirrels' vast range of distribution across the country, it's actually quite a value,"" said Ray Chen, who represented the squirrels during arbitration.

Negotiations between Chen's firm of Hannigan, Chen & Falbaum and the Interior Department took nearly two years, and at one point reportedly grew so strained that the government considered opening the bidding to blue jays, marmots, and Lockheed Martin. A deal was reached only after the ground squirrels acquiesced to signing a non- compete clause that forbids the animals from pursuing foraging opportunities in the Asian or Latin American markets. ""We think this was a deal that had to happen, and both sides are satisfied,"" said assistant secretary for wildlife Tom Strickland, who originally balked at the ground squirrel's terms and was chastised by the pro-squirrel-labor lobby for his use of the ""disparaging and insensitive"" slang term ""gopher"" during a television interview early in the negotiations. ""I admit the road here was rocky, and we wish they had given a little on the three-month's hibernation. But no one wanted a return to the strike years of the 1970s, when unburied nuts were piling up on curbs by the thousands."" Because government representatives were unable to move the ground squirrels on several key points, including nesting in attics and garages, and appearing suddenly in the middle of the road for no apparent reason, the contract is essentially the same as the previous agreement, which held from 1998 to 2009. The Interior Department denied that national-park fees would increase to cover the ground squirrels' new contract and insisted that the cost of the most hotly contested portion of the agreement, a provision for comprehensive heath care extending well into retired squirrels' fourth year of life, was included in the total divulged cost. ""Worse comes to worst, we're not locked in to anything, since it's just a five-year deal,"" Salazar said. ""And now that this is behind us, we can turn our attention to making sure we get that contact signed with the bald eagles, who have been threatening to move their operations to Mexico since June.""

"CHICAGO—In an announcement that has electrified the music world, the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew confirmed Monday that it is reuniting and will soon begin work on its first new material since the seminal 1985 ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" single.
 Confirming the recent swirl of music-industry rumors regarding a possible reunion, Shufflin' Crew lead singer Willie Gault told reporters: ""After nearly 12 years of solo gigs and side projects, we decided it was time for us to work together again.""
 Gault went on to strongly deny rumors that the Crew was returning to the studio looking for trouble.
 ""We didn't come here looking for trouble,"" Gault said. ""We just came to record the long-awaited follow-up to the 'Super Bowl Shuffle.'""
 According to Shufflin' Crew member William ""Refrigerator"" Perry, he, Gault and punky QB Jim McMahon have already sketched out rough demo versions of 10 to 15 songs, which will, over the next two months, be fleshed out in the studio with producer Steve Albini.
 Perry said fans should expect the new album to be ""darker and more introspective"" than the group's ""Shuffle""-era work.
 ""[The new album] will definitely reflect our maturation as a group and as individuals,"" said Perry, who may be large but is no dumb cookie. ""Back then, we were young, wild and arrogant: Jim [McMahon] had his spiked hair, shades and controversial, message-bearing headbands, and I had my legendary eating exploits and rushing touchdowns. We kind of had this attitude like, 'We're so bad, we know we're good, blowing your mind like we knew we would.' But while the new record will still have that trademark Shufflin' Crew swagger, it will also show our more reflective side.""
 All of the original Shufflin' Crew members are expected to participate in the reunion except Otis Wilson, who told  magazine in a recent interview that his ""heart just isn't in it anymore.""
 ""Back when the group first started, we were just struttin' for fun,"" Wilson said. ""But once we hit it big, everything changed. Suddenly, there were business meetings, publicity appearances, video shoots, sponsorship deals. Before long, it wasn't about the music anymore. That's when I knew I had to get out.""
 Numerous names have circulated as possible Wilson replacements, ranging from former Poco bassist Jim Messina to former Bengals running back Ickey Woods.
 ""Otis has made his decision, and we respect that. It will be difficult, but we must go on as a band without him,"" Shufflin' Crew co-founder Walter Payton said.
 Added Payton: ""Running the ball is like making romance.""
 While the album is still months from completion, the Shufflin' Crew tried out some of the new material at an unannounced gig at Chicago's Lounge Ax music club last Friday. Response from the sold-out crowd was overwhelmingly positive.
 ""They sounded really good, really tight, man,"" said die-hard fan Jeff Rampling of Des Plaines, IL, who estimated he has been to over 250 Shufflin' Crew shows. ""Once they got warmed up, they were rocking like vintage '85 Crew.""
 ""They kicked some serious ass tonight,"" said Don Frischman, lead singer for Four-Six Defense, a Chicago-area Shufflin' Crew tribute band. ""Richard Dent still blows me away live.""
 In negotiating terms for the new album with Geffen Records, the Shufflin' Crew made one demand: complete creative control over the project.
 ""We made it clear that under no circumstances would we allow participation by the female referee who twice blew a whistle over our singers' attempts to say the word 'ass' during the 'Shuffle' sessions,"" backup vocalist Steve Fuller said. ""The Bears traffic in the truth, and either you can handle it or you can't. Censorship is slavery.""
 Expected to hit stores in early November, the new album will be followed by a world tour beginning February 1999. All proceeds from both the album and tour will go toward charity.
 ""I want to stress that we are not doing this because we're greedy,"" Payton said. ""The Bears are doing this to feed the needy.""
 One of the most successful American bands of the mid-'80s, the Shufflin' Crew broke up in May 1986 due to creative differences and infighting, particularly between Gault and keyboardist Gary Fencik. Gault embarked on a solo career in 1987 and scored a minor hit with the song 'Chocolate Swirl (That's What I'm As Smooth As),' but never equaled the success he had with the Shufflin' Crew. Fencik and Fuller went on to form the band Touchback with New York Giants wide receiver Phil McConkey.
 ""After so many years apart, it feels good to be back together again,"" Gault said. ""But most of all, I'm happy for all the Bears Shufflin' Crew fans out there. You guys are the reason we're shufflin' on down. We're doin' it for you."" ",1,'85 Chicago Bears Return To Studio:
"CHICAGO—Claiming they don’t want to rush the veteran play caller, Bears coach Marc Trestman announced Thursday that the team is giving quarterback Jay Cutler three to four years to properly heal from a lingering ankle injury. “For the sake of the Chicago Bears, we feel it’s best for Jay to take as many years as he needs to fully recover,” said Trestman, who reportedly advised Cutler not to worry about returning in time for the playoffs or the 2014 NFL season. “Looking at the big picture and long-term goals of this football franchise, it would be reckless and irresponsible to allow Jay to get back on the field too soon. Unfortunately, high ankle sprains can be tricky and sometimes need one or two hundred weeks to fully mend.” Bears general manager Phil Emery emphasized that Cutler should focus solely on rehabbing the ankle and that signing a contract extension with the team should be the last thing on anyone’s mind.

"LOS ANGELES—After being a subject of Generation X desire for the better part of two decades, actress Winona Ryder announced Tuesday that she had finally conceded to having intercourse with every interested member within that age group. ""Fine,"" Ryder said in a statement addressed to the 71 million American men and women born between the years 1962 and 1981. ""For more than 20 years, I've had to endure the yearnings of an entire generation of people, so I suppose I owe it to them to finally offer some relief. After all, they've avidly followed my career all this time. I figure it's the least I can do to repay them."" ""Soup's on, boys,"" she added. ""Get it while it's hot."" Ryder, the offbeat 39-year-old star of such films as   and , first stirred sexual longing in Generation X with her 1988 appearance as the alienated and slightly goth teen Lydia in  . Her portrayal of brainy outsiders in the cult films   and   cemented her place in the pantheon of the generation's sexually desirable quirky women. The actress told reporters that the order in which she would sleep with participating members of Generation X would be determined by lottery, and that her offer could be redeemed anywhere participants chose, including their old bedroom from when they were in high school or the backseat of their parents' late-1980s station wagon. ""I will cut my hair to its 1993 length, and we can talk about anything you want before we do it,"" Ryder said. ""Fears for the future, your frustration at having to be part of the corporate machine, anything. We can even listen to period-appropriate music of your choice. Except for Soul Asylum. That is off the table."" Children of the so-called Baby Boomers, Generation X has been characterized as a group unable to speak about anything unironically, while also possessing a mistrust of authority and a longing to have sex with Winona Ryder. According to Ryder, this demographic deserves to have ""at least one"" of its thwarted hopes and dreams for itself actually come true. Those born after 1981 are excluded from Ryder's offer unless they can prove that they, too, experienced the profound ennui associated with walking home alone from the movie theater after seeing   and knowing they would probably never have her. ""I am not taking this lightly,"" said Ryder, who has only done one nude scene in her entire career. ""This came about after years of careful consideration and hearing from every single person within 10 years of my age that they had a crush on me. If I'm going to do it, it's going to be with the same passion I bring to my acting. Added Ryder, ""To be honest, I've always had sort of a crush on Generation X myself."" The response to Ryder's announcement in the Gen-X community has so far been swift and enthusiastic, with many in the usually sullen age group reacting with great surprise and anticipation. ""Wow,"" freelance writer T. Eric Mayhew said as he hurriedly ran his fingers through his unruly hair after being informed that he had drawn lottery number 9,310. ""I'd better shave."" To date, nearly 40 percent of the people identified as members of Generation X have registered to have sex with Ryder, many under pseudonyms in order to protect the families they established when they gave up all hope of ever sleeping with the actress. ""I kind of lost interest when she did that movie where she was dating Richard Gere,"" said Generation X member Don Bloomfield, 41, who is number 789,834 on the list. ""I didn't even realize I still had a thing for her until I saw   on cable last year."" ""I just hope that, before she has to sleep with the next guy, we have time to hold each other and she can tell me that I can make a difference in this world,"" Bloomfield added. As prospective lovers sign up in droves, a few American males aged 30 to 49 have opted to decline Ryder's offer. ""It's tempting, but I've been down that road before,"" Generation X member Johnny Depp, 47, said. ""Besides, I weirdly always had more of a thing for Janeane Garofalo.""

"CHICAGO—As Brian Urlacher triumphantly hoisted the George Halas Trophy Sunday, it was a symbol of more than just the Bears' 39-14 victory over New Orleans—it was a symbol of hope to the thousands of Chicagoans who are still struggling to resume normal lives after the fire that swept through a 2,000-acre swath of downtown, killed over 300 people, injured hundreds more, destroyed a third of Chicago's buildings, and left 100,000 residents homeless this past Oct. 8 through Oct. 10, 1871. ""No disrespect to the Saints,"" Urlacher said, ""but as much as this victory would have meant for any team, after what our city has been through, it means much more to us. Hopefully, going to the Super Bowl will help the people of Chicago put the terrible events of 135 years ago behind them."" Coach Lovie Smith knows that just going to the Super Bowl, or even winning it, will do little to help the city rebuild, but says he is ""humbled"" by the inspiration Chicago residents feel when his team wins.

""At this point, there's little we can do for the victims. But as long as we can inspire the community to hold on and get past what the Great Fire has done to them, we'll have done our job."" ""Everywhere I go, people are like, 'Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you for giving us hope.' And some of them are people whose families lost everything—homes, livestock, wagons, everything,"" said quarterback Rex Grossman, who has donated every game check of the postseason to the Chicago Fire Historical Society. ""And I tell them, 'No, thank you. After what you've been through over the past century or so, you give us a lot of hope.'"" Chicago had an uphill battle for recovery from the devastating blaze, a struggle made more difficult by drought, economic collapse, civil unrest between the city's Protestants, Catholics, and many recently freed slaves, and the apparent indifference to the city's plight by uncharismatic and unpopular Republican president Ulysses S. Grant. Still, the townspeople's imagination was captured by the successful rebuilding of the Chicago Bears, a task once seen as impossible. ""In the days after the fire, there basically were no Chicago Bears,"" said Mayor Richard Daley. ""It took men of vision to found the team in nearby Decatur in 1919, move them to Chicago in 1921, and hire George Halas to coach them. The Bears made a huge effort to attract such great players such as Red Grange, Sid Luckman, Dick Butkus, Walter Payton, and Brian Urlacher. Basically, since the fire, they've turned the team from a total nonentity to a championship contender."" ""The people of Chicago see that and think, 'Hey, if the Bears can do that, we can make this city great again,'"" he added. Schaumburg resident Tom Berry, a clothing salesman who bought Bears tickets as soon after the fire as he could afford them, knows what the team means to the area. ""People lost great-great-grandfathers in the fire. Great-great-great grandfathers lost children in that fire. I think unless you were there, you wouldn't understand,"" Berry said. ""You walk around downtown, look around at the historical sites of all that devastation, and it kind of brings you down.""  ""Except on Sundays,"" Berry added.

"NEW YORK—Cheers filled the streets and American flags waved triumphantly through the air today as the nation turned out in full force to celebrate an entire week having passed since the last time a madman opened fire on innocent civilians in some kind of fatal mass shooting. “We did it, folks! We banded together and managed to go seven whole days without killing our fellow Americans in a senseless murdering spree!” Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said in a speech to jubilant throngs gathered in Times Square. “Yes, some people were shot this week, but not in a random, highly public, viscerally disturbing way and—most importantly—not all in one place, by one psychopath. Maybe one day we can live in a society where abominable large-scale gun violence stays out of the national headlines for a whole month even!” At press time, federal authorities had issued a reminder to all Americans that a lot can happen in 24 hours, “so let’s not get too excited yet.” UPDATE: Federal officials have reportedly just informed celebrating Americans that a mass shooting did in fact just happen in front of the Empire State Building, and that citizens should stop chanting and cheering now. “Oh,” Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said, looking at what appeared to be a news alert on her cell phone. “You know what, forget it. There was another one about 20 blocks from here. So, party’s over. Sorry.” Napolitano then urged the visibly saddened Americans to be careful, get back home as soon as possible, lock all their doors, and never leave their homes unless it is absolutely essential.

"BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, NC—The tree best known for portraying an eastern hemlock in the 1978 film   passed away Monday morning on the steep, north-facing slope it called home.  The tree was 286.  After shooting to stardom in the late 1970s with its scene-stealing turn as a stately old-growth conifer in  , the tree soon cemented its reputation as one of Hollywood's most dependable character actors.  According to its publicist, the woody plant and beloved fixture of nearly 40 feature films died of complications relating to adelgid beetles and lightning.  ""It will be missed,""   costar Robert De Niro said. ""We took a shine to each other immediately. That tree taught me a lot about acting and about life.""  The veteran entertainer worked continuously throughout its 43-year career, winning respect in the movie industry for its stoic, graceful presence, its unassuming branches, and its deep commitment to the craft of acting. Much of the tree's success stemmed from its remarkable range across genres and its ability to convincingly portray a wide variety of deciduous and broadleaf North American species. ""[The tree] was a consummate professional that truly lived for its work,"" said filmmaker and friend Michael Mann, who cast the 98-foot-tall plant in its acclaimed role as an Adirondack black spruce in the background of 1992's  . ""On   we would sometimes do 30 or 40 takes, and each time it gave us something totally different and interesting. This is a sad day for cinema."" Planted in 1722, the tree got its first taste of show business after a chance meeting with high-powered agent Sue Mengers during her camping trip in the summer of 1972. According to Hollywood insiders, Mengers was instrumental in helping the tree land its breakout role as a piece of riverside foliage in John Boorman's classic  . ""Even then, you could see this special sort of magnetism that it had,"" said   costar Jon Voight, who later reteamed with the   for a 48-frame tracking shot in the 1985 thriller  . ""I remember it seeming very nervous its first day on set. But after a few takes, it was just a total natural and a pleasure to work with.""  A number of film and television projects followed, including a memorable guest appearance as a treacherous-mountain-pass fir in a 1974 episode of  . But its most famous role was undoubtedly its portrayal of a melancholy but proud Western Pennsylvania hemlock in Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning epic  . ""I actually didn't want to cast it at first, because the role was originally written for a hardwood sapling,"" said Cimino, who featured the tree prominently in two long exterior shots in the film's famous ""last hunt"" sequence. ""But its screen test was just so fearless and so moving. It had that rare quality in a coniferous performer where you just believed everything it did.""  Failing to capitalize on the success of  , the tree endured some lean years in the 1980s, including a much-derided appearance in a 1987 Honeycomb Hideout commercial and a series of public service announcements for the Smokey the Bear campaign. It also attracted unwanted attention in 1989 following rumors of a love affair with actress Margot Kidder.  But the 1990s saw a series of high-profile comeback roles, and the tree won widespread critical praise in 1993 when it was leaned against by Harrison Ford during a wilderness escape scene in  .  More recently it was cast as one of the trees glimpsed through the living room window in  , and in the HBO miniseries  , for which it was briefly considered for the title role until disagreements emerged over the project's creative direction. Attorneys announced Monday that, in accordance with its will, the tree will be carved into canoes for underprivileged youths. ",1,Tree Featured In 'The Deer Hunter' Dies

"MIAMI—After straining his abdominal muscles, Miami power forward Chris Bosh will be out indefinitely in what appears to be a severe case of poetic justice for his arrogant and presumptive team, sources close to the Heat confirmed Tuesday. An MRI performed late Monday confirmed the analysis: Bosh going down late in the first half of Miami's 95-86 victory over the Pacers Sunday was exactly what the team had coming for assuming the NBA title was theirs by right. ""After examining Bosh's test results, I have to say that this comeuppance for unbounded hubris will certainly keep Bosh out for the rest of the playoff series against Indiana, if not longer,"" Heat physician Dr. Harlan Selesnick said. ""Unfortunately, no matter how fitting it may be, this is exactly the kind of cosmic, karmic punishment the team can't afford at this time."" Analysts agreed that Tuesday's 78-75 loss to the humbler, more team-oriented Pacers, who at no point attempted to create a top-heavy roster centered around three superstars, can be directly traced to Bosh's fate-induced absence. ""LeBron James and Dwyane Wade put up amazing numbers in that game, scoring 21 of the Heat's 24 points in the fourth quarter,"" Associated Press sportswriter Jeff Latzke said. ""Of course, that simply showcases their selfishness and serves to demonstrate how the hand of universal justice was already smiting them for their unearned pride."" ""The sight of Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem and Joel Anthony struggling to make up for Bosh's presence reminds us that a team without depth can never truly prevail,"" ESPN's J.A. Adande said. ""Unfortunately, when a franchise tries to buy a championship artificially instead of building a team naturally over years of hard work and development, it becomes more vulnerable to the machinations of fate as the universe attempts to restore its balance. Frankly, the Heat should have expected this kind of heavenly retribution."" For his part, Bosh has said that he would be back ""once our season is extended"" and that he hoped his injury ""doesn't mean we have to wait another year for a championship,"" casting doubt on whether he has actually begun to recover from his case of poetic justice. ""It's exactly this kind of presumption, this sense of entitlement, the idea that the Heat are somehow destined to win simply because they are the Heat, that knocked Bosh out in the first place,"" Adande said. ""At this rate it seems he's just trying to get D-Wade's leg broken or have LeBron struck by lightning."" Claiming that Bosh's aggressive playing style simply makes him more prone to stress injuries such as muscle strains, Miami coach Erik Spoelstra was markedly reluctant to address questions as to whether the Heat's generally unlikable attitude, infuriating sense of entitlement, or general lack of character played any part in fortune taking a much-deserved toll. ""As usual, I think the rest of the NBA is reacting with jealousy and bitterness by enjoying that one of our superstars is hurt. Well, we have two other superstars, and many of these lesser teams have none,"" Spoelstra said Tuesday night in a brazen display of exactly the sort of cocksure attitude the Heat are currently being punished for.

"FORMER DAVENPORT, IA—Immediately following the performance of a same-sex marriage ceremony Sunday afternoon at Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church on Lincoln Avenue, the city of Davenport, IA and all 99,685 of its residents were reportedly smitten into oblivion by the merciless wrath of God and flung into the deepest bowels of eternal hell. According to state authorities, the nightmarish incident occurred approximately five seconds after a local pastor pronounced homosexual men Brian Palmer, 39, and Greg DeHaan, 43, married in the eyes of God, at which point a tremor registering 8.5 on the Richter scale ripped the earth asunder and Davenport's inhabitants were swallowed by a widening chasm, where they found themselves eviscerated on the fiery spears of 10 million shrieking demons. ""They tried to warn us and we didn't listen—Lord, why did we not listen?"" said Rev. Kenneth Hanson, the clergyman who performed the unholy marriage, moments before being dragged into a bottomless pit, flayed alive, and devoured by Satan, the Great Deceiver. ""All I wanted to do was provide basic civil rights and legal recognition to Brian and Greg, two people who love each other and have been together for 15 years. But I was wrong. Oh, so wrong!"" ""Children of God throughout the nation!"" Hanson cried out as he plummeted into the infernal void. ""Do not make the same mistake we here in Iowa have made! Save yourselves before it is too late!"" Witnesses reporting from the scene immediately preceding the destruction of Davenport recounted a number of horrific sights, including demonic wraiths clothed in smoke and ash flying through the city's streets; homosexuals and heterosexuals alike being torn limb from limb by goat-legged imps, the skeletons of live dogs leaping from the creatures' bodies to feast upon small children; and a great wall of fire that spread from the altar where the small, private wedding ceremony was conducted in west Davenport and consumed all. In the wake of the disaster, many friends, relatives, and fellow Iowans said they blamed Brian and Greg most of all, for having given in to Satan's obvious machinations despite the numerous warnings presented to them. ""Why did Brian and Greg insist upon this public, legally binding avowal of their love?"" sobbed a relative who now lives in Minnesota and wished to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisals by the Forces of Righteousness. ""Why couldn't they have just kept living as second-class citizens, without the tax incentives and insurance flexibility offered to married couples?"" As friends and family of the longtime couple endured the agony of hot lances pierced through their eyes and a cloud of sulfurous gas enveloped the city, Iowans expressed great remorse for ignoring God's design and allowing the union of Brian and Greg to occur. ""We should have seen this coming when that Plague of Locusts appeared in central Scott County last month after they applied for the marriage license,"" said a terrified Marsha Ternus, former chief justice of the Iowa State Supreme Court, who was ousted last November for her support of an earlier ruling declaring the state's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. ""It was such a clear omen, yet we were too blind to see. We have brought the Vengeance of the Lord down upon the people of Davenport with our hubristic refusal to obey what is written in holy scripture. May God have mercy on our souls."" The event, which is being called a clear and irrefutable message from God as to his position on gay marriage, came as a shock to many around the nation who believed that allowing gays and lesbians to marry was the right thing to do and therefore could not invoke the displeasure of the Almighty Lord. Meanwhile, as citizens prayed furiously for the Lord's forgiveness, officials said they were working around the clock to drain local rivers and lakes of the blood and entrails of sinners, and will soon plug up the gaping, smoldering hole where Davenport once stood and from whence the stench of roasting flesh and the cackle of Satan himself continues to emanate. Following the immolation of Davenport, LGBT communities across the country immediately issued statements acknowledging their culpability for the catastrophe, admitting that homosexuality was a sinful lifestyle deserving of wrathful punishment. In surveys, 100 percent of homosexuals polled said that, given the clear evidence of God's Will shown by the tragic events, the best course of action would be to abandon the notion of gay rights altogether and beg the Lord's forgiveness. ""I thought antigay activism was cruel and bigoted before, but now I can see that, yes, my sexual orientation is truly an abomination in the Eyes of God,"" said lesbian activist and organizer Professor Julia Cafritz of Houston, responding to early reports of God's actions in the Midwest. ""My very existence is an affront to all that is good and true in this country. I'm sorry, America. I'm so, so terribly sorry."" At press time, officials said the overall strength of the traditional American family had increased by 47 percent following the eternal damnation of Davenport, while pure, hardworking Christians everywhere would continue to be assured a place in heaven.

Sometimes you simply need to find an innovative new approach, as the King did setting his longbowmen on the flanks of the defile to attack Charles d’Albert’s oncoming cavalry.” Duncan added that while the Lakers should take heart from England’s unexpected military triumph, they should also always honor the memory of the estimated 10,000 soldiers from both sides who gave their lives during the 15th-century battle.

"PROVO, UT—In response to Brigham Young basketball player Brandon Davies' suspension from the Cougar squad for having premarital sex with his girlfriend, his fellow students have taken to their school's campus en masse, protesting the player's expulsion by engaging in flagrant public sex. ""While Davies may have violated the honor code, that code has nothing to do with 'honor' at all,"" BYU sophomore Clayton Ross said Wednesday as he vigorously penetrated his girlfriend, sophomore Amanda Hesketh, beneath the bronze statue of school founder and namesake Brigham Young. ""It has more to do with an attitude of moral control on the part of the university that we find—unhh—that we find distrustful and distasteful and, oh my God, oh my God. Amanda!"" ""Wow,"" an exhausted Ross continued. ""Anyway, that's why we're out here doing this."" On the evening of Mar. 1, BYU officials announced that Davies, a promising sophomore center, had been released from the basketball team, a decision that sent the shocked campus into an uproar. Within minutes, the campus was filled with demonstrating, groaning students engaged in sexual intercourse in support of Davies. Over the next week, students began organizing large-scale protest orgies via Twitter and Facebook, with a majority of the university's undergraduates gathering to fuck one another's brains out all day and all night on the campus's main quad, on the steps of the Smoot Administration Building, and throughout the BYU Museum of Art. At one point the entire football field at LaVell Edwards Stadium was covered in naked students close to, or achieving, climax. ""I'm sure Davies' teammates knew all about his relations with his girlfriend,"" said business administration major Katherine Fagin as she rode her boyfriend, Daniel Samson, on the roof of the Spencer W. Kimball Tower. ""Nnnngh. Oh. Oh! Ahhh. But do you think they're going to suspend Jimmer Fredette for not reporting Davies? I doubt it."" BYU officials confirmed that students who are caught having sex on campus will be charged with honor-code violations in accordance with university bylaws, but they acknowledged the sheer number of students copulating in solidarity with Davies had made the situation unwieldy for proctors and resident assistants attempting to control the situation. ""There were an estimated 4,000 students having sex inside the performing arts center,"" Associate Dean of Students Jonathan Kau said. ""So it's virtually impossible to establish any semblance of order. And the students are so absorbed in all the passionate sex they're having that they don't even pay attention when I try to stop them. I did call the police, who at one point tried to hose them down, but the students just seemed to like that more."" ""I am also somewhat concerned about their safety,"" Kau added. ""Especially for the couple I saw engaged with each other against a full-length window in the Lee Library. I'm pretty sure sex standing up against a window is an honor-code violation, anyway."" University officials admitted that the round-the-clock demonstrations, which ""show absolutely no signs of slackening,"" have been peaceful if occasionally vocal. No damage has been done to the school's facilities or buildings, and where gardens or lawns have been disturbed, students have reportedly tried to replace divots and remove any wrappers, used condoms, or other detritus. ""No one has missed class, no one has been hurt, and everything we've done has been out of principle,"" junior class president Lucas Williams said from between the thighs of his girlfriend Marissa Haley on the north campus lawn. ""In fact, by most people's definition, everyone has acted honorably. All we want is for the administration to admit that and engage with us in a frank discussion of the honor code. Until then, we'll be out here every day. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, you bet we will. That's right. Yes."" While Davies remains suspended, he was present on the bench for the Cougars' home win against Wyoming last Saturday night, smiling as his team won a share of the Mountain West Conference championship in front of a jubilantly cheering and fucking crowd. ""It was really special to be there, even if I had to sit on the bench in street clothes between a guy getting blown and a couple of juniors watching the game while doing the reverse cowgirl,"" said Davies, who was also allowed to cut down the net in a magnanimous decision by Coach Dave Rose that is sure to become controversial. ""And when all those fans rushed the court at the buzzer, tore off their clothes, and just started doing it all over the floor…I kind of got misty, I admit it."" ""Now I want to come back worse than ever,"" Davies added. ",1,BYU Students Protest Brandon Davies' Dismissal By Having Sex All Over Campus
"KANSAS CITY—With their offense floundering, their pitching the league's worst, and their footwork on double-play balls atrocious, the Royals (12-37) announced Sunday that former youth-baseball coach and instructional-videotape producer Tom Emanski would join the team in a specially created fundamentals-coaching role, designed to help the Royals get back to basics and start playing winning baseball the Tom Emanski way. Royals owner David Glass reportedly contacted Emanski after watching his team suffer an embarrassing 15-4 loss against the Yankees on Saturday. After viewing tapes of this and past games, and noting that his players were displaying poor mechanics in the second phase of their relay throws, were failing to execute the ""call the cutoff"" play, and were not hitting the baseball, Glass immediately hired Emanski—the man whose patented practice techniques once produced back-to-back-to-back AAU national champions—in what analysts are calling a last-ditch effort to turn the Royals season around. ""From everything I've heard, Mr. Emanski sounds like a wonderful asset for any team—a must-have for players and coaches alike,"" Glass said as he observed his players sitting in a circle and rolling baseballs to one another, an exercise Emanski says ""fosters teamwork and teaches players how to field ground balls""—two of the many basic skills that have been noticeably absent from the Royals 2006 season. ""Tom has a proven track record at molding young, inexperienced athletes into major-league-caliber baseball players,"" Glass added. ""I'm just hoping he can do the same with our Kansas City Royals."" Emanski said he welcomed the challenge of working with the Royals, and vowed that, if the players follow his revolutionary training methods, he will be able to add 6 mph of arm strength to each starting pitcher in five weeks, cut down on the team's mental errors, and ""take the mystery out of hitting."" ""The first thing I did after Sunday's game was gather the players and ask all 25 of them what each one thinks is the most important part of baseball, and an astounding 21 of them said 'hitting home runs,' including seven pitchers,"" said Emanski, who stressed to them that ""defense wins ballgames."" ""The second thing I did was line them up against the fence and hit sharp line drives at them from 20 feet away to improve their reaction time."" ""It's called the Missile Drill,"" Emanski added. ""Builds team character."" Before Monday's game, Emanski taught the Kansas City infielders and outfielders how to properly throw a baseball, outlining the three main steps to making strong, accurate throws—the ""stride and set,"" the ""90-degree hip swivel,"" and the ""full, fluid follow-through."" ""It was a little rough going for some of the guys, but we're taking it slow,"" Emanski said. ""I think now it might be time to let up a little bit and switch gears into 'Encouragement Mode' for a few games to get their confidence back up."" ""Coach Emanski taught me that, when I'm fielding the ground ball, I should stay down, stick my butt out, and count the hops,"" said shortstop Angel Berroa, explaining the method Emanski designed to help Little Leaguers and Royals infielders watch the ball all the way into their glove. ""Once Coach Emanski also taught me how to count, the technique worked out great."" Although most players are reportedly ""learning a lot"" from Emanski, claiming his methods are ""fun, educational, and make good baseball sense,"" some of the Royals veterans are resistant to throwing away everything they know about baseball in order to be taught these new fundamentals. ""I don't see how trying to throw balls into a metal garbage can laid out behind home plate is going to help my defense,"" said Royals right fielder Reggie Sanders, who has yet to record a single outfield assist since July 12, 2005. ""Tom says it will be more rewarding once I start actually getting the throws to go into the cans, but I'm beginning to think that it's impossible."" ""I'm not going to stand around hitting off a kid's tee—I'm a professional baseball player,"" said Royals first-baseman and No. 3 hitter Doug Mientkiewicz, who is batting .258 on the season with one home run and 14 RBI. ""This is an insult."" The afternoon after speaking to reporters, Mientkiewicz lost his temper during B.P. and swung as hard as he could, missing the ball completely but creating enough of a breeze to gently knock the ball off its stand. Emanski had to restrain him from angrily swinging his bat at the tee in an attempt to break it, and told Mientkiewicz to take a lap around the field to calm down. ""In this game, attitude is key,"" Emanski said. ""Some of the guys get angry or upset when we're doing Greenie Board Batting Practice, in which I give each player five swings, and I rate each swing on a zero-to-four scale. But I believe this is the only way they'll ever learn to swing  the ball."" ""Of course, even if you master all the fundamental drills—the Bare Hand Drill, Soft Toss Creep, 'V' Drill, 'X' Drill, and Rocket Relay—there is still the issue of talent,"" Emanski added. ""I'm no miracle worker. But, with a lot of hard work and a little luck, I truly believe that a few of these Royals will someday have the skills you need to play in the major leagues.""

"RICHMOND, VA—As a local FedEx Kinko's became the nerve center of a desperate search for missing 9-year-old Haley Bonhomme, branch manager Thomas Pyle expressed a ""deep personal investment"" in the tragedy. The 35-year-old copy-store veteran remains eager to facilitate the girl's frantic parents' bulk-orders of hundreds of flyers, posters, and notices, he said. ""Along with everyone else, I hope and pray that little Haley eventually turns up safe and sound,"" Pyle said. ""I also want to assure the Bonhomme family that everyone on our friendly, helpful staff will be more than happy to advise them on any additional paper stock, color, and, as time drags on, bulk-purchasing and large-format presentation options. Whatever we can do to help."" Following Haley's disappearance during a family outing at Byrd Park Tuesday, her parents, Robert and Susan Bonhomme, have printed more than 500 flyers, about 220 of which have been distributed. ""Since Haley went missing, the outpouring of concern from family members and the community at large has deeply affected all of us here at FedEx Kinko's,"" Pyle said, adding that the store's copiers have been ""humming like never before"" as the search reaches the 72-hour mark. ""It seems like Bob, Sue, or one of their friends comes in here every few hours like clockwork, cranking out a hundred more crisp, clear, high-quality copies."" Pyle himself has pitched in to aid the search effort by recommending a higher-grade paper stock that could be stapled to telephone poles and better withstand the elements. ""They were going to choose cheap, lightweight paper that would just turn to pulp if there was a sudden rain shower,"" Pyle said. ""I recommended the saffron color, too, so they'd stand out. It means an extra four cents per copy, but money should be the farthest thing from people's minds when a little girl is missing."" Pyle also suggested that the Bonhommes allow the staff to make copies, saying that, while it's a few dollars more, the family ""should really be out there searching."" While Pyle called the family's original hand-printed flyer ""simple and poignant,"" he steered them toward a more professional desktop-publishing approach, introducing a wide array of font and graphic choices. ""This crisis has become the town's, as well as FedEx Kinko's, number-one priority,"" Pyle said. ""That's why the Bonhommes need something that pops and grabs the attention of passersby: bolder, sans-serif fonts, and bigger size. Plus, we usually only laminate business cards, but a little-known fact is that we can laminate anything up to 18 by 24 inches."" Pyle also informed the distraught parents that the store's computer stations could be used for checking e-mail and the Internet for possible leads and tips about their daughter at very competitive rates. ""With our full WiFi capability, FedEx Kinko's is ideal for lost-child-reporting technology access,"" Pyle said. ""And, God forbid it comes to this, our overnight shipping services would at least guarantee the speedy arrival of a ransom payment."" Pyle said the crisis will not only bring FedEx Kinkos and the family closer, but could bring in new customers as well. ""Everyone involved in this search is seeing why we're the clear choice for emergencies great and small,"" said Pyle. ""And with 24-hour service, FedEx Kinko's will always be there for you."" ""As much as we all want to see her found, I have to admit that this synergy is a win-win for both of us,"" he added. ""Our flyers are helping them raise awareness of their daughter's disappearance, while at the same time generating word-of-mouth buzz about our excellent printing and copying options. Having said that, my heart goes out to them at this difficult time."" Pyle added that, even in a worst-case scenario, he hoped the Bonhommes would still turn to FedEx Kinko's. ""They've certainly earned a discount on a beautiful 7' x 2' color banner which can read 'Welcome Home, Haley' just as easily as 'Farewell, Sweet Angel,'"" Pyle said.

"GHOUTA, SYRIA—With its uneven, debris-strewn playing surface causing balls to bounce severely and unpredictably, players at this year’s highly anticipated Syrian Open admitted Thursday that the tournament is a serious test for anyone unaccustomed to its notorious rubble courts. Unlike the perfectly manicured grass, clay, and hard courts at other tennis events, the annual tournament’s heaps of concrete, ash, and mangled steel girders reportedly frustrate first-time competitors and veterans alike, leading to numerous early-round upsets and frequent in-match forfeitures due to lost limbs. “The Syrian is easily one of the most physically and mentally demanding events on the tour,” said women’s 4-seed Maria Sharapova, noting that it requires incredible effort and concentration to block out the pervasive rotting stench at Ghouta’s All-Syria Club. “It can be infuriating having to run across twenty feet of shattered glass and mortar just to track down a routine drop shot, but, of course, your opponent is dealing with the same thing.” “There are a lot of little adjustments you have to make while playing here,” Sharapova continued. “The rubble just tends to favor flatter groundstrokes with less topspin, and all the dried blood out there pretty much renders your slice useless. It’s a very tricky surface.” Describing the jagged detritus around the net as a major obstacle for the serve-and-volley strategy, players told reporters that it often takes several days to become accustomed to the pained wails of distress and intermittent bursts of gunfire issuing from the Syrian Open’s otherwise eerily quiet stands. “You certainly have to get into a rhythm, evading the live grenades and altering your kick serve so it lands in the service box without hitting any used artillery shells,” said men’s world  No. 3 and three-time winner Roger Federer, noting that the tournament is notorious for frequently suspending play due to starved, terrified civilians running across the courts while attempting to flee the country. “The first time I played here, I was so distracted by the explosions and the distraught, crying mothers roaming the grounds, I didn’t even make it out of the second round.” According to those who have competed in previous years, the event gives a distinct advantage to more agile players who can easily dash around charred husks of destroyed vehicles while adjusting their footwork to avoid triggering the many active landmines littering the court. While some thrive in the slower, extremely cautious playing style of the rubble courts, the Syrian Open remains incredibly divisive among players. Many have reportedly complained in recent years about the tournament’s strict policy of wearing all-white Kevlar vests during match-play, and several high-profile stars have also publicly demanded that officials install a retractable roof enclosure to shield against the many ballistic missiles landing in and around the courts. “People always talk about the difficult surface and the sarin gas hanging in the air, but I love it here,” said defending champion Tomas Berdych, who won last year after all four quarterfinalists in the opposite half of the draw withdrew with shrapnel injuries. “The way I see it, you can either get annoyed at the tattered, sagging nets and decomposing human bodies, or you can embrace them.” “Novak [Djokovic] is the real master on rubble,” added Berdych. “He just has a knack for knowing exactly when to take cover from detonating pipe bombs, and it’s amazing to watch him move so quickly across the smoldering ground and then fire a pinpoint forehand to within an inch of the severed body part he’s aiming for. Beating him in the final after he was hit by crossfire between warring rebel groups was one of the highlights of my career.” Though the Syrian Open offers very limited access to food and clean water, and has not featured a functional scoreboard since 2011, players said the event still attracts competitors from across the world seeking to prove themselves and take home the highly coveted silver car bomb. “Once you get past the fact that there’s no security personnel, no clubhouse, and no safe shelter for miles, you settle into a groove,” said women’s top seed Li Na. “You can’t let it get into your head when gangs of armed men keep kidnapping the ball boys or the chair umpire is blown away by a barrel bomb dropped from a helicopter—you just play through that stuff.” “That’s just the unique atmosphere of the Syrian,” Li added. “It’s become part of the tradition here.” As with last year’s event, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is expected to attend the men’s final Sunday and will be seated with his wife in box seats just above the centre court mass graves.

"LOS ANGELES—Reflecting a significant shift in societal attitudes and behaviors, a survey completed this week by researchers at the University of Southern California revealed that American adults are watching far better sex than ever before. The initial findings, which sociologists gathered from thousands of telephone and in-person interviews as well as field observations, confirmed that the sex that U.S. citizens now see on screen is considerably more adventurous, passionate, and satisfying than any they have previously experienced. “Based on our data, the American people are now regularly viewing the highest quality sex of their lives, which is characterized by stronger connections with those on screen and longer, more fulfilling climaxes,” said lead researcher Patricia Oberlin, adding that the vast majority of those surveyed claimed they have watched “mind-blowing” or “earth-shattering” sex within the past five days. “Every demographic that we queried—individuals and couples, young and old, males and females, gay and straight—they’re all engaging in rich and rewarding sex-watching lives, with many respondents reporting that they never imagined they would ever see such thrilling sex.” “We found that Americans now routinely take part in watching wild, energetic sexual intercourse, which often lasts for greater lengths of time,” Oberlin continued. “And the frequency of sex viewing in the U.S. has increased as well, with many people saying they watch sex every day of the week and occasionally two times per night. All in all, Americans’ sex-viewing lives are incredibly active.” Sociologists attributed the improved quality of copulation that Americans are watching to an increased level of attention paid to their particular desires during sex-viewing. This heightened level of comfort and empowerment while watching sex, according to researchers, has allowed the general public to shed their inhibitions and view a wider variety of erotic acts, with many Americans reportedly experimenting with different or unfamiliar positions, toys, age groups, and ethnic and racial backgrounds to keep their viewing lives fresh and interesting. “Earlier in their lives, people might have only been exposed to an old-fashioned sexual viewing experience where the sex was fairly routine and the emphasis was entirely on pleasuring the male, but our data shows that this isn’t always the case anymore,” Oberlin said. “In fact, we found that a large number of Americans even prefer to watch sex that focuses solely on female pleasure and doesn’t involve men at all.” Researchers confirmed that since the last time the survey was conducted, in 1989, there has been a large increase in watching forms of sex that were previously considered taboo, citing examples such as oral sex performed to the point of asphyxiation, fisting, and erotic lactation. While the study determined that vaginal intercourse is still by far the most commonly viewed sexual act in the U.S., more Americans, including a large percentage of women, indicated they are now open to watching fellatio, cunnilingus, anal penetration, and dominance and submission. “I used to only watch the missionary position, which was kind of boring, but now, I’ve been getting into watching sensual massages and role-playing stuff with cheerleader costumes,” said Patrick Sanders, 38, a Phoenix-area husband and father of two. “The truth is I used to have a lot of hang-ups and I couldn’t even fathom watching a threesome with two men and one woman. In fact, the thought of seeing another guy’s penis during sex-viewing was just gross. But it turns out I was missing out on watching some really hot sex.” “At this point, I’m completely fine seeing someone ejaculate on pretty much any body part—in fact, that’s something I discovered I actually enjoy viewing,” added Sanders. “I’m even thinking of exploring watching bondage. That’s something I never could have viewed years ago.” Researchers also found that Americans are spicing up their sex-watching lives by viewing intercourse in different settings such as bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, offices, classrooms, parks, college dorms, public spaces, and even moving vehicles. In addition, many of those surveyed said they are watching sex more spontaneously or viewing it at unusual times of day, which they said increased their arousal. “Sometimes, I’ll watch sex first thing in the morning before I roll out of bed and get ready for work, and it’s fantastic,” said Mitch Watson, adding that he has never felt more alive. “I thought I was watching pretty good sex in my 20s, but this is a whole new level. I know what I want to watch now, and it’s a little more unrestrained and kinky.” “Last week, my wife and I booked a hotel for a couple nights and spent the entire time in the room,” continued Watson. “We just ordered room service and watched great sex all weekend.” ",1,Survey: Americans Watching Better Sex Than Ever
"WASHINGTON—An alarming report released Thursday by researchers at the Economic Policy Institute confirmed that, following a generation of dwindling economic opportunities and stagnant wages, the American middle class is now running dangerously low on things it can be squeezed out of. “Based on our findings, the nation is heading toward a disastrous point in the next decade at which there will no longer be a single facet of our economy from which middle- class families can be further squeezed,” said lead researcher Bryan Shale, adding that having already squeezed middle-income Americans out of job security, access to bank loans, high-quality education, retirement investing, and home ownership, the U.S. had nearly exhausted its already limited supply of squeezable sectors. “Perhaps most distressing is that given how rapidly the middle class has been driven from upward mobility and reliable healthcare, the few areas left to squeeze them out of are negligible at best. We’re scraping the bottom of the barrel here if the ability to shop at premium supermarkets, have museum memberships, or take weekend getaways is all that remains. Unless lawmakers take immediate action, we’re talking about the real possibility of a world in which the middle-class squeeze as we know it is complete, and the majority of Americans can be squeezed no further.” The researchers confirmed, however, that the U.S. middle class is still reliably being hit from all sides.

"CLEVELAND—Noting that it normally takes several seasons before a tandem develops such a solid connection, Cleveland Browns head coach Mike Pettine told reporters Thursday that he has been extremely impressed by rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel’s growing chemistry with the team bench. “They haven’t had much time together yet, but Johnny is really beginning to gel with our bench,” said Pettine, adding that the Browns coaching staff has been incredibly pleased to see the ease and comfort with which their first-year signal caller has worked with the bench during practices and preseason games. “You can tell there’s a genuine sense of trust and a truly unspoken bond between the two. It’s a very natural relationship, and we’re very excited to see how it grows—so far, they’ve been practically inseparable.” Pettine added that given the way Manziel has clicked with the bench thus far, he believes the two have the potential to eventually become the Browns’ most prolific quarterback-bench tandem since the Brady Quinn era.

"PHILADELPHIA—Saying the live performance will be a dream come true following decades of music study, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra announced Wednesday that they simply cannot wait for their upcoming collaboration with John Mellencamp. “I’ve practiced the viola 10 hours a day for the past 25 years, received an education at the New England Conservatory, and partaken in three artist residencies, so the opportunity to serve as accompaniment to members of John Mellencamp’s touring band is truly a great honor,” said associate principal violist Paul Chiu, adding that playing the same simple melody as the rest of the string section and the entire woodwind section during the chorus of “Hurts So Good” would be a “feather in the cap” of his distinguished classical music career. “To repeat the same sequence of eight notes over and over again while staring at the back of John Mellencamp’s head as amplified guitars and boisterous audience members drown out most of the sound—I can’t think of a greater privilege than that. The only thing better would be playing with Jon Bon Jovi, but I’m not getting my hopes up.” At press time, Chiu had sequestered himself in a practice space for the day to rehearse his part for the song “R.O.C.K.

Additionally, the editors said each issue will include old pictures and stories of former passengers’ favorite Delta memories in the regular columns “Flights Of Fancy” and “Touching Down,” and will also feature articles on the kinds of work currently being carried out by the pilots and flight attendants at their alma mater. “I was friendly with everyone in my boarding group, but my seatmate and I are still really close—we see each other all the time,” alumnus John Harley writes in a story titled “Delta Flight #5803: Where Are They Now?” “Obviously, I met passengers from other parts of the cabin while waiting for the bathroom or picking up my luggage, but the people who were seated near me are the ones I spent the most time with. The guys in row 31, seats A through C, were actually in my wedding.” “It’s weird to think that when I first met my good friend Mark he was just on standby,” he continues. “Now he’s a member of the Delta Sky Club—my, how times have changed. But we still all meet back at LaGuardia every five years to catch up.” Harley goes on to write that he and his friends always return to the same Auntie Anne’s location between Gates B5 and B7 where they ate 20 years ago, noting that, “After all these years, that place is still going strong.” According to Delta officials, every issue of   will include a postage-paid mail-in form that alumni can use to make a tax-deductible donation to the airline.

"NATICK, MA—Saying that the ratings were influential in helping them make decisions about where to pursue higher education, prospective college applicants across the country reportedly rushed online this week to consult The Princeton Review’s 2015 “Best College Radio Station” rankings. “This list is a pretty big factor in determining where I want to go—there’s no way I’m sending an application to a school that isn’t in the top 10 campus stations,” said high school senior Kyle Hofstadter, adding that seeing St. Bonaventure University’s 88.3 “The Buzz” jump to number three this year had considerably influenced his decision to apply early. “I’m going to do some research on my own about things like how soon they let you become a DJ and what their indie-to-hip-hop ratio is like, just to make sure I’m not putting too much stock in the rankings. But after reading this, I’m pretty sure I know the schools that are right for me.” Many applicants added that they also intended to consider a safety school such as Denison University, whose 91.1 WDUB “The Doobie” was ranked an unimpressive 17th on the list.

"LINTON, IN—Startled upon realizing he had a genuine interest and viewpoint concerning education reform, local man Greg Woodry told reporters Tuesday that it seemed as if he had begun, ever so slightly, to stand for something. Woodry, a 34-year-old account manager who until now has lived his life with considerable ambivalence toward major social or political issues, said he has been taken aback by the sense of engagement suddenly arising within him. “I’m starting to think I have a real opinion about something,” said Woodry, expressing genuine shock that the point of view had thus far lasted several weeks and showed no signs of deteriorating. “I’ve got thoughts on an issue, and then I have some information to back those thoughts up. It’s weird.” “I mean, I read a few articles online all the way through, even a couple of really long ones. And I almost left a comment a few times, too,” Woodry added. “It’s kind of crazy, but I think I actually care about the issue.” Woodry told reporters he was recently amazed to discover that he not only found a cable news roundtable on the subject coherent but also took a side in the discussion, an unprecedented level of intellectual involvement for the man who admitted he “[doesn’t] really follow” most matters outside his day-to-day life. “I knew what the people on TV were talking about, even the ones I disagreed with,” said Woodry, noting with astonishment that he felt interested in continuing to watch the televised dialogue instead of flipping to something less mentally demanding. “I not only understood a lot of what I was hearing, but sometimes a response would pop into my head automatically without me having to think about it. I even got a little angry at something someone was saying. Jeez, that’s never happened to me before.” With the exception of a single “like” on a relevant Facebook post, Woodry has reportedly been content to keep his emerging convictions to himself thus far. The man who had never previously identified with any particular cause or social movement suggested, however, that he was open to stating his nascent beliefs to others, perhaps even going so far as to say why he holds such beliefs. “I’m actually at a point where I kind of hope a conversation will naturally drift toward the issue because now I’ve got stuff to say,” said Woodry, who acknowledged that he had not yet gone so far as to prod a conversation in that direction but noted that he was considering doing so. “The thing is, I would be happy to talk about this issue. I’d even say I want to talk about it.” “If this keeps up, I might just flat-out tell people that this thing matters to me,” Woodry continued. In fact, Woodry told reporters that given the completely unexpected nature of his first substantive viewpoint, he wondered if he might suddenly develop earnest opinions on other issues when he least suspected it. “I really didn’t plan to be informed about this issue, so who knows if I’ll start having thoughts on other topics, too?” Woodry said. “I guess this could just keep going and going. Man, how many things can you be concerned about? A hundred? A thousand?” “Jesus, where does this end?” Woodry added. ",1,Man Realizes He Beginning To Stand For Something

Indeed, backpedaling is among the most common actions that Americans perform on a daily basis.” Despite the fact that citizens try to get out of 10,000 things per year, researchers noted that the average American has only four excuses.

"GENEVA—In an effort to explore the complex moral issues surrounding the controversial topic, the world’s leading geneticists gathered at an international conference this week to debate the ethics of cloning human beings and compelling them to fight to the death in a rocky pit for our amusement. According to organizers, the five-day symposium provided luminaries in the field of bioengineering an opportunity to thoughtfully deliberate on the moral dilemma of creating hundreds of genetically identical copies of an individual human, arming them with bladed weapons, and forcing them to violently slaughter each other solely as a captivating pastime for spectators. “Cloning human beings and using various intimidation tactics to coerce the genetic duplicates to battle inside a craggy, dimly lit arena certainly raises numerous ethical questions, but the benefits of cheap, incredibly exciting, blood-drenched brawls outweigh potential violations of moral principles,” biologist Richard K. Phillips said during a panel discussion, arguing that dozens of identical combatants fighting until only one is left standing would provide countless hours of gripping entertainment. “While such practices would assuredly be detrimental to the clones that are ruthlessly beaten to death in the fighting pit, we cannot underestimate the net benefit to humankind at large of watching five unarmed versions of a single man gang up on another indistinguishable genetic copy who, say, had this huge club covered in spikes.” “Or imagine 10 clones of one person in a bout against 10 clones of a different person,” Phillips continued. “I wholeheartedly believe that it is the responsibility of science to advance human society by creating something so fucking cool.” Throughout the conference, the geneticists reportedly participated in numerous roundtable discussions to examine the contentious subject matter, debating whether human individuality would be diminished if, for example, someone dictated which weapons the cloned humans must use while fighting to the death. In addition, scientists contemplated if it was socially misguided to line the battle pits with razor wire and glass shards or if it was intrinsically immoral to charge audiences a fee to watch physically identical combatants participate in the brutal matches. Despite considerable support from the scientific community, critics argued that it was reprehensible and unethical to use clones genetically selected for specific cognitive traits and physical attributes that would lead to greater carnage, such as people who produced higher than normal levels of adrenaline or psychopathic individuals with diminished capacities for empathy. “Not only is it unethical to choose subjects to clone based on their predilection for ruthless and bloodthirsty behavior, but it is undeniably irresponsible to make hundreds of copies of these disturbed individuals,” said geneticist Kenneth Wilson in a keynote speech, warning that cataclysmic consequences would occur if the dangerous clones escaped from the pit. “Do we really want to put our world at risk just for more appealing, aggressive, and barbaric free-for-alls?” “My colleagues in the field seem to have forgotten that human life is precious,” added Wilson. “That’s why it would have a far greater impact to force regular non-cloned individuals to butcher one another for our amusement.” The geneticists reportedly debated a number of related moral questions as well, including the ethical implications of leading individuals blindly into the arena and not informing them that they would be fighting their exact clone until their hood is removed and they see that they’re dueling themselves. The scientists reportedly also explored the virtues of coercing cloned humans to fight younger versions of themselves from 20 years earlier, and formally discussed whether it was right or wrong to secretly transport human clones to a completely different place, like a remote island in the South Pacific, where they would hunt one another with rifles. Proponents of the practice, however, stressed that a great deal of scientific knowledge could be acquired by cloning humans and forcing them to fight to the death, such as learning precisely how a human would look its own clone in the eye while killing it, understanding the potential of the human mind for perpetrating gruesome violence against what is essentially itself, and determining whether spectators would eventually raise objections to replacing the clones’ limbs with axes and swords. “We could learn a considerable amount about making new organs from this cloning process,” said panelist Dr. Sandra Butler. “And, in turn, determine whether it’s possible to put those organs into wounded clones so that they can continue to battle. If successful, that would be a revolutionary advancement for these savage melees.” Advocates for cloning humans and forcing them to mercilessly massacre each other were reportedly in unanimous agreement, however, that the vicious spectacles must be regulated to avoid potential abuses.

"LOS ANGELES—Conceding the time has come to limit the proliferation of new movies that simply rehash old ones, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. have entered bilateral talks to reduce their considerable stockpiles of unproduced reboots, sources confirmed Wednesday. Speaking to reporters after the first day of tense negotiations, members of both sides said that while building up enormous arsenals of remakes has long been their top strategic priority, the number of such revamped sci-fi franchises, action films, buddy comedies, and children’s movies now in development has reached levels that represent an existential threat to the medium of film worldwide. “We recognize that after years of pouring money into the same old material over and over again, we are one misstep away from unleashing something truly awful on our fellow man,” said Universal president Ronald Meyer, explaining that while hundreds upon hundreds of unproduced reboots sit stored in his studio’s vaults, it would only take the release of a single new Hulk film to devastate most of North America. “Should one party ever preemptively unleash an updated  , it would almost certainly be met by the deployment of a redone  , causing an unstoppable chain reaction of similar retaliations across the entire industry.” “We must install fail-safes to avoid a doomsday scenario in which the studios launch all their reboots upon the moviegoing public at the same time,” he added. Universal reportedly made the first diplomatic overtures by proposing remake-limitation talks with Warner executives, who agreed on condition that both studios impose caps on the number of old films they would rerelease in 3D each year. Those close to the negotiations confirmed that Warner Bros. pledged to abandon its planned reboot of   when Universal provided assurances it would scuttle an upcoming sequel to the 1988 Arnold Schwarzenegger–Danny DeVito comedy  . The two studios also consented to dismantle their large-scale programs for identifying potential prequels, according to reports. In addition, Universal and Warner Bros. agreed to begin the careful destruction of their Spider-Man and Superman franchises, respectively, with all scripts for future installments to be fully eliminated by 2029. Despite the progress, sources said negotiations stalled for an entire afternoon when Warner representatives refused to back down from their reboot of   and walked out of the room, vowing they would not cooperate unless Universal immediately committed to pulling its forthcoming adaptation of the video game series  . “A successful drawdown of our treatments for hundreds of films based on 1990s box-office hits and well-trodden comic-book properties will require a high degree of mutual trust,” Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara said. “We would certainly be open to utilizing a third party such as the Motion Picture Association of America to ensure that both sides comply with agreed-upon reductions in reboot numbers and to monitor studio lots to verify that teams of screenwriters are not secretly modernizing any preexisting film script.” Several close calls, most of which have remained hidden from the public, are believed to have provided the impetus for the current round of talks. Anonymous sources cited a particularly disturbing incident in which an erroneous report of an upcoming   reboot from Warner spurred Universal Studios executives to give the order for another live-action  . Only a last-minute phone call between levelheaded producers from both sides is said to have deescalated the situation. “The outcome of these talks will have profound repercussions, with strict reboot limits potentially ushering in a more hopeful future for movie enthusiasts worldwide,” said film historian Arthur Spence, who described the power attained by Warner Bros. in 1947 after a team of producers and attorneys working in secret successfully rebooted the studio’s ailing Rin Tin Tin franchise, touching off a decades-long period in which each major Hollywood studios built vast stores of remake scripts. “The reality of the situation is that, at this moment, thousands of these unmade reboots have already been through the first stage of rewrites, are currently being punched up by script doctors, and could be ready to shoot within a few months. It’s absolutely terrifying.” “These negotiations, however, could greatly reduce the grave threat posed by these unfinished remakes,” he continued. “At long last, it appears these studio heads are finally thinking long and hard about the kind of world they want to leave behind for their children.” While pleased with the steps taken during the first round of discussions, reports indicate that both sides still remain deeply troubled by rogue studio Lionsgate, which many suspect of secretly developing a fifth   treatment.

"NEW YORK—Introducing key changes to the lottery system that governs the admissions process, the New York City Charter School Center notified potential students this week that openings will now be filled by randomly distributing white pills to applicants and enrolling those left standing. In place of the existing electronic lottery system conducted in the spring, education officials explained that applicants would receive identical white pills, among them a small number of innocuous placebos corresponding to the amount of open spots, and then wait approximately 30 minutes to determine the survivors and new charter school enrollees. “With so many deserving students competing for so few spots in the city’s network of high-performing, tuition-free charter schools, our new lottery system ensures that each student is provided with an equal opportunity,” said Eva Moskowitz, the head of the Success Academy chain of 22 charter schools, while mixing up a tub of 118 sugar pills and 2,376 pentobarbital capsules to be blindly administered in an upcoming lottery. “Between small class sizes, longer school days, individualized instruction, and superior college admission rates, charters provide amazing opportunities for students who don’t enter a convulsive state, fall into a coma, stop breathing, and cease all bodily functions during the admissions process.” “Of course it’s heartbreaking for the families of children who aren’t accepted,” Moskowitz continued, “But seeing the look on parents’ faces when their child is still standing in a room littered with rejected applicants is priceless. They know their child is going to get the best possible education.” Administrators told reporters that the new quick and relatively painless lottery system is a welcome alternative to the notoriously long and emotional computerized drawings of past years, where all applicants received a random number and were subjected to waiting for many hours before learning whether they would attend a charter school or return to an inferior public school. Officials confirmed that the innovative selection process has already proved a success, though not without its minor setbacks, in areas of the country where it has already been implemented. “This year we’re making the pills a little stronger because not all the candidates were weeded out right away,” said Tim Bernard of Thrive Academy in Washington, D.C., a public charter that had 200 elementary school students apply for eight open spots last year. “Some kids would seem fine, we’d extend them an official offer of admission, and then a few days later they’d start hallucinating or slurring their speech. Meanwhile parents are scared sick we’re going to rescind their kids’ offers because too many applicants survived.” “Luckily, we worked out all the kinks for this year,” Bernard added. “The body removal crews are already assembled outside the auditoriums and ready to go.” Though charter school officials maintained that the new admissions process is designed fairly, critics claimed many affluent parents have already found ways to exploit the system. For example, after a lottery in Los Angeles ended with a high number of living students, officials discovered that parents had been building up their children’s immunity to the pills by giving them small doses of poison each day, or had hired tutors to help them train their bodies to overcome the effects of the pills. Despite these flaws, many parents said they have no doubts about trying to get their child into a charter. “I went through charter school admissions with my oldest son last year, but after he died I wondered whether it was even worth it to try again with my other kids,” Hoboken, NJ mother Jane Schaal told reporters. “But then my younger daughter got into Achievement First and I knew we made the right decision. There was no way she was going to succeed in public school.” “Next year we’ll try to get my youngest son into a good elementary school,” Schaal added. “He’s not in kindergarten yet, but even if he’s not accepted to a top-notch charter, it’s a relief knowing that his future will be set.” ",1,"New Charter School Lottery System Gives Each Applicant White Pill, Enrolls Whoever Left Standing"

"LOS ANGELES—Often spotted rummaging in backyards or skittering across local streets in tattered designer clothing, a roving pack of feral celebrities continues to plague residents living in the Hollywood Hills, sources confirmed Monday. The mangy film, television, and recording industry stars are reportedly proving a particular nuisance to homeowners, who say they cause property damage and often keep the neighborhoods they prowl awake with their loud, screeching vocalizations. Local business owners have also lodged complaints, saying the filth-covered celebs travel down the hills in groups by night to feed on scraps from dumpsters behind Spago and Chateau Marmont. “Until we get this population under control, we ask that you securely fasten your garbage can lids, and whatever you do, please don’t feed these celebrities or give them any attention—that will only encourage them to return to residential areas,” said neighborhood council president Anastasia Mann, urging residents to contact authorities immediately should they spot an aggressive starlet or litter of reality show contestants holed up underneath their porch or pool house. “In many cases, these stars been abandoned by their agents or handlers. Most have gone years without a role or hit album, which has left them prone to desperate, erratic, and unpredictable behavior. ” “Even though a frail, unkempt Freddie Prinze Jr., for example, may appear to be friendly, do not go near him,” she continued. “There’s no telling what kinds of diseases he may be carrying.” Local property owners said they have seen the nighttime scavengers raiding their bird feeders and digging up kale, chia seeds, and Swiss chard from their gardens, the glow of their beady eyes reportedly visible across darkened lawns. One resident said he recently turned on his outdoor light only to witness a tick-ridden Neve Campbell scurrying away from his trash bin with a half-empty yogurt container between her teeth. Though the exact size of the feral pack is unknown, officials estimate it has grown from roughly a dozen emaciated WB network stars back in 2011 to more than a hundred ravenous screen actors, models, Top 40 singers, and at least a handful of personalities from the World Series of Poker tour. The problem reportedly began drawing more attention last month after a car hit a scruffy, gaunt Skeet Ulrich on Mulholland Drive, and a bedraggled horde of former Disney child stars immediately began swarming his flattened remains. Authorities also confirmed the entire cast of the former NBC show   had recently been found burrowing together for warmth beneath the “D” of the Hollywood sign. “I’d never seen one of those things up close until I found Adam Duritz rooting around in my garage a few months ago,” Aidan Hubbard, 53, told reporters outside his Whitley Heights home, where he said the Counting Crows frontman hissed and bared his teeth at him. “He was just caked in dirt and had grass and leaves in his hair. We discovered he’d been living in our crawl space, and my wife felt so bad she set food out for him. I know they say that only makes the problem worse, but we just couldn’t help but pity the furry little guy. Now I see those things everywhere.” “ ” he added, shooing away a scrawny Denise Richards lurking near his driveway. A number of residents have argued these derelict entertainers need help, noting that many appear to be in urgent need of medical care and a qualified stylist. Some may also require rehabilitation services, given numerous reports of frenzied, disoriented stars finding their way into houses and clawing apart bathrooms in search of prescription drugs. The growing nuisance has raised concerns over neighborhood safety, particularly following an incident in which an unprovoked Hector Elizondo of   fame was seen attacking guests at a backyard barbecue. Officials said the pests pose a threat not only to the community, but to the local ecosystem as well. “Aggressive hunters such as Academy Award winner Geena Davis or  ’s Billy Zane can dramatically alter populations of small mammals, sometimes even snatching pets from their owners’ porches,” said Mann, who noted she no longer allows her Bichon Frise outside alone after a series of vicious encounters with Debra Winger. “Obviously, something must be done soon. Just the other day my neighbor sat down to a breakfast on her patio only to find the bloated carcass of Patrick Duffy floating in their pool.” “The best thing we can do is remain vigilant as we wait for trained casting directors to lure these creatures out of the woods with made-for-TV movie scripts or small cameo roles in studio films,” she continued. “That way they can be coaxed into traps and put down humanely.” ",1,Residents Plagued By Roving Pack Of Feral Celebrities Living In Hollywood Hills

Seriously, we’ll do whatever you want—don’t be afraid to ask.” Economic experts told reporters that the new incentive programs aim to replicate the success achieved by the municipalities of California’s Silicon Valley, which in the 1970s established the area as the world’s technological epicenter by offering production subsidies to anyone who mentioned the word “computer.” ",1,States Now Offering Millions In Tax Breaks To Any Person Who Says ‘High-Tech Jobs’
"LOVELAND, CO—Asserting that he’d given a recent work project everything he had but that it wasn’t quite enough, local office worker Tom Janssen is currently under the impression that he went down fighting, sources reported Monday. “Well, at the end of the day I came up a bit short, but I sure as heck gave it my all,” said an incorrect Janssen, mistakenly identifying his wholly inadequate display of effort on a proposal, which was summarily rejected by his supervisor, as “pushing [himself] to the limit.” “You win some, you lose some.

"CHICAGO—According to a study published this week in the  , the average American has intercourse with upwards of 9 million imagined sexual partners over the course of his or her lifetime. “From their teenage years onward, most individuals have hundreds of thousands of fantasized sexual partners every year, beginning with attractive teachers and classmates, and eventually expanding to wholly dreamt-up relations with good-looking coworkers or people on the subway,” said lead researcher Kevin Douglas, adding that even married individuals had upwards of 4 million completely imagined sexual partners outside of wedlock. “And the factor of age is minimal, as people well into their golden years were more than capable of sexual intercourse with dozens of partners in their mind every single day.” Douglas added that a significant proportion of Americans also conjured up sexual relations with two or more partners simultaneously 2.5 million times.

"ROCHESTER, MN—A comprehensive five-year study conducted by researchers at the Mayo Clinic has identified a strong link between heavy drinking during pregnancy and attending a public performance by Detroit-based rap-rocker Kid Rock, officials confirmed Wednesday. “Our survey found that expectant mothers who consumed hard liquor were far more likely to be at a Kid Rock concert than a control group who did not drink,” said Dr. Lawrence Talmage, whose research also indicated that 78.3 percent of women who drank to intoxication while pregnant were wearing shredded T-shirts and riding atop the presumed father’s shoulders during encores of “All Summer Long” and “Bawitdaba.” “Across all three trimesters, drinking three or more alcoholic beverages in less than an hour was highly correlated with going backstage at a Kid Rock show and then getting into a fistfight with another woman in the parking lot.” The study also suggested that combining recreational drug use with drinking during pregnancy made women twice as likely to scream “Sign my titty!” outside the band’s tour bus.

"WASHINGTON—In an effort to reverse the adverse effects caused by years of neglect, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a plan Friday to drastically improve conditions for the nation’s sludge. “Our new set of stewardship initiatives will ensure the speedy restoration of sludge in ecosystems all across the country,” said EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, explaining that the public and private sectors would collaborate on the massive, nationwide undertaking in urban and rural areas to set aside rivers, lakes, and ditches where the fetid, virulent slurry can spread out and roam free. “Whether it’s the byproduct of sewage treatment, petroleum refining, or common industrial runoff, we are committed to a long-term conservation effort to provide sanctuaries for sludge of all kinds while also putting controls in place for sludge to continue flourishing unharmed. Our nation’s precious sludge is some of the best in the world, and it’s up to us to keep it that way.” Pruitt went on to say that the preservation of the country’s sludge will require the active participation of all Americans, and he was more than confident that they would rise to the occasion.

"THE HEAVENS—Calling it one of the greatest mysteries in life, the Lord God Almighty, Our Heavenly Father, admitted Wednesday that He often wonders what happens to human beings after they die. The Creator of Heaven and Earth, who said He has often grappled over the millennia with the uncomfortable reality that humans never come back after they die, told reporters He had “absolutely no idea” what, if anything, people experience once their vital organs permanently cease to function. “Some say that when people die, that’s the end, but who knows?” said the Supreme Being, adding that no one in the world could say with any degree of certainty whether one’s existence completely ceases with death. “Others say that at the moment they die, people walk toward a bright light and into another world, but the thing is, only the people who die are the ones who know. I just know that it would be awfully sad to think that when they pass on they’re gone forever.” “I want to believe that human beings continue on in some form after their deaths,” He continued, “but who am I to say, really?” The God of Abraham said that the varied religious and spiritual beliefs about the afterlife held by His 7.1 billion human creations were “nothing more than speculation,” before noting that He doesn’t think science and philosophy have all the answers, either. He emphasized that He understands intellectually that human beings are physical things that He made from atoms like everything else, but that He couldn’t help but wonder if they each also possessed some unique eternal essence that continued living on after their bodies died. He Who Commanded Light to Shine Out of Darkness went on to state that accepting death as a natural part of human life did not make it any less frightening for Him to contemplate, remarking that it was “pretty scary” to think that once the people He brought into this world die, He might never see them again. “Of course it’s comforting to imagine that [Cincinnati resident] Doris [Hughes], [Volgograd, Russia, resident] Mikhail [Pavlychko], and [Derby, U.K., resident] Fran [Grimmell] are smiling down on me from somewhere,” the Divine Creator said. “If I’m being honest with myself, though, I really can’t say where any of those people are now.” “That’s the troubling thing,” He added. “They’re living and breathing one minute with all their thoughts and desires known to me, and then they’re gone forever the next.” Concluding that when it came to what He described as “the great, unknowable beyond” His guess was “as good as anyone’s,” the Lord said there was no point in worrying too much about such an inscrutable thing. “My view—take it or leave it—is that you can talk and argue as much as you want about death, but when it comes down to it, all anyone can do is guess what’s on the other side,” God Almighty said. “In the meantime, humans should enjoy themselves, try to live honestly, be good to one another, and make the most of their time on earth.” “Because, like it or not, I’ll end all of their lives sooner or later,” He added. “There’s simply no escaping that.” ",1,God Wonders What Happens To Humans After They Die
"WASHINGTON—In what is being called one of the greatest disasters of its kind, millions of gallons of oil began spilling into Washington on Friday following a rupture in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. “There’s been a failure in his containment system, and now oil is gushing out of his left shoulder at a rate of 5,000 barrels per day,” said chief rig operator Kevin Sullivan, adding that having the senior cabinet official in such a heavily inhabited area was an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen, as the 65-year-old former ExxonMobil CEO should have been decommissioned years ago due to his age and deterioration. “We first tried putting a containment dome over him, but after that failed, we began airlifting affected citizens out of the greater Washington area and then removing the oil via controlled burns, while using remotely operated vehicles to plug Tillerson with cement. Cleanup crews are working around the clock to alleviate the damage, but we project the losses from this disaster to be in the billions, not to mention the grave impact it will have on the ecology of the region.” At press time, the disaster relief team had successfully managed to divert some of the flow to EPA administrator Scott Pruitt.

"When Donald Trump asked me to be his secretary of state, I was honored to be given such an extraordinary opportunity to serve my country. I was confident I could transition from my job as the CEO of ExxonMobil to become America’s chief diplomat. But after 10 months in my new role, I’m beginning to think that maybe settling complicated disputes between historically hostile groups of people is quite a bit different than drilling for oil. As it turns out, the two occupations really don’t have much in common at all. Discovering new oil reserves and finding ways to extract them is one thing, but serving as a mediator in foreign conflicts between dozens of warring factions whose discord goes back years, if not centuries, is actually another thing entirely. I figured the four decades I spent locating places to drill for oil would translate extremely well to navigating the complex histories of other cultures in order to negotiate delicate compromises that prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. I thought there would be some similarities there, but apparently that’s just not the case. Seriously, I was way off on that one. Truth be told, when I walked into the State Department on Day 1, I was convinced I’d be well-equipped to deal with ISIS and Bashar al-Assad in Syria, having previously worked with submersible pumps to draw hydrocarbons buried deep within the earth up to the surface for eventual refinement and sale. But come to find out, bringing peace to Syria has a lot to do with understanding the dozens of shifting alliances between various government forces, armed rebel groups, and supranational jihadist militants, and very little to do with, say, selecting the proper drilling fluid. I know that now. I’m really very sorry. In retrospect, this should have become clear to me much sooner. When I met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi back in March, he kept talking to me about strategies to rein in Kim Jong-un’s nuclear program, and I kept waiting for the discussion to turn to techniques for boring through bedrock to find hidden caches of petroleum. Well, it never did. To be honest, I’m not really sure why I thought it would.  To be sure, there are times during diplomatic negotiations when oil   come up. Just last month, when I visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar, oil was alluded to on multiple occasions. But it was really only mentioned in passing. Any time I tried to dive into specifics like surveying an area for potential sources of oil, conducting seismic tests to find underground reservoirs, setting up rigs, drilling multilateral wells, or injecting steam into fields to extract heavier crude, none of the other diplomats at the table showed much interest. In fact, pretty much every time I bring up the subject of oil these days, people seem to want to talk about something else. Look, I never thought absolutely crucial tasks like going to the U.N. to address the representatives of the nations that are party to the Iran nuclear deal would be easy. I just thought it would be a lot like drilling for oil or, at the very least, distributing petroleum products to the 11,000 ExxonMobil-branded service stations across the United States. But it isn’t, so I’m kind of at a loss here. The more I think about it, though, there is one similarity: If I really screw up a diplomatic dispute, we’re ultimately going to just walk away from it, same as we do with an oil spill.

"WASHINGTON—Capping off a packed week of weighing options and giving serious thought, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent a busy day in Washington fueling speculation and not ruling things out, her spokesman confirmed today. “After dedicating a few hours in the morning to drawing a lot of focus, laying groundwork, and calculating risks, Mrs. Clinton conducted a full afternoon of taking stock of and thinking it through, as well as several hours of careful considering,” Clinton press aide Nick Merrill said of the 66-year-old’s breakneck schedule of entertaining various possibilities and seeing all sides. “Between looking ahead and setting the stage, Mrs. Clinton has been putting in 18-hour days of late.

I’m good to go.’ No, this is where I should be.” After several more minutes of silent contemplation, sources reported that Parker convinced himself that he had, in fact, finished vomiting, a position he later reversed in the hallway.

"WASHINGTON—Announcing one of the broadest reforms to the nation’s energy policy in decades, the Environmental Protection Agency introduced sweeping new regulations Monday that will require all power plants to find 30 percent more loopholes by the year 2030. “By setting this strict regulatory standard, we are ensuring that the operators of fossil-fuel power plants take proactive steps to uncover and exploit even more technicalities and exemptions in the federal code in the coming decades,” said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, who pointed to strict loophole quotas that will force electrical utilities to pursue more efficient ways of bypassing rules, prompting a boom in energy sector research into how to take advantage of flexible state-by-state deadlines and ways to grandfather in exemptions for particular coal-burning plants. “The country’s power facilities must adopt a drastic new approach when it comes to how they deftly slide around environmental law. Through utilizing new and inventive means of circumventing the requirements—including innovations in legal maneuvering that tie the new rules up in the courts for years—these polluters will be able to finagle a way to continue releasing carbon dioxide, mercury, and other toxins into the air for the foreseeable future.” McCarthy stated that the EPA’s new regulations would cost the energy industry between $7.3 billion and $8.8 billion annually over the next few years, primarily in political donations to candidates who will ensure the regulations are fully repealed.

"YALTA, CRIMEA—In what is being called the worst environmental disaster in the region’s history, millions of policy proposals gushed into the Black Sea on Thursday after a Brookings Institution think tanker ran aground off the coast of Crimea. “Cleanup crews are working around the clock to contain this massive flood of position papers on economics and global development,” said Brookings Institution president Strobe Talbott, adding that booms had been brought to the site to halt the spread of the nonpartisan research while skimmers had been deployed to collect the policy briefs from the ocean’s surface in hopes of preventing currents from dispersing them over a far greater area. “We’re doing our very best to limit the exposure of marine habitats to the analyses of sub-Saharan energy infrastructure, universal basic income, and automation in the labor market, but it could be months before we know the full extent of the damage.” Talbott went on to say that the Brookings Institution had already pledged $200 million toward cleanup efforts thanks to generous donations from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Hutchins Family Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. ",1,Millions Of Policy Proposals Spill Into Sea As Brookings Institution Think Tanker Runs Aground Off Crimea Coast
"WASHINGTON—In an effort to guarantee Americans the freedom to pick whichever mode of rapid ecological decay they desire, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back federal emissions standards Friday to provide consumers with a broader choice over the type of apocalyptic hellscape Earth will inevitably become. “Bleak, post-industrial garbage desert, nightmarish inferno of eternal noxious flames, or glowing green toxic acid swamp—no matter which unsurvivable wasteland you favor, eliminating fuel economy and automotive emissions standards will provide car buyers far more options as to how their imminent dystopias will look,” said EPA chief Scott Pruitt, who said current burdensome auto industry regulations unfairly limit consumer choices between the human race dying in uninhabitable stretches of desert as far as the eye can see, drowning in an unending series of massive tsunamis, or slowly degrading into a genetically corrupt pseudo-race dwelling in cities overrun by half-human mutant predators. “While some people want a world where every man, woman, and child on the planet dissolves to the bone within seconds of being exposed to a corrosive atmosphere, others prefer Earth to become a land ruled by leather-clad warlords leading tribes of diseased and malnourished warriors into battle over the last few remaining drops of petroleum. The decision of how to best leave the planet a charred and blackened husk must be made by the American people and not the federal government.” According to sources, a protesting California is expected to stick with stricter standards, thereby restricting consumers to choose between a few basic hellscapes shrouded beneath jet-black clouds of poisonous exhaust.

"NEW HAVEN, CT—At a loss to explain the mysterious nature of the president’s powers, political scientists were reportedly baffled Wednesday by Donald Trump’s ability to end the practice of separating families who cross the U.S. border seeking asylum mere days after stating that he had no control over it. “Just yesterday, he was explaining that his hands were tied and there was nothing he could do to stop children and infants from being forcibly torn away from their parents and put into cages—but then today, out of nowhere, he suddenly issued an executive order doing just that!” said Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional law professor at Yale University, remarking that this inexplicable development will fundamentally upend how the presidency is understood, because there is no theory in the entire field of political science that explains how it could be possible. “No new amendments to the Constitution have been passed, so the powers vested in the Executive Branch should be the same today as they were yesterday, right? And yet somehow, they have changed! Decades of research will be required before we can even begin to comprehend such a phenomenon. In the meantime, we can only sit back and wonder if there are any other powers the president has yet to discover.” At press time, sources confirmed Ackerman and his colleagues had flipped over an original copy of the Constitution and found a list of previously unknown executive powers that appeared to have been hastily scrawled in with a ballpoint pen.  ",1,Political Scientists Baffled By Trump’s Ability To End Something He Had No Control Over Just Days Ago
"WASHINGTON—Urging a return to civility amid a contentious confirmation fight, GOP officials called Thursday for calmer, more reasonable death threats to be made toward Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser. “We understand there’s a lot of controversy around this, but she still deserves to have people threaten to kill her in a polite way,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who added that cooler heads must prevail, especially when dealing with a situation as delicate as taunting the accuser by vowing to broadcast her family’s home address. “It’s important for us to maintain a sense of decorum. Now, that doesn’t mean we have to stop sending graphic emails—it just means we should tone down the rhetoric about mutilating her corpse. You should always take the high road and leave her children out of this. Remember, there’s really no need to use misogynistic slurs such as ‘bitch’ when ‘lying whore’ will suffice.” At press time, Grassley reiterated that a “true conservative” would terrorize her in a way that would “make our founding fathers proud.” ",1,"GOP Officials Urge Calmer, More Reasonable Death Threats Toward Kavanaugh Accuser"
"WASHINGTON—Denying that any attempt had been made to withhold information relevant to the Supreme Court confirmation process, Senate Republicans promised Wednesday there would be plenty of time to review Brett Kavanaugh’s writings once they had become the law of the land. “We’ll have an opportunity to thoroughly vet Judge Kavanaugh’s beliefs as soon as they are established precedent and a permanent part of our nation’s legal framework,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, explaining there was no need for anyone to read Kavanaugh’s thoughts on the environment or immigration since they would be readily available to the public once he sat on the Supreme Court and began issuing opinions. “The Democrats will have decades to closely analyze Judge Kavanaugh’s views on issues such as labor unions, gerrymandering, and executive power. Why should they read a million documents from his time in the George W. Bush administration when they will be able to find out most of what they need to know just by reading his majority opinion striking down  ?” McConnell added that Democratic criticism of Trump’s nominee represented the “same old obstructionist tactics” that in 2032 the Supreme Court will rule is legally punishable by death.  ",1,Senate Republicans Promise There Will Be Plenty Of Time To Review Kavanaugh Writings When They Become Law Of Land

"WASHINGTON—Claiming that her refusal to appear before them and testify called into question all of her accusations, GOP officials attacked Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford for never coming forward during Thursday’s public hearing. “Dr. Ford was extremely disrespectful by refusing to show up today. We set up this hearing and sat there for hours waiting, yet we didn’t hear a single word from her,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, who claimed the Senate now had no choice but to move forward on the confirmation vote since Ford had outright refused to publicly defend her allegations or even enter the Capitol Building. “Her absence clearly discredits her entire story. Brett Kavanaugh was brave enough to show up, he spoke very clearly and eloquently, and everyone here carefully listened to what he had to say. My colleagues sacrificed their time and energy to prepare a number of important questions and waited around, but we just got crickets.” Grassley added that it was completely unprofessional for his Democratic colleagues Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Mazie Hirono to skip the hearing as well.

"HAWTHORNE, CA—Citing their experiences watching recent World Cups, MLS matches, and various youth soccer games, every patron at O’Brien’s Pub offered a different, incorrect definition of the sport’s notoriously nebulous “offside” ruling. “One guy’s saying that if you pass the ball across two lines, it’s offside, but his buddy is arguing that if you can get it across the center line, it’s not offside unless you then get a scoring chance. Me? I don’t know,” said bartender Casey Walker, struggling to be heard over a customer loudly and erroneously insisting that a player cannot run past a member of the opposing team at any point, even if that player is in possession of the ball. “What we all agreed sounded correct was that if a player on the attacking side enters the offensive zone before the ball, and anyone on that player’s side touches the ball before it leaves the offensive zone, that’s offside.

"ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, MEXICO—Following the drug kingpin’s recent escape from the maximum security facility, Arturo Terrazas, warden of the Altiplano prison in central Mexico, vowed Monday to take away Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s tunnel privileges if he is captured. “Here at Altiplano, prisoners must earn their access to any of our mile-long electrically lit and ventilated subterranean passageways, and I can assure you that Mr. Guzman will be forfeiting this right once he is taken into custody and reincarcerated,” Terrazas told reporters, adding that Guzman will also be expressly prohibited from renting out any power tools or dollies from the prison workshop as part of the additional punitive measures he will face if he is apprehended. “Mr. Guzman will need to establish a long track record of good behavior before we even consider reinstating his daily visits to the tunnel system that connects the prison grounds with various homes surrounding the complex. Of course, even then we will restrict him to 60-minute sessions conducted after the rest of our resident population has finished using the underground corridors themselves.” Terrazas concluded that, while Guzman must be disciplined, he believes it would be inhumane to also deprive the cartel leader of his ventilation duct hours.

"WASHINGTON—Saying the website has mounted a direct assault on free speech, Republicans in Congress told reporters Tuesday they were outraged by reports claiming the pornographic video site RedTube has censored conservative voices on its platform. “Sadly, RedTube displays a consistent left-leaning bias, whether through its temporary ban of outspoken Republican porn star Cindy Lixxx’s popular ‘Spread Bald Eagle’ channel or its hiding of search results for phrases such as ‘Stars and Stripes double penetration,’” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA), who echoed dozens of GOP lawmakers as he argued that such actions not only suppress important voices, but also discriminate against conservative viewers who simply want to see bondage scenes of right-wing cam girls blindfolded and bound with the American flag. “RedTube operates a widely used public forum for the exchange of hardcore materials, and it should not be allowed to determine whether Americans are permitted to watch rock-hard Republicans cuming on the tits of fiscally conservative adult film stars. Otherwise, before you know it, the only pornographic videos online will be liberal bukkake or—I shudder to even say it—socialist gang bangs.” In response, a RedTube spokesperson cited the company’s history of providing a neutral platform and pointed to its long-running offerings favored by establishment Republicans, including the premium pornography channel, “Bush.” ",1,Republicans Outraged Over RedTube Censoring Of Conservative Voices
"WASHINGTON—In a move that experts believe could upend the confirmation of President Trump’s second Supreme Court justice, the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh had reportedly begun to falter Friday after   published a shocking editorial claiming he neglected to attend his eldest daughter’s piano recital in the fall of 2013. “This is exactly the sort of bombshell that a lot of conservative analysts have been worried about,” said NPR political reporter Asma Khalid, noting that several key Republican senators were questioning their endorsement after learning the D.C. Circuit judge had flagrantly decided to work late at the office instead of listening to his then-8-year-old daughter plunk out “The Sleepy Cat” for an audience of students, parents, and faculty. “Susan Collins of Maine, for instance, has already signaled that she has serious doubts about Kavanaugh’s commitment to protecting women’s rights if, as reported, it took him until the following morning to view the iPad footage of his own daughter’s culminating musical performance. Though supporters will claim he put the wrong date in his Google calendar or that he ran into traffic on the way to the school, this black mark on his record has many concerned that Kavanaugh simply does not have the judgment or moral integrity to serve on the nation’s highest court.” Khalid also cautioned that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be counted out entirely, pointing to a blistering   opinion piece that failed to derail Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination despite persuasively arguing that she is of Hispanic descent.

"WICHITA, KS—Expressing their displeasure that the Supreme Court nominee had failed to warn them about a factor that could harm his candidacy, the Koch brothers were reportedly furious Monday that Brett Kavanaugh never disclosed that the nation might care about sexual abuse. “When we agreed to spend millions of dollars toward his confirmation, we never believed Kavanaugh would’ve withheld important information from us like the fact that being a sexual predator could someday have consequences,” said an angry Charles Koch, adding that his advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, would not have committed money to supporting Kavanaugh if he had come clean about the recent shift in America’s societal conscience that held some men credibly accused of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions. “Look, we’ve been building up Kavanaugh’s resume and qualifications for decades, and not once did he make any sort of suggestion that committing a nonconsensual sexual act on another person could be a problem in the United States. We would have never put him on our shortlist for the nation’s highest court if we knew the American people would ever pay attention to this or that it could have any adverse effect.” The Koch brothers added that they were already putting a more strenuous vetting process into place, stating that they were now asking candidates if the nation would ever care about racism.

In fact, I actually majored in sports medicine.” Kavanaugh went on to note that despite not knowing exactly how the Supreme Court functioned, he was sure he would pick up on most of the U.S. judicial system’s quirks after a few weeks on the job.

It’s a long shot, sure, but then again, there’s no way I’ll be good enough to play for Germany’s senior team, so this will probably be the only way I can go to a World Cup.” Köhler went on to express his confidence that despite his mediocre touch and middling passing ability, he could likely win a spot on the U.S. roster in time for the 2018 World Cup.

"WASHINGTON, DC—Confusion and disbelief reigned at the White House after President Bush announced Monday that an Arizona man, known to authorities only as H4xX0r1337, stole his identity and used it to buy electronic goods, veto a bill, and meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox. ""This is incredibly frustrating,"" Bush told reporters Tuesday. ""Not only does this guy have my credit-card information, he has my Social Security number, all my personal information, and the launch codes for a number of ballistic intercontinental nuclear missiles. I almost don't want to think about it."" ""I feel so violated,"" Bush added. Bush said he has canceled his credit cards and changed the national-security codes, but he labeled the process a ""total nightmare."" ""It's a huge ordeal,"" Bush said. ""Everything will be straightened out eventually, but my credit rating and political capital are down the tubes. I asked the FBI, and they aren't even sure how long this guy's had my identity. For all I know, he's started up his own oil refinery somewhere in Alaska."" Bush said he began to suspect something was wrong when he received a card from Sen. Bill Frist, thanking him for vetoing the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act of 2005. ""I thought I was going crazy,"" Bush said. ""I had no recollection of even reading that piece of legislation, much less killing it. At first, I thought Frist had things mixed up, but I checked the records, and sure enough, someone with my credentials came into the White House in late March while I was on my ranch and vetoed that bill."" Bush said he only recognized the full magnitude of the problem last Tuesday, when Mexican President Fox called to thank him for the ""incredibly positive and productive summit."" ""Vicente said I had agreed to an aid package for his country,"" Bush said. ""It was like I was in cuckoo-land. That's when I called [FBI Director Robert] Mueller. I said, 'You may want to sit down for this one, Bob. I think someone stole my identity.'"" According to Mueller, examining Bush's recent outgoing e-mail led him to believe that the president's identity was probably stolen about five weeks ago, when he responded to an e-mail from paypal783@hotmail.com asking him to comply with PayPal security measures by entering all 12 of his credit-card numbers, his Social Security number, his passwords, and his personal identification numbers. ""It appears that the president is among the many thousands of Americans who have fallen for so-called 'phishing' scams,"" Mueller said. ""One should never give out sensitive personal information in response to an e-mail. If the president had read the memo we sent out a few months ago, he would have known that."" Although the FBI has traced H4xX0r1337's now-defunct ISP account to a Mail Boxes, Etc. mailbox in Tempe, AZ, Mueller said apprehending H4xX0r1337 may prove more difficult. ""Identity thieves and hackers are notoriously difficult to locate,"" Mueller said. ""They are often highly intelligent and very skilled at covering their tracks. Making it more difficult, H4xX0r1337 seems to have used his credentials to commandeer Air Force One. At this moment, he could be anywhere in the world."" Bush said he will likely need to spend the entire week reclaiming his identity, adding that he wished to thank everyone who has already assisted him in the process. ""The FBI has been working tirelessly to find this man who hides in the shadows and perpetrates computer terrorism,"" Bush said. ""I'd also like to thank Debrina at Bank One's customer-service center. She was very courteous and super helpful."" This is not the first time a hacker has stolen the identity of a political figure.

"NEW YORK—In an effort to raise the individual American's awareness of and interest in advertising, the National Advertising Board launched a $32-million ""Advertising: Get The Message!"" campaign in major markets across the country Monday.
 ""From lifesaving drugs to new diet beverages, advertising keeps you informed about the products and services you want to buy,"" a spokeswoman said in a 30-second spot titled ""Keep An Eye Out For Ads."" ""But advertising can't work for you if you don't pay attention!""
 The commercials, in heavy rotation on network and cable television, end with a helpful tip for viewers: ""To get messages from advertisers in your area, open up your local newspaper, turn on your radio, or continue to watch this channel.""
 The NAB campaign includes print, radio, television, and billboard ads.
 A print ad appearing in 15 leading women's magazines this month reads, ""Whether you need a new, improved detergent with stain-dissolving power or a low-interest equity loan for making home improvements, advertising can help. Why not look at some advertising today?""
 The new campaign targeted American males, as well.
 ""You're a man,"" an advertisement in   read. ""Take your life into your own hands—with advertising. If you're looking for sporting goods, hair products, or pornography, ads will bring you closer to your goal. Advertising—get the message!""
 According to NAB spokeswoman Alaina Gray, the goal of the print advertisements is twofold.
 ""Primarily, we want to raise awareness of our new 'Get The Message' slogan,"" Gray said. ""But we also hope that, by drawing attention to our ads, we'll attract more interest to all ads. That's why many of our print ads urge consumers to look to the right and left of our advertisement for other advertisements.""
 Many consumers have taken the NAB's new message to heart.
 ""Just the other day, I was wondering what video game I would buy next,"" said Omaha, NE resident John Cruise, who saw an NAB commercial in the current issue of  . ""I looked at a few of the other full-page color advertisements in the magazine I was holding, and sure enough, the ads made me want a whole bunch of games.""
 Christina Williamson, former vice president of Chiat/Day and current NAB director, said the organization labored for six months to create their ""Get The Message!"" message.
 ""As you can imagine, we focus-grouped this campaign extensively, and we saw some really positive results,"" Williamson said. ""These days, people are looking for messages, so the word 'message' in our 'Get The Message' slogan really resonated with our target demographic—consumers of goods and services. We expect the new campaign to be even more successful than our 2004 campaign, 'Advertising: Look At It.'""
 In a full-page ""Open Letter To American Consumers"" in Sunday's  , Williamson wrote that ""despite the massive efforts of advertising agencies to analyze and exploit human psychology, advertising is more art than science.""
 ""Advertising livens up television programs and brightens magazines, neither of which would exist without advertising,"" Williamson wrote. ""Innovative advertising forms like the magalogue, the infomercial, and advertainment are breathing new life into the industry. If you're hungry for information or looking for a quick laugh, look no further than advertising."" ",1,National Advertising Board Launches 'Advertising: Get The Message!' Campaign
"YPSILANTI, MI—Due to outside influence and unforeseen events, the having-one-beer plan that 29-year-old Keith Flemming devised at the outset of Monday evening went awry.
 ""This is a one-beer night,"" Flemming told his friend Sam Galveston as the two approached their usual booth at Fitzgerald's Tavern. ""I wanna be in bed early, so I have time for a quick drink and some laughs, but that's it. I'm not going on a tear or anything.""
 Flemming, a sales representative for a boutique food packager, ordered a round of Bud Lights at 7:30 p.m. As the two friends drank their beers and discussed their summer-vacation plans, Flemming was well-positioned to meet his goal of being in bed by 10 p.m. 
 Shortly before requesting the check, however, Flemming briefly placed Galveston in charge of the itinerary.
 ""I gotta take a leak,"" Flemming said. ""You know what they say about beer: You don't buy it, you rent it."" 
 While Flemming was in the restroom, Galveston ordered a second round for the pair, thus causing Flemming's plan for the evening to go slightly askew.
 ""Well, I can't let this to go to waste,"" said Flemming, holding the beer up and chuckling. ""After this, though, I have to get out of here. I gotta be up at 6 in the morning. Big day. Inventory.""
 Had events not conspired against him, Flemming could well have finished his second beer and still arrived home before 9 p.m. His plan was thwarted, however, when Gary Greely, a longtime acquaintance of Flemming and Galveston, approached the booth. 
 ""Gary! Long time no see,"" Flemming said. ""I gotta take off soon, but let me get you a beer first. We got some catching up to do.""
 Two hours and an unforeseen buyback later, the early-to-bed plan Flemming had established at the beginning of the evening was in serious jeopardy.
 Flemming purchased ""one last round"" for the table at 10:35 p.m., but in order to get home for his revised bedtime of 11 p.m., Flemming drank the beer in 10 minutes—an act that caused further wavering in his resolve to leave the bar.
 ""Guys, I really should get going, I guess,"" said Flemming, slurring his words. ""I really should probably… I got something I gotta do tomorrow, something at work early.""
 Flemming stood and began to gather his belongings and say goodbye to his friends. Greely, however, began to chant ""shots,"" and the plan for the evening went off-track again.
 ""No Jaeger, though, man,"" said Flemming, returning to his seat. ""Last time I drank Jaeger, I was hung over for days. No way.""
 ""All right, but if I puke, you're cleaning it up!"" Flemming added.
 The three finally said their goodbyes and parted at 2:00 a.m., whereupon Flemming completed his evening in a manner wholly unanticipated—by vomiting, drinking several glasses of water, and falling asleep fully clothed on top of his covers.
 ""I only went to work today because I couldn't miss inventory,"" Flemming said Tuesday morning. ""I don't even remember getting home last night. I know I didn't drive, because my car wasn't around this morning. I guess I took a cab. Christ. Honestly, that's the last time I do that. Next time, I'll go to the bar and hang out, but I'll just have a soda."" ",1,Having-One-Beer Plan Goes Awry

"DANVILLE, IL—People fall in love every day, but self-proclaimed ""Goth for life"" Danielle Richardson, 24, and avid metal-music fan Rick Halloway, 26, faced bigger obstacles than most couples. In spite of having come from vastly different subcultural groups, the unlikely couple celebrated their three-month anniversary Monday. ""It hasn't been easy dating someone so totally different,"" said Halloway, wearing faded black jeans and a Mastodon T-shirt. ""There have been times, like when Dani asked who Phil Anselmo was, that I almost wanted to say 'forget this bullshit.' But then I reminded myself that nothing good is ever easy. That's why I chose the path of metal—living fast and rocking hard. I never in my craziest dreams thought that path would lead me to Dani, but I'm so glad it did."" Added Halloway: ""Fuckin' A, she totally rocks."" Richardson said that, although she has lived her whole life in the same small, largely middle-class Midwestern town as Halloway, the two couldn't be more different. While Halloway spends his free time fixing his car or plugging the jukebox at T.J.'s Tap, Richardson spends her free time shopping at thrift stores and reading poetry at The Black Cat, a red-velvet-curtained bar nearly 10 blocks away from T. J.'s. ""No one is more surprised by our union than I,"" Richardson said. ""When we met, there was a strong attraction, but so much more is required for lasting love. I never believed one such as Rick could touch my shadowed heart, but touch it he has."" Halloway admitted that the relationship got off to a shaky start. ""Me and some of my friends were hanging out in front of the Midas when Dani walked by with a big, black umbrella,"" Halloway said. ""Well, it wasn't raining, so my friends started making fun of her. But when she looked over, our eyes locked. I was like, 'Whoa.'"" A few days later, Halloway ran into Richardson at the Danville Cineplex. ""I asked her what she was going to see—I think it was that gay-ass   movie,"" Halloway said. ""Danielle was wearing this weird black lacy thing. I like women who wear black, but usually it's leather with studs. But something about her made me wait for her after my movie got out. I'm so glad I did."" Richardson said she began dating Halloway with serious reservations. ""Our first date was positively chilling—Rick's soul seemed to be crying out to me,"" Richardson said. ""Still, it brought me much pain to realize that we would have no future together—we were so very different."" ""But at the end of the night, when I reached out to take Rick's hand, I noticed that his fingernails were painted black,"" Richardson added. ""I told him how sexy it was, and he told me he got the idea from a Danzig video. That was the first time I realized we had something deep and eternal in common."" Although he had similar doubts, Halloway said he ""decided to say 'fuck it' and go for it."" ""On our next date, Danielle took me to this place where a house had burned to the ground—the whole place was all scorched and shit,"" Halloway said. ""It looked like a Sepultura video. It was such a kickass spot that we started making out like animals."" Continued Halloway: ""For a girl who writes poetry, Danielle is a totally crazed hell-demon in the sack. She tears the shit out of my back. She's a righteous chick, even if she doesn't like me calling her that."" Although the couple overcame subcultural differences, their friends have not been so open-minded. ""I thought Danielle was just trying to get a reaction from us by going out with some loser,"" said Valerie Brasher, a longtime Goth. ""I could see how our outrage might be delicious to her, but now, she actually seems serious about Rick. This lunacy makes my mind swim with sadness."" ""Danielle will always be very dear to me, but I can't support that relationship,"" Brasher added. ""Once, I suggested that Rick wax his goatee into a tapered, devilish point and he told me to keep my pale-ass freak hands to myself. I mean, talk about your typical close-minded metalhead vulgarian behavior."" Halloway's friends have similarly disparaged the union. ""I told Rick that there's a reason why, when we were all in high school, our friends would hang out under the bleachers and the Goths would hang out in the atrium,"" Mike Kryzinski said. ""It was because our kinds don't get along. What's gonna happen at their wedding when Danielle starts playing Sisters Of Mercy or some shit like that? What kind of music are their kids gonna listen to? Hasn't he ever stopped and thought about the future?"" ",1,"Goth, Metalhead Overcome Subcultural Differences To Find Love"
"If you're considering starting your own business, keep a few things in mind. First, you can't call in sick, and you may have to work very long hours, even if no customers show up for the entire day. Second, be prepared for weeks, or even months, to go by before you clear $50 a week in sales. Third, consider that you may have to rethink your business plan, even though you devoted a whole month to creating it.
 I gotta say, Jeanketeers, after two months of helping my dad run his Off-Season Santa store, I'm ready to throw in the towel—and the giant plastic candy canes, and the colored lights, and anything else in our store that isn't nailed down! Frankly, Dad and I overestimated the level of year-round yuletide cheer in our community. We're lucky if we get three serious customers a day (and by serious, I mean people willing to pose for a photo with Dad/Santa or buy a Christmas knickknack). Mostly, Dad and I sit around in our costumes playing Go Fish and Crazy Eights.
 I don't get it. We've made Santa Claus' lap available seven days a week, 365 days a year, but no one seems to care! You'd think, what with the war, that people would be chomping at the bit for a little whimsy and delight! True, we're located in a dilapidated strip mall in a seedy part of town, but people have cars, don't they? I suppose if we hung signs saying ""Swear With Santa!"" or ""Watch Porn With Santa!"" the line would stretch around the block. Well, Dad and I discussed it, and we refuse to stoop to that level. 
 Dad and I are both dreamers. We've always taken the road less traveled, and since that road has its share of ""Expect Delays"" signs, patience is a must! But lately, even good-natured ol' Dad has expressed serious doubts. ""I've had lot of businesses fail,"" Dad said yesterday. ""But those businesses were failures on paper, not due to a lack of customers. Never has one been so dead.""
 At first, we figured business would pick up once we ironed out the kinks. The fake plastic snow on the floor turned from white to brown and started collecting in the wheel wells of Dad's Rascal, so I replaced it with polyurethane batting, sprinkled it with glitter, and fenced it off with patio stones and a row of wicker reindeer. 
 Dad's scooter seemed to be scaring away children, so I created some very elaborate (and very darling, if I do say so myself!) sleigh cutouts out of foam board. I linked the cutouts together with Velcro and secured them to Dad's scooter. I even sewed a red plush cover to conceal the gray leather seat! You'd practically need X-ray vision to see that Dad is riding a three-wheeled mobility scooter, after that festive treatment.
 Continuing on my creative tear, I designed a new costume for myself. Using chicken wire, strips of paper, and torn pieces of old white bed-sheets, I fashioned a big round hollow ball over five feet in diameter. (Thanks to Armand, our property manager, for letting me use the vacant space next door to spray-paint it white and glittery.) When it was dry, I cut armholes and fitted the inside with molded padding and a strap-on nylon harness (an engineering  !). Wearing white leggings, white moon boots, and a furry white hat, I looked like the largest, friendliest snowball you ever laid eyes on! Admittedly, it wasn't perfect—the right side of the snowball was a smidge caved-in and chicken wire poked out of the bottom in a few places. But overall, I was pretty proud of my ""Adorable Snowbelle."" (Get it? A distant, sweeter-tempered cousin of the Abominable Snowman!) The new costume did a lot to bolster my sagging morale. The hitch was that it was quite heavy and severely limited my arm movement, so I decided to wear it only when standing by the highway to lure passing cars to our store.
 The plan worked! A couple Mondays ago, a minibus pulled up and deposited five mentally disabled adults at our door. Their caretaker explained that I'd waved at their bus the previous week, and the trip to Off-Season Santa was a reward for completing chores during the past week. Dad and I practically grinned ear-to-ear.
 At first, the retarded people (I refuse to call them ""retards"") seemed confused. ""It's not time for Christmas,"" one young woman said. ""Santa's supposed to be at the North Pole."" 
 Dad gave his jolliest ""ho ho ho"" and explained that Santa wanted to see what the area was like when it wasn't Christmas. (Nice save, Dad!) One man said, ""There is no Santa Claus"" repeatedly, until his caretaker took him back to the van for a much-needed time-out. After that little incident, things settled down. Each customer spent a little money on a knickknack or candy, and a couple told Dad what they wanted for Christmas. (One said he wanted a new computer—how hilarious!) Before leaving, the group posed for a photo with Dad. It's too bad we couldn't persuade them to pose for individual shots; if we had, we really would have struck pay dirt.
 Their visit perked us up, but as the afternoon wore on, tedium set in again. I changed into my Adorable Snowbelle costume and was headed out the door to scare up some business when a group of six teenagers walked in. They were all 15 or 16 and almost certainly from the nearby high school. A tall, lanky boy yelled, ""Oh my God, it's Santa!!"" and a girl pointed at my costume and shrieked with laughter. ""Welcome to Off-Season Santa, kids!"" I said, trying to be cheery, but when I turned around to look at Dad, he wasn't laughing. His face wore a grim expression.
 Well, Dad's instincts were right—it soon became clear that the kids weren't there to meet Santa, but to raise a ruckus. When they figured out that a woman in a papier-mâché snowball costume can't move very fast, the teens started running around the store, ignoring the patio-stone borders and dodging around the fragile Christmas trees in a game of catch-me-if-you-can. One of the girls said she wanted to sit on Dad's lap, but when he said that Santa's lap was only for small children, a tall boy who seemed to be the ringleader said, ""What's wrong, Santa, can't you walk?""
 At that point, Dad did something that made my jaw drop: He broke character! ""Son, I carry shrapnel in my side from serving my country,"" he yelled. (This is true. Dad was injured during basic training decades ago. As a result, the Army kept him from going overseas and assigned him a job in the motor corps at his base. But his injury has nothing to do with why he uses the Rascal; he uses one because he likes it.) Then, the boy told Dad he wanted an inflatable Jenna Jameson doll for Christmas, and Dad just about lost it. ""You need to go to confession,"" Dad said. ""Keep being a smart aleck, kid, but mark my words. In a couple years, you'll regret wasting your youth."" This speech only made the kids laugh more. It appalled me to see my dad, let alone Santa, treated like that.
 Suddenly, I felt someone tapping on my snowball shell. ""Can you feel that?"" asked the boy doing it. I hate to admit this, but I was a little scared. As I responded ""yes,"" a second boy snuck up behind me and pushed me. Then the first boy pushed me, and I found myself in the middle of an improvised game of catch! I was no longer a Snowbelle, but a  belle! By the time they were done with me, my costume looked like a deflated weather balloon covered with dirty gray handprints. 
 By now, Dad's cheeks were bright red with fury. (Interestingly, it made him look even more like Santa.) ""I tolerate no loiterers: Either buy something or get out,"" Dad yelled. ""If you don't, I'll call your school first thing in the morning."" This got the kids' attention. Of course, they took Dad at his literal word and bought ""something,"" meaning one Santa lollipop, which they tossed on the pavement outside. I tried to bend down to pick it up, but my costume was too bulky, so it laid there until we closed up the store.
 The next morning, Dad was still bitter about the teens' visit. He said he wanted a sign for our window reading, ""No One Under 18 Admitted Without A Parent Or Guardian."" I dutifully got out my trusty green and red markers and set to work on one, but in the end, I argued Dad out of the idea by saying that the sign would make us sound illicit.
 A couple days later, the teens came back. It wasn't the exact same crowd, although I did recognize a couple of them. I guess news of our store had gotten around at their school, and they were visiting out of sheer curiosity. I asked Dad if I should tell them to leave, and he said we should wait. ""Hate to say it, Jeannie, but we really need their business,"" he said. So as the kids snickered and sarcastically posed for pictures, Dad silently took his lumps. One teen made the devil-horns hand gesture behind Santa's head as I snapped the photo, but I just ignored it so as not to lose the sale. ""Didn't I tell you this place was bad?"" one of the girls told her friend, as they excitedly picked through Christmas bracelets.
 But here's the capper, Jeanketeers: Since then, Off-Season Santa has become a sort of after-school hangout.

"ATLANTA—Casually holding the drink between her index finger and thumb, a Delta Airlines flight attendant is at this moment trying to pass a cup of cranberry juice over your laptop, sources aboard the aircraft have confirmed. The plastic receptacle, which is filled nearly to the brim and rippling due to mild turbulence, is reportedly being extended across your expensive and relatively new laptop in the direction of the person seated next to you, who is currently nodding off and unaware his beverage has arrived. As the flight attendant leans in, dangling the juice above the computer containing work files and family photos you have not backed up anywhere else, witnesses are reporting that a passenger two seats behind you is trying to squeeze by both her and the beverage cart. Sources added that all of this is happening as the plane speeds at 500 miles per hour 40,000 feet above the earth. At press time, the person next to you was seen attempting to accept the drink and pass back a credit card with the same hand.

"CINCINNATI—Surprising many with his impeccable fundamentals and intense style of play, sources at the Elm Street YMCA confirmed Thursday that a 55-year-old man is absolutely dominating the competition at the gym’s evening pickup basketball game. The partially graying, tank-top–clad man—who was overheard introducing himself as “Ken” to several other players at the beginning of the game—has reportedly been utterly unstoppable on both ends of the floor, carving up the opposing team with a diverse arsenal of pump fakes, post moves, and well-timed backdoor passes. “He’s gotta be at least 15 years older than anyone else here, but he’s just blowing through people with ease,” said opposing player Evan Harris, 26, adding that the man has been confidently calling for the ball, setting screens, and directing his teammates’ positioning on defense. “He crashes the boards like a madman, he hustles down the court for fast breaks, and he sure as hell isn’t afraid to body up underneath the basket. He’s everywhere.” “And if he starts driving to the hoop, you better get out of the way,” continued Harris. “He’s a goddamn freight train.” Eyewitnesses at the recreational facility told reporters that the man, who donned a large black knee brace prior to the game, has commanded an unquestioned authority over his team as he continues racking up points, assists, steals, and rebounds. He has reportedly proven to be a formidable presence in the paint, and, in spite of his 5-foot-10, roughly 210-pound frame, exhibited a remarkably light touch on the ball while sinking several outside jump shots. Sources also confirmed that defenders have been unable to cope with the man’s dizzying array of pinpoint bounce passes from the top of the key, noting that he has also yet to commit a single turnover during the game. “He’s a little stocky, but he’s actually a lot quicker than he looks,” said 31-year-old Aaron Garrett, adding that the man has shown absolutely no signs of exhaustion or fatigue despite his shirt being completely drenched in sweat. “I tried going up for a rebound against him, and I just bounced right off his body. He’s definitely not the fastest guy out there, but he more than makes up for it with how hard he plays.” “Maybe he played in college or something,” Garrett added. “I underestimated him—I think we all did—and he’s making us pay for that now.” According to sources, the middle-aged man has been unafraid to inform teammates of their lackluster play, often imploring them to look for the open man or cut to the rim for a pass. After a breakdown in defense led to an uncontested layup for the other team, the man was observed clapping his hands together several times in frustration while shouting “Communicate!” Furthermore, several reports indicated that the 55-year-old is the only person on the court who has called fouls during the game, at one point singling out an opposing player he simply referred to as “Red Shorts” after a rough charge and sternly telling him to “cool it.” “He’s more or less a one-man team out there—everything is going through him,” said 26-year-old teammate Timothy Graham, speculating that the man must play pickup games at least twice a week to keep himself in such good shape. “I mean, Christ, we’ve been playing for a good 45 minutes, and he hasn’t even taken a single water break. I hope I’m in half as good shape as that when I’m his age.” At press time, after his team handily won the game, the 55-year-old had reportedly shaken each player’s hand, grabbed his Reebok gym bag on the sideline, and quietly walked out of the gym.

"SAN DIEGO—Touting its wide range of financially ruinous academic programs that can be tailored to meet anyone’s scheduling needs, officials at Enterprise College announced Monday that the online institution is committed to letting students amass a crippling amount of debt at their own individual pace. “Even if you work full-time and are busy raising a family, Enterprise College’s flexible courses make it easy to get back to school and take out enough student loans to completely devastate your personal finances for years to come,” said spokesperson Kerri Williams, describing how the for-profit college accommodates those who prefer to rack up their overwhelming debt a few thousand dollars at a time as well as those who would rather just plunge $30,000 into the red in two short years. “At Enterprise College, you can take as long as you need to acquire your impossible-to-shoulder burden, and with more than 180 degrees offered completely online, it’s easier than ever to slip into complete destitution from the comfort of your own home.” Williams went on to state that regardless of the rate at which students accumulate debt, the sooner they enroll, the sooner they can begin defaulting on their loans and having their wages garnished by the government.

"NEW YORK—With word spreading rapidly through office towers, apartment buildings, and across all five boroughs, sources confirmed Friday that New Yorkers were abuzz over reports that a new resident had moved to the city. Recent arrival Keith McGregor, 26, has reportedly dominated conversations from neighborhood dive bars to uptown dinner parties, with New York’s 8.4 million inhabitants exchanging excited whispers about who this newcomer is and what he might be like. “I can’t wait to find out more about this Keith guy who just moved in,” said Upper West Side doorman Patrice Hall, 53, who told reporters that while he doesn’t know much about McGregor yet, the young man’s name seems to keep popping up in just about every interaction he has with coworkers, friends, and neighbors. “I wonder how he’s adjusting to the city so far. People have been saying he moved here from a small town and doesn’t really know anyone, so if I run into him I’ll be sure to introduce myself.” “Who knows? We may even have a few things in common,” Hall added. According to sources, gossip about McGregor began to circulate last week, just moments after his rented U-Haul van was seen emerging from the Lincoln Tunnel into midtown Manhattan. News that he had already found a place to live in Bushwick and was interested in pursuing a career in graphic design spread quickly among cab drivers, shop owners, theater workers, Wall Street executives, and riders of the city’s public transit system, fueling speculation about the new resident’s tastes in music, TV, movies, and more. New Yorkers who have spotted McGregor around town have reportedly tried to point him out surreptitiously to their fellow pedestrians and parkgoers. Many said they were fascinated by his simple-but-stylish clothing choices and had engaged in spirited discussions with other New Yorkers regarding what they could glean about his personality from the way he looks and dresses. “My friend saw him reading on the subway, so I’d be curious to know if he’s into books,” said Harlem resident and Pilates instructor Kayla Green, adding that she “can’t wait” to meet McGregor in person and tell him about a couple of independent bookstores in the Village that she was confident he would “absolutely love.” “And I haven’t heard anyone mention a girlfriend, which makes me wonder if he’s single. If so, he’s in luck, because there’s a bunch of single people here for him to meet.” “A big city like this can be a little intimidating at first, but hopefully he likes it here and stays a while,” she continued. “At least, longer than Jennifer [Chan] did. She left after just six months, and I’m still kicking myself for never stopping to say hello to her.” While questions remain about McGregor’s impetus for moving to the Big Apple, local residents were in agreement that whatever the reason, they were happy—as always—to welcome a new member to the New York City community. A particular cause for enthusiasm has been a neighbor’s sighting of McGregor moving an acoustic guitar into his apartment, which has led to considerable chatter among the city’s residents, with many privately expressing excitement over how much they look forward to hearing him play. “It’s always a treat to have a new face in town,” said Brooklyn resident and recent college graduate Kai Tapplemore. “And it will be really great to have another young person like me living here. Whatever his personality or interests, I’m sure he’ll find a lot of fun things to do around town.” “If he’s not too busy, I’ll see if he wants to hang out sometime,” Tapplemore added. At press time, sources confirmed the entire population of New York was heading over to McGregor’s apartment to welcome him to the city and offer to show him around the area.

"SIOUX FALLS, SD—Following a multiple-vehicle accident on Interstate 90 that temporarily halted traffic in both directions, sources reported Friday that a motorcyclist involved in the crash was hauled off and salvaged for parts. “That motorcyclist looked like a total loss when they brought it in here, but we were surprised by how many usable parts we were able to save,” said Donald Hill, who led the salvage efforts, adding that despite extensive damage to its exterior and a pair of entirely demolished kidneys, he and his team managed to reclaim a couple decent lungs and a cornea that still worked “like a charm.” “The wreck really mangled that biker, but we might be able to fix that leaky heart valve and get some good use out of it. Unfortunately, the rest is so scraped up and damaged that all we can do is cart it out to the yard with all the other completely totaled ones.” At press time, Hill was baffled by how the motorcyclist had even managed to drive around with a liver in such bad shape.

"Hey, you haven't even touched your milk. What's the matter? Milk is an important part of a balanced diet, good for strong bones, healthy teeth, and—what do you mean ""spoiled""? Gimme that. Spoiled? This milk smells as fresh as the day I bought it. What? Listen to me, missy—this milk is expired when I say it is.
 That's final.
 Hundreds of thousands of cows are milked every day, and a whole lot of very good men and women spend hours putting that milk into cartons and driving it to the market, just so little girls like you can drink it and be healthy. After all the hard work those people and cows put into every glass, you're telling me you don't want to drink your milk? I'm disappointed in you, honey.
 Let me see that. Look, the expiration date is only six days ago. What could possibly go wrong in six days? That's not even a week. Besides, you had this with your cereal Saturday morning, and you're perfectly fine. As I remember, you had seconds. 
 Now you listen to me, young lady. That milk is not yellow—it's off-white. What difference does the color make, anyway? It's not like you have eyes on the inside of your mouth. What? Let me see. I don't smell anything. Besides, if you drink it, you won't have to smell it anymore.
 Why? Because I said.
 Do you know what an expiration date is? Numbers. That's all. It's not like you enter into a legally binding contract with the dairy industry the moment you pay for your milk. The expiration date is a suggested guideline, and guidelines aren't always made with the individual's best interest in mind. Sometimes they're just there to make Daddy pay for new milk. 
 What are you going to listen to, a mechanical stamp on a carton or your own flesh and blood? I'm your father, and as your father, I'm telling you that the milk is good.
 I did not raise you to be a follower. You're a Gordan, and a Gordan never takes an expiration date at face value. A Gordan asks the important questions, like, ""Who said?"" and ""Who benefits?"" and ""Why should I let an expiration date ruin a perfectly good glass of milk?""
 I've had it up to here with you! Give me that glass. Mmm. See? Mmmmm-mm! This is the best milk I've ever tasted, in fact. It has a slight hint of berries. Mmm-mm. You like berries, right? Try it.
 So, it's good enough for your old man, but it isn't good enough for you? Well, it's your loss. This is delicious. I'm going to have some more. Yum! You like cottage cheese, don't you? This is the same thing as cottage cheese. We'll mix in some Nesquik. You won't see the color or taste the little extra flavor that way. At least try it. Two bites?
 I'll give you ""gross.""
 Okay, fine. Pour it down the drain. Oh, and here's three dollars. Throw that down the drain right after it, because that's exactly what you're doing. It's…
 Oof. Hold on. Daddy's not feeling too good. I think Daddy needs to sit down. No honey, it's not because of the milk. It's a coincidence. 
 Come back here and… Oh, Daddy doesn't… You'll grow up to… Oh golly. Hold that thought, sweetie. Daddy will be right back… ",1,This Milk Is Expired When I Say It Is
"WASHINGTON—Noting that it had already disrupted several natural communities in Kansas and Iowa, officials from the Bureau of Consumer Protection revealed Tuesday that Bonito’s, a highly invasive strain of casual dining restaurant, had recently been spotted in parts of eastern Nebraska. “Though native to certain Mid-Atlantic states, this rapidly multiplying franchise poses a grave threat to the existing diversity of budget-friendly family dining options throughout the central United States, and if left unchecked could have a lasting, adverse impact on local fast-food chains,” said BCP spokesperson Erica Wilcox, adding that the non-native lunch and dinner establishment could be identified by its large size, bright red-and-orange brand coloring, and its distinctive Tex-Mex spin on traditional American fare. “We are working hard to contain this outbreak to the affected area around exit 451 to ensure this culinary menace does not spread any further west to vulnerable locations such as Elkhorn or the Oak View Mall. Let me be clear: With its formidable entrée selection and its Dollar Loco Menu, this fast-casual southwestern grill has the potential to overrun dozens of indigenous restaurants across the I-80 corridor.” Wilcox added that her agency might have no choice but to unleash a larger predatory franchise into the area, such as Chipotle or Panera Bread, in order to drive the invasive eatery out of the region for good.

""Me and Marc, we're like Batman and Robin,"" said Rotham, 19, who met Morrell when both were freshmen at Canton (OH) McKinley High School. ""Wherever I lead, I can count on him to follow.""

The duo's mutual sidekicksmanship often manifests itself during road trips. ""Whenever we drive down to Cincinnati to see bands, I take the wheel,"" Morrell said. ""Me being the leader, not to mention the one with the car, I'm always the one who drives."" Rotham, however, sees it differently. ""As the man with the plan, I choose to take the role of navigator on road trips,"" he said. ""Marc couldn't find his ass with a homing device, so that means I've got to man the maps. And, let's face it, even though Sulu pilots the Enterprise, he still takes orders from Kirk. I am captain, and Marc is my first lieutenant."" Though Morrell and Rotham generally enjoy having a sidekick, both acknowledged that it occasionally has its downside. ""Justin's a great guy and all, but sometimes it's tough to make my moves when he's always hanging on my sleeve,"" Morrell said. ""Like, last weekend, we were at this house party, and I was trying to chat up this cute girl Amy from my psych class, and he wouldn't leave my side for a second."" Rotham expressed similar frustration over his friend's reliance on him in social situations. ""If not for me, he'd never even talk to girls,"" Rotham said. ""He counts on me to steer the ladies his way. Usually, I'm happy to, but every now and then it'd be nice if he could make things happen on his own."" Neither Morrell nor Rotham are dating, but both expressed confidence that they have some ""hot leads."" Those who know the pair, however, have their doubts. ""Those guys are sort of cool in their own way, but mostly they're dorks,"" said Renee Callahan, a friend of the two. ""I mean, they go everywhere together, have all these retarded inside jokes, and even dress almost identically. And they definitely share a lack of success with the ladies. I don't know why they don't just admit they're in love with each other."" Morrell and Rotham concede that the affection is mutual, though not equal. ""I love Justin like a brother,"" Morrell said, ""but he definitely needs me a lot more than I need him."" ""Without me, Marc would be totally lost,"" Rotham said.

"NEW YORK—As backlash against the Miss USA pageant continues to spread following controversial anti-immigration remarks made by the contest’s owner, Donald Trump, sources confirmed this week that the overt ranking of women is somehow not a part of the ongoing nationwide outrage. Trump’s inflammatory comments have reportedly prompted NBC to drop the event from its schedule and sparked a number of debates regarding decency and propriety, none of which were said to include placing women onstage and assigning them a number corresponding to their physical appearance. Sources went on to note that lining up 50 bikini-clad women so that millions of viewers could scrutinize their bodies and make their own ratings that they could then compare to the scores of the official judges was, for some reason, completely absent in the recent controversy, which instead focused wholly on whether the spectacle should be shown on a major broadcast network.

"HALLANDALE, FL–Randy Streeter, a 32-year-old sales associate at Guitar Center, has a different anecdote for every brand of alcohol.
 ""Oh, man, Malibu. That takes me back,"" said Streeter, browsing the shelves of a liquor store while picking up a bottle of wine for a dinner party. ""At Mardi Gras one year, me and my buddy Mo got totally smashed on that stuff at Pat O'Brien's. I woke up on the floor of the hotel room the next day with a fucking 'No Parking' sign on my chest. I must've ripped it down when I was drunk, but, I swear, I had zero recollection of doing it. And Mo had this girl's number written all over his arm, like, 100 times. Stay away from that stuff, man.""
 Streeter, who said his ""hardcore drinking days are mostly behind [him],"" remains a fount of wisdom on the inebriating powers, relative merits, and after-effects of such brands as Jameson's Irish whiskey, J&B scotch, and Jose Cuervo Gold tequila.
 ""Drinking tequila is like playing with fire: It warms you up nice, but if you're not careful, you get burned,"" Streeter said. ""One night back in college, this guy Andy Nardo got so polluted on tequila shots that he thought he was Mr. Fantastic. He kept going on about how he could stretch his arms out like rubber. We had to pile on him to stop him from knocking shit down. Nardo was so sick the next day, he thought he was gonna die. Leave the Cuervo alone if you know what's good for you.""
 Continuing to browse the liquor store's shelves, Streeter noticed a bottle of Jägermeister, which inevitably reminded him of another tale.
 ""Oh, man, Jäger,"" said Streeter, shaking his head. ""Graduation week at the University of South Florida is the beer blast of all time, and the guys and I were mixing Jägermeister with vodka for the crazy, mellow drunk it gives you. They say there's opium in it–or there used to be, at least–and deer's blood. But whatever's in it, for some reason, made me act like a lion tamer. All night, I'd walk up to girls with a chair and, like, do this circus act. Of course, I don't remember any of it. I had to be told about it later while nursing the king hell hangover of all time at the graduation ceremony. Just say no to that shit, my friend.""
 Not all of Streeter's stories function as cautionary tales. Noticing a bottle of Bombay Sapphire behind the store counter, he recalled a wonderful, long-ago experience with the premium gin.
 ""Back in '91, I was working at this True Value over in Hialeah. On my very last day there, just before quitting time, the guys surprised me with this really expensive bottle of Bombay Sapphire,"" Streeter said. ""We all went in the back of the store and finished off the whole thing. Man, it was like drinking diamonds. We nearly kicked this one guy's ass for trying to mix it with orange juice. It was too good for that. I'd almost say I liked it better than the Oban scotch my girlfriend gave me for my 21st birthday, but I don't know. Bombay is a breed apart, that's for sure.""
 Streeter went on to note that Bombay Sapphire and other ""top-shelf stuff"" would never cause a hangover unless the drinker were abusing it.
 ""Hangovers, now, that's a whole other topic,"" Streeter said. ""There's a bunch of stuff you shouldn't do, like mix booze and beer. Then there are all the different cures, like spicy Mexican food and stuff. Actually, that reminds me of the time my buddy and I accidentally discovered the magic cold-calzone-and-Dr. Pepper cure after spending all night drinking at this topless bar down in Cabo.

""My family has been very supportive of my marriage to Stephen,"" said Denise, speaking to reporters while doing a crossword puzzle in the mid-sized kitchen of the couple's mid-priced home. ""They're always polite to him when we visit on holidays, so I guess they must like him well enough. They've never really said much about it, so, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not defying them in any way."" Many times, a blossoming love affair flouts conventionally held beliefs, daring to boldly violate taboos in its furious, fevered pursuit of ecstatic union. Such is not the case, however, with the Feeneys' romance. From the moment they met while working summer jobs for the same Elgin, IL, catering company in 1991, they have followed the path of sober propriety, achieving partially consuming intimacy by exercising caution and reserve, keeping a clear head at all times, and taking care to avoid rash, possibly regrettable decisions. ""When we got married, we decided to wait until I established myself as a regional assistant at Xerox before having our first child, Jessica, who is four now,"" Stephen said. ""And once we could afford the down payment on a decent house in one of the better neighborhoods, we went ahead with our second child, little Bradley. It's important to start a family relatively early if you want to be able to give your kids the benefit of your prime years."" Stephen noted that, in choosing a neighborhood, he and Denise looked closely at the quality of the local schools. He also stressed the importance of timely diphtheria vaccinations. The couple's level-headedness had been evident long before their wedding: A month after she and Stephen started dating, Denise sidestepped a potentially messy situation by quitting her community swing choir rather than pursuing a crush she had on a fellow member of the ensemble. ""I'm so glad I did the right thing,"" she said. ""Stephen has proven to be a reliable provider for our family unit. Sticking with him has proven extremely well-advised in the long run."" Responding to a reporter's question, Denise said Stephen has never serenaded her from the street below her window, waking and angering the neighbors with a loud demonstration of the depth of his eternal love for her. ""No, he's never done that,"" she said. ""He did sing to me once, though, when I asked him to help me remember how the theme from   went."" When asked if he kept any strands of Denise's hair under lock and key in a family-heirloom locket that he held close to his heart on a golden chain at all times like a precious treasure, Stephen said, ""I don't really keep anything like that lying around, no. But I do have the receipts from our first shared credit card. They're in the filing cabinet in the den. Does that count?"" ",1,Conventional Love Affair Breaks None Of The Rules
"HOUSTON— Fans of alcoholic beverages were excited by the opening of J.T. O'Drinky's, a new booze-themed bar.

"Oh, come on, guys. Did you actually think I was serious when I said all that stuff? God, that is so funny. I was totally kidding when I said I was an alcoholic. You didn't honestly believe all that stuff I said last night about ""feeling like my life was whizzing out of control,"" did you? It was a  . Haven't you ever heard of ""humor"" before?
 Yes, I realize I said, ""Please help me. I need help. Don't let me drink ever again."" But you didn't actually fall for that, did you? I was  . I say all sorts of crazy things when I've had a few too many. Remember when I said, ""Guys, we should drive up to my hometown and hang out sometime""? I didn't mean that, either. Or when I said, ""We should all chip in and buy Dan a guitar for his birthday""? I sure didn't want to do that when I woke up this morning. And all that stuff about, ""I need to enter some sort of program to get cleaned up""? Yeah, right.
 I know, I know. You think it was a cry for help. I think I remember saying something about being at the end of my rope. I might've even said I have no one else to turn to—that you are my best friends and that I can't go to my family with something like this.
 Okay, the truth is, I   need you guys… to party with me. Man, we were so hammered last night. God, that was fun. What time did we start? It was right after work, right? We went to McMurphy's Pub for a few and then to that Cuban restaurant and had that rum with dinner, and then a couple in the car on the way back to McMurphy's. What did I have, like, eight or nine drinks? More? Damn.
 Then, as I recall, we were over at Don's place, and it was at Don's that I said, ""I can't do this anymore, I just can't. I've got to stop, I'm ruining my life."" And you guys actually took me seriously? Talk about gullible. The whole time, I was thinking, ""Oooh, I'm getting these guys so good!""
 You know what a prankster I can be. You know how I sometimes fall off my chair, just to be funny, as if I'm drunk enough to fall out of my chair. And, Matt, remember that time I hit on your wife at your wedding reception? I told her that any time she gets sick of being a married woman, she could come on over to my place for a little fun on the side and no one would have to know. I knew she'd go straight to you, furious. It was all a big joke for your benefit.
 Are you still trying to talk to me about this? Can we please change the subject already? Huh? What's that? A piece of paper with my signature that says, ""I will not drink for the next month""? Yeah, like I need a signed piece of paper to stop drinking. What I need is a signed piece of paper to stop joking around all the time.
 I said I get the shakes if I don't have a drink in the morning? I really said that? And, let me guess, you fell for that one, too, hook, line, and sinker. Of course you did.
 Hey, did I tell you I got a call from that AA person this morning? That was so hilarious last night, how we got on the phone and called the national hotline, and they gave us the name of someone from the local group, and we called him up at four in the morning. Man, I love phony phone calls.
 True, I did cry. And, yes, I did go into the bathroom to talk to him, and I was in there for more than an hour, and I was sobbing. But I was crying because this guy was so unbelievably pitiful, falling for the old ""I need help"" routine.
 What? I said I'd go to the AA meeting Tuesday? Yes, Sam, I probably did ask you to please drive me there out of fear that I wouldn't have the courage to go by myself. But what you obviously didn't see is that I was totally yanking your chain.
 I don't get it. You're still not laughing. Dude, lighten up.
 You know what? I think maybe I need to find some friends who understand my sense of humor. It's been great knowing you guys all these years, but I'm beginning to see that you're just a little too uptight for my taste.

"PARIS—With talks collapsing at the 11th hour, Franco-American relations hit an all-time low Monday, casting the future of Spaghetti-Os-brand canned pasta in serious doubt. ""Thus far, three months of negotiations have yielded bitter fruit,"" French minister of foods Guy Charpentier said. ""Despite concessionary offers from both sides, no acceptable compromise has been reached on a number of key issues, including sauce tanginess, sodium levels, and pasta-ring size. As a result, the sort of friendly Franco-American partnership necessary to produce the neat, round spaghetti one can eat with a spoon may no longer be possible."" U.S. Canned Goods Secretary James Miller echoed Charpentier's sentiments with a terse, ""Uh-oh… Spaghetti-Os are in grave jeopardy."" An ambitious Franco-American joint venture, Spaghetti-Os have been a source of tension between France and the U.S. since August, when the 10-year accord governing its production expired. U.S. delegates have refused to renew the pact unless numerous revisions are made, including a 60-40 split of profits. ""We contribute a majority of the ingredients, including all of the thiamine mononitrate, ferrous sulfate, and enzyme-modified butter—not to mention all the paper for the labels—so we should get a majority of the proceeds,"" Miller said. At 11 a.m. Monday, operations at L'Usine Des Os, the world's largest Spaghetti-Os manufacturing plant, ground to a halt, leaving the world with as little as a week's supply of Spaghetti-Os in reserve. Meanwhile, French efforts to replace the O-shaped pasta with plain, easier-to-produce long spaghetti have proven fruitless, with the U.S. threatening to withhold Ravioli-Os from French supermarkets if there is an ""embarg-O."" The international dispute casts a pall over the proud and storied history of Spaghetti-Os. A symbol of trans-Atlantic friendship dating back to 1965, the canned lunchtime staple began as a cooperative effort between U.S. president Lyndon Johnson and French president Charles de Gaulle, who shared the conviction that the convenient pasta meal was a delicious and nutritious way to maintain good Franco-American relations. From 1965 to 1968, a panel of top U.S. food engineers painstakingly developed the four sizes of Os while France's most esteemed chefs developed the distinctive tomato-and-cheese sauce. Unveiling Spaghetti-Os at a White House dinner, Johnson hailed the breakthrough as ""the zesty, flavorful glue that holds our two nations together in peace."" Subsequent development of meatball and sliced-frank varieties of the product only added to its enduring mythos. After years of mutual amity, however, the Age Of Spaghetti-Os may have finally come to an end. More fuel was added to the fire earlier this month, when U.N. Secretary Of Quick-Heating Prepared Foods Stefan Fredriksen openly questioned the Franco-American venture in the November issue of  . ""In an age when Kellogg's Pop Tarts™ are being dropped on the impoverished people of Afghanistan, the notion that the U.S. and France would devote so much of their resources to the production of circular spaghetti is ludicrous,"" Fredriksen said. In a stopgap attempt to alleviate the crisis, Italian minister of cuisine Hector Boyardee offered the Franco-American alliance an emergency airlift of ""ABCs & 123s""-brand pre-cooked pasta. French officials declined the offer, however, due to their American counterparts' insistence on pronouncing ""123s"" ""one, two, threes"" rather than ""un, deux, troises."" In a recent speech to European convenience-food authorities, French President Jacques Chirac also preemptively rejected any Italian offer of pasta shaped like Spider-Man™.

"BALTIMORE—Wincing and shaking his head at the sight of trainers assisting the opposing team’s running back off the field, 34-year-old Baltimore Ravens fan Bobby Ferrara announced Sunday that “you hate to see that” while secretly feeling thrilled about the injury. “Oh man, I hope he’s okay—you never want someone to have to leave the game like that,” said Ferrara, who privately experienced a mixture of immense relief and elation over the fact that the other team’s greatest scoring threat would be immediately replaced by his rookie backup, likely forcing their offense to become one-dimensional. “He’s such a great player. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.” At press time, Ferrara’s heart had reportedly sunk as he muttered “Good to hear” upon learning the star back would be returning in time for the fourth quarter.

"ATLANTA—Savvy, experienced business traveler Donald Meyers, 46, knows a great out-of-the-way bar at O’Hare Airport’s “B” terminal that’s never crowded, the frequent flyer said Monday during a layover in Atlanta. Meyers, a project manager for Motorola who is on the road an average of 150 days a year, discovered the Windy City Pub during a three-hour layover at O’Hare in May 2001. He said the bar is one of his top 10 frequent-flying treats. “I don’t say this often, but visiting this little bar is actually worth extending your time between flights,” Meyers said. “It’s never crowded, the chairs are incredibly comfortable, and it’s set back a bit from the terminal walkways, so it’s not nearly as loud as your average airport bar. I’d have to put it up there with the Cheers bar at Detroit Metro and the one they used to have at the end of the United terminal at Denver’s old Stapleton International.”  Meyers also had high praise for Tomas Cordero, the Windy City Pub’s weekday bartender. “Tomas is great,” said Meyers, who, when not on the road, lives in St. Louis with wife Linda and their two sons Cody and Cameron. “He puts something—I don’t know what—with a little extra zing in the Bloody Mary mix. Everyone knows you shouldn’t drink before flying, but if you knew this little hidden gem, you’d probably be willing to chance it.” With an estimated 2,000 flights under his belt in his 23 years of business travel, Meyers claims to be “one of the nation’s leading authorities” on airport amenities, and said he is “more than happy” to pass along knowledge and experience to his fellow travelers. “If you don’t fly often, there’s lots of stuff you probably don’t know,” Meyers said. “Like how much better the Northwest WorldClub lounge is in Dallas than the one at most other airports—especially La Guardia. Or how you can do on-line check-in with Continental, but that’s only if you have no carry-ons. Or how you should use your Delta SkyMiles card on weekends, because you get double miles on all purchases. Those are the kind of things you may not know if you’re not a seasoned traveler like myself.” Anna Helsing, 33, sat next to Meyers on a recent St. Louis-Minneapolis flight. “I was trying to get comfortable in my seat when [Meyers] launched into this whole thing about how I should avoid those U-shaped neck pillows,” Helsing said. “When I told him I didn’t know what he was talking about, he showed me one in the SkyMall catalog and explained that they cramp your neck worse than the regular airline pillow or a folded-up blanket. I wasn’t about to use one, but he felt the need to warn me, anyway.” Catherine Appel, who sat next to Meyers on a recent San Francisco-Los Angeles flight, said he spent a majority of the trip assessing the hotels situated near various major U.S. and Canadian airports. “Apparently, the Newark Airport Westin is one of the worst in the country,” Appel said. “I have no idea if that’s true, but he seems to know. I mean, if you heard this guy talk: He advised getting the kosher meal because it’s always better. He gave me tips on getting business-class upgrades. He bragged about getting his oversized luggage onto planes as carry-on because of some weird routing loophole he knows about. And he went on and on about this magic, uncrowded bar at O’Hare, which he made sound like an oasis in the middle of the desert.” “I’d shoot myself if I ever knew that much about airport hotels and bars,” Appel added. “Thank God I don’t have to fly as much as that poor loser.”  ",1,Frequent Flyer Knows Out-Of-The-Way Airport Bar That's Never Crowded
"THE HEAVENS—Following a 8-7 victory over the Cleveland Indians that clinched the team’s first World Series title since 1908, sources confirmed Wednesday that millions of intoxicated Chicago Cubs fans are currently rioting across Heaven. Moments after watching the game’s final out from above Earth, massive throngs of intoxicated Cubs fans—most of whom went their entire lives without ever seeing the team win a World Series—poured out all over the eternal city, where they reportedly continued drinking heavily as they cheered, hugged strangers, and loudly played golden harps in celebration of their long-awaited championship. “Let’s go, Cubbies!” screamed Susan Leitch, who died of cardiac arrest in 1997 at the age of 70, before joining hundreds of fellow deceased Chicago fans as they repeatedly sang the chorus of “Go Cubs, Go!” “World Series champs! Finally!” “Woo!” continued Leitch as she drunkenly stumbled over her feet and broke out in a fit of laughter. According to reports, after one fan managed to affix a large “W” win flag to the top of the Pearly Gates, a large mob of Cubs fans began violently shaking the gateway as they chanted third baseman Kris Bryant’s name for nearly an hour. Sources confirmed that the gold-paved streets were quickly littered with empty beer cans, cigarettes, spilled food, and other refuse, while a number of inebriated fans were also seen urinating against the sapphire, emerald, and diamond–encrusted walls that protect the sacred realm. In addition to firing a slew of Roman candles upwards into infinity, a pack of belligerent fans reportedly succeeded in rocking the Throne of God back and forth until the seat of the Almighty Father tipped over onto the ground, after which several men and women began jumping up and down atop it. Many witnesses also reported seeing at least one fan hunched over and vomiting over the side of a cloud. “We did it!” shouted former Chicago resident Arnold Mathis, a victim of the 1918 flu pandemic, after climbing up the Tree of Life and bouncing on one of its branches. “I can’t believe we actually did it!” “Everybody’s getting fucked up tonight!” added Mathis. “I’ve waited my entire afterlife for this!” Some of the festivities reportedly began getting out of hand when a group of Cubs fans lit the Ladder of Divine Ascent on fire, and shortly thereafter, several teenagers dumped an entire pitcher of beer on the head of an archangel as he attempted to fly through the raucous crowds. Numerous men were later seen stripping off their shimmering Heavenly robes and streaking through God’s Kingdom. However, reports also confirmed that dozens of small children were celebrating peacefully while sitting on the shoulders of their parents or grandparents, with many wearing youth Cubs jerseys bearing the names and numbers of Ron Santo, Billy Williams, Ryne Sandberg, and Jake Arrieta. According to sources, the championship celebrations are expected to continue for much of eternity. “Cubbies! The curse is over, baby!” said longtime fan and father of three Andrew Horton, slurring most of his words as he adjusted his Cubs hat underneath his halo. “I just fuckin’ [ ], you know? Man…[ ].” “Cubbies!” Horton added. At press time, sources within Heaven confirmed that hundreds of disorderly Cubs fans had been apprehended and sent to Hell.

"Have you ever had one of those days? You know, a day when nothing seems to go right? Now, far be it from your old pal Jean to be a Gloomy Gloria who likes to saddle others with her problems, but it's unhealthy to keep things bottled up, and I just have to get the memory of this terrible day off my chest! So please bear with me as I divulge my grade-A, number-one Day From Hell!
 It all happened last Monday. (Naturally!) Before going to work, I dropped by   office to pick up my fan mail. Unfortunately, I had none. But just as I was about to leave, I felt a sharp tap on my shoulder. It was my editor, and before I could say a word, he jumped down my throat! Apparently, he hated the column I'd recently submitted to him, which was about those cute emoticon smiley-faces people put on their e-mail messages. They are just sooo precious, but try telling my grumpy editor that! He said those ""silly"" emoticons have been around for years, and that every feature columnist in America has written about them before.
 Then, Mean Mr. Editor had the nerve to say that my last few columns have been ""hackwork"" and that I was ""losing my touch,"" and ordered me to rewrite my emoticon column, or he'd permanently replace ""A Room Of Jean's Own"" with ""Cleaning Q&A."" (Geez, whatta grouch!)
 Now, that by itself would have made my day lousy enough, but brace yourself—there's more! I arrived at SouthCentral Insurance, punched in and took my seat at my workplace. All the while, I had this funny feeling. Do you ever sense that someone is watching you? Or, more to the point,  at you? I get that feeling a lot. But this time, I felt the evil eye from practically every co-worker! Then, it dawned on me.
 We have this weekly thing at work called ""Blue Monday,"" where we all take turns bringing in treats. (It's called ""Blue Monday"" because, of course, who doesn't feel blue on a Monday?) Everyone in the office looks forward to it so much, woe befall the poor sap who manages to forget to bring in something when it's her turn! Well, Jeanketeers, guess who that poor sap was this time!
 Boy, talk about getting the cold shoulder. Only in my case, it was more like the cold shoulder, back, neck, head and everything else! I mean, what was this, National Be Mean To Jean Day? First my editor, now my whole office! Boy, I couldn't wait to leave work that day.
 But believe it or not, part three of my lousy day was still to come!
 After work, I needed to go to the Pamida to pick up a few items. As I walked into the store, I noticed a sign advertising a big discount on women's cotton panties. Ever the bargain hunter, I made a beeline to the intimates department and started searching for my size. Unfortunately, the only panties I could find in my size were these sleazy-looking purple ones with red hearts all over them. (I can only imagine what hubby Rick would say about those!)
 I couldn't find a clerk on the floor, so I went up to the service counter. The moment I laid eyes on the girl working there, I should have smelled trouble. She was one of those surly, stuck-up teenage girls who thinks that just because she's thin and pretty, she can get away with anything. She was sitting there reading a fashion magazine, and even though I was standing right in front of her, she pretended not to notice me. Finally, she looked up at me, but didn't say a word. Not a single, ""May I help you?"" or anything.
 I asked her if the women's panties for sale on the racks were the only ones available, or did they have extra sizes and colors in the storeroom. For a few seconds, she just looked at me without saying anything. Then she asked for my size.
 ""Oh, does that mean you do have extra ones in back?"" I asked.
 ""I don't know,"" she answered. ""What's your size?""
 Now, this is hardly the type of thing you want to tell a snotty girl like her. I should have just dropped the matter right there, but like a dope, I told her: XXL Queen. ""Do you have any?"" I asked.
 The girl audibly snorted. ""I hope not,"" she said.
 I heard some snickers behind me. I turned around and saw a pair of cashiers not exactly concealing the fact that they found our little exchange very amusing. So I said that this is not the type of service I've come to expect from Pamida. Smirking, the girl replied, ""And what type of service do you expect?""
 Boy, was I steamed! I gave the girl a dirty look, stormed to the customer comment box, and grabbed a card. I was really going to give them a piece of my mind. But to my chagrin, the pen hanging next to the box had run out of ink, and I didn't have a pen in my purse. Going back to the service counter and asking for a pen would have been too embarrassing after all that had happened, so I just left.
 You know, I admit that old Jean is not always the brightest bulb on the tree. I screw up at work a lot, I spend a lot of money on things I don't need and, let's face it, I could stand to lose a little weight. (When they coined the phrase ""Nobody's perfect,"" they probably had me in mind!) But I've always prided myself on my easygoing nature and my humorous outlook on life. It's gotten me through some tough times.
 But sometimes, even the most easygoing person snaps.
 When I got home from the Pamida, I was so enraged from the day's events, I marched straight into the kitchen and grabbed a steak knife. Then I headed for the bedroom, where I began to repeatedly and methodically stab my plush Snoopy doll until it was an unrecognizable mass of synthetic fiber content. But I wasn't through yet. I picked up the miniature rocking chair I'd been saving in case hubby Rick and I ever had a baby and threw it against the wall, smashing it and leaving a pretty nasty dent in the plaster, to boot.
 You should have seen hubby Rick's face when he got home. But he didn't get mad at me. In fact, he looked a little awestruck.
 ""Whoa, Jean,"" Rick said. ""You finally did it. You snapped. I was starting to think you might never get around to it, but you've finally cracked up.""
 Well, for once in my life, I didn't have a clever retort. Instead, I just sat there and kept reading my  . And you know what? It felt good to say nothing!
 I mean, we're all allowed to go a little bonkers every now and then, right?

The parade, which commenced at Wynkoop Street in downtown Denver and is scheduled to culminate at the 14,440-foot-high summit of Mount Elbert, reportedly attempted to traverse a perilous route along jagged and snow-covered mountain terrain, facing blizzard-like conditions and temperatures that dropped as low as 40 degrees below freezing. “Super Bowl champs, baby!” linebacker and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller screamed from an open-top bus at the head of the parade, his teeth chattering uncontrollably as he wiped frost rapidly accumulating around his nose and mouth. “Broncos nation!” “We shocked the world!” Miller continued as he huddled with several teammates for warmth. “We’re number one!” The rally officially began at noon, with a 15-vehicle motorcade of Broncos-themed parade floats, flatbed trucks, and convertible sports cars only stopping briefly to refill supplies at a base camp in the Rocky Mountains’ Front Range. “I loved watching this team all season, and I never had any doubt that we would beat Carolina,” said 54-year-old Colorado Springs resident Nick Kirrane, one of an estimated 200,000 Broncos fans who attempted the dangerous climb to greet the Super Bowl 50 champions. “There’s no way I wasn’t going to be here today. I took the day off work, grabbed my climbing harness and ice ax, and started my 14-hour ascent so I could camp out and get a good view of the players.” According to reports, players and coaches jubilantly waved Broncos towels and danced to music playing through speakers affixed to parade floats, though the songs became difficult to hear through 60-mile-per-hour winds, and occasional bursts of blue-and-orange confetti were virtually impossible to see due to poor visibility created by ground-level fog. Sources also confirmed that a large marching band and two dozen Broncos cheerleaders accompanied the motorcade on foot, delaying the progress of the parade significantly as they slowly trudged through roughly five feet of snow. Members of the team—many of whom were accompanied by their severely frostbitten wives and small children—reportedly took turns triumphantly hoisting the Lombardi Trophy into the air, however several players were unable to maintain their grip after losing the feeling in their fingers. “Every one of these guys worked his tail off all year, and I can’t tell you how proud I am of this football team,” said Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak, who wrapped himself in numerous “Super Bowl 50 Champions” flags in an effort to keep his body temperature up and stave off the effects of hypothermia. “With the talent and the desire on this squad, there’s no reason we can’t win back-to-back championships. The goal—once we cross that nine-foot crevasse in the ice and safely get down the mountain—is to do it again next season.” “Honestly, though, winning the Super Bowl still feels pretty surreal,” added Kubiak. “I don’t think it really sunk in for me until I held up the Lombardi Trophy at the top of Pikes Peak.” As the parade continued, conditions on the ground were said to have worsened considerably, with temperatures plummeting and air growing thinner as the Broncos reached 13,000 feet of elevation. At 3:36 p.m., sources confirmed that a large avalanche hit Mount Lincoln, cutting off the Broncos’ original parade route and leaving the Super Bowl 50 champions with no choice but to take an alternate path via a steep, narrow ridge along the mountainside. The situation was reported to have grown even more serious once offensive coordinator Rick Dennison realized that the team had depleted their supply of oxygen tanks. “We have to reach the campsite before sundown, otherwise we won’t last through the night,” said Broncos quarterback and two-time Super Bowl champion Peyton Manning, rocking back and forth in the fetal position as he violently shivered. “We have to keep moving. We only have three, maybe four more hours of daylight left. Please, God, see us through this.” “How ’bout them Broncos!” added Manning, his eyes slowly rolling back in his head. “How ’bout them…Broncos….” At press time, Broncos general manager John Elway sadly confirmed that the team was forced to leave the body of Aqib Talib in the mountains after the 29-year-old cornerback froze to death.

"ANN ARBOR, MI—Saying that he had hardly noticed the time go by while receiving the series of electrically induced seizures, University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh was reportedly disappointed Friday upon learning that his electroshock therapy session was over so soon. “Oh, is our time up already?” Harbaugh was overheard saying as doctors carefully removed electrodes from his forehead that were used to deliver dozens of 450-volt shocks over the course of his 45-minute session. “These sessions are my favorite part of the week, but they always seem to go by so quickly. Well, I’m looking forward to picking this up where we left off when I come back next time.” Harbaugh added that he considered the moment during the session when he began uncontrollably vomiting to be a “real breakthrough” in his treatment.

"TORRANCE, CA—Denny Marzano, a 28-year-old Torrance man, was arrested Monday for engaging in the type of behavior found in romantic comedies.
 Marzano was taken into custody after violating a restraining order filed against him by Kellie Hamilton, 25, an attractive, unmarried kindergarten teacher who is new to the L.A. area. According to Hamilton, Marzano has stalked her for the past two months, spying on her, tapping her phone, serenading her with The Carpenters' ""Close To You"" at her place of employment, and tricking her into boarding Caribbean-bound jets.
 Hamilton made the call to police at approximately 7:30 p.m., when she discovered that the bearded cable repairman she had let into her apartment was actually Marzano in disguise.
 ""Thank God he's in custody, and this nightmarish ordeal is finally over,"" said Hamilton, a single mother struggling to raise an adorable, towheaded boy all alone in the big city. ""I repeatedly told him I wasn't interested, but he just kept resorting to crazier and crazier schemes to make me fall in love with him.""
 Marzano, who broke his leg last week falling off a ladder leaning against Hamilton's second-story bedroom window, said he was ""extremely surprised"" that his plan to woo Hamilton had failed.
 ""She was supposed to hate me at first but gradually be won over by my incredible persistence, telling me that no one has ever gone to such wild lengths to win her love,"" Marzano said. ""But for some reason, her irritation never turned to affection.""
 In addition to the stalking charges, Marzano is accused of framing Stuart Polian, a handsome Pasadena attorney and chief competitor for Hamilton's hand, for arson. Marzano denied the charge.
 ""While it is true that I would love to have seen my main romantic rival out of the picture, I did not burn down that animal shelter and try to pin it on Mr. Polian,"" Marzano said. ""I believe and have always believed I can win Kellie's love without resorting to such illegalities.""
 Marzano had been arrested for engaging in romantic-comedy behavior on five previous occasions. The most recent arrest came in May 1998, when he pretended to be a confession-booth priest in the hopes of manipulating a Fresno, CA, woman into unwittingly revealing her love for him.

"If America is to have any hope of one day becoming a true democracy, its populace must be better informed. And if this is to happen, the media must do their part by providing citizens with a more balanced, carefully considered view of the issues.
 It is a misguided notion that the populace is too busy watching football and soap operas to care about matters of true import, or that the apparent complacency of the citizenry stems from simple apathy. Many Americans read newspapers. And most of these readers are interested in the front page, as well as the sports page. But a complex web of corporate interests, along with a trend toward fewer companies owning more communications holdings, contributes to a narrowing of views expressed in the papers of record. If GE owns NBC, and GE stands to make a huge profit from the sale of war machines, can we count on unbiased coverage of a U.S. war from NBC? Of course not. But it is just such unbiased coverage that we desperately need if we as citizens are to enjoy a true democracy.
 Those who trumpet the supremacy of democracy forget that it is merely one of many systems that govern the decisions affecting our lives. Capitalism, our economic system, exerts an equally profound influence, perhaps greater. What stricter, more hierarchical system exists than the modern corporation? No medieval fiefdom of serfs and lords could match the modern corporation in its rigorous control of the populace. And though the people sometimes stay quiet, the corporations never do. They hire lobbyists, fresh from government service, to find the ears of policymakers.
 To counter the overbearing influence of corporations, the populace must engage in a vigilant fight with itself to remain educated and vocal. But they cannot do it alone: The media bear a heavy responsibility to make the interests of the people—not parent companies such as GE—their priority when making decisions regarding coverage.
 An unenlightened democracy, ignored by an ill-informed populace grazing blindly in corporate pastures, is a democracy in name only. Move over, Shania, country's got a new queen.
 Make that three.
 Their names are Emily Erwin, Natalie Maines and Martie Seidel, but to millions of rabidly devoted fans across America, they're the blonde and bodacious trio known as the Dixie Chicks. Tearing it in up in three-part harmony with their own special, no-holds-barred brand of country, the sexy Chicks just might be Nashville's answer to The Spice Girls. But unlike the British bod squad, the Dixie Chicks are definitely still flying high.
 What? You say you haven't caught Dixie Chicks fever yet? Well, you're in rapidly dwindling company. Because with seven million copies of their debut album   sold to date, the Chicks are hotter than Natalie's granddaddy's famous barbecued ribs. What's more, the Chicks' first three singles off  all quickly soared into the country Top 10, earning them the distinction of best-selling country group of 1998.
 Not bad for a group that played its first show on a Dallas street corner for spare change.
 Even music lovers who've never followed the country scene are lining up to catch the sultry Texas trio in concert. Not your average Southern set, this sass-spiked, tradition-busting threesome has tossed aside the usual country rhinestones and is wowing crowds across America with a sleek and sophisticated style that's all glitz—and all Chicks.
 But lest you think the Chicks are just a bunch of pretty faces, rest assured: These gals sound every bit as good as they look. The strong vocal stylings of Maines, front and center on such platinum chart-toppers as ""I Can Love You Better"" and ""There's Your Trouble"" are electrifying when paired with the spirited performances of Erwin and Seidel on fiddle, guitar, mandolin, dobro—even banjo. Longtime D.C. fans and new converts alike can't help but be swept away by the group's unique blend of country, honky-tonk, blues and folk.
 It's been nearly 10 years since its debut on that street corner in Dallas, but America's newest country sensation is still going strong, consistently delivering hits packed with sweetness and attitude. And with two CMA Awards—Group Of The Year and the Horizon Award for best new country talent—already under their collective belt, one thing's for sure: The Dixie Chicks won't be playing for spare change again anytime soon.

"BENTON, NE—They say adversity brings people closer together. They say hardship only strengthens the ties that bind. On April 2, the people of Benton, a tiny farming community of 1,200 in the northwest corner of Nebraska, got the opportunity to find out for themselves. That was the fateful day it was discovered that Nancy Kimble, the new gym teacher at Benton Junior High School, is a lesbian. The crisis easily could have torn the town apart. But instead, it only made the people of Benton stronger, serving as a precious reminder of what truly matters. ""My first reaction was, 'A lesbian gym teacher? How could this happen here? Maybe somewhere else, but not in Benton,'"" said Georgia Ellison, a lifelong resident of the town. ""I was devastated. But everyone has been so unbelievably supportive of each other throughout this whole ordeal. In hard times like these, you really find out who your friends are."" Carolyn Marchand, whose daughter Stephanie is in Kimble's sixth-period class, reacted to the news with shock and fear. But even before she could grab her keys and race to school to pick up Stephanie, there was a knock at the door. Leslie North, a neighbor she barely knew, was standing on her porch. ""Leslie said she was just as shaken as I was, and told me that if there was anything at all she could do to help, I shouldn't hesitate to ask,"" Marchand said. ""Then I invited her in, and we had apple pie and just talked for a few hours. It was then that I knew we were going to be all right."" Added Marchand: ""Thank God we found out before the swimming unit started."" The crisis began at approximately 10:15 a.m. on April 2, when, before an entire second-period gym class, seventh-grader Jodi Woodring asked Kimble if she was gay. Kimble replied yes, and within an hour, word of the lesbian presence had spread throughout Benton. The school's switchboards were swamped with calls, the city council called an emergency meeting, and the mayor made an impassioned plea for calm, imploring parents to remove their children from school in ""as orderly a manner as possible."" But amid the chaos and pain were countless moments of human kindness, of selfless individuals placing the well-being of their fellow Bentonians ahead of their own. Jeff and Irene McArdle, whose sixth-grade daughter Annie had suffered exposure to lesbianism, were moved by the outpouring of support they felt from the community. ""Our neighbors, the Slumans, have three children who were in [Kimble's] class, so they certainly had their own troubles,"" Irene said. ""But when they found out that our Annie had tried out for the volleyball team, which was coached by Kimble, they sent us a bouquet of flowers and a note saying they were glad Annie didn't make the team and was safe again. Knowing people care really helps you get through something terrible like this."" Bob Watters, whose daughter Shannon took gym under the safe tutelage of the aggressively heterosexual Mr. Voorhees, said everyone in the community has a responsibility to do his or her part. ""Our family, thank God, was spared,"" Watters said. ""But we know it easily could have been us instead of the Piatkowskis or the Ryans or the Bettencourts. That's why we all need to do everything we can for each other—especially for the children—during this dark time."" The people of Benton know that only through love, understanding and compassion will they put this painful episode behind them. And slowly but surely, they are beginning to do just that.

"Having nearly been shot to pieces by an impudent member of the yeoman class, Standish and I fled in terror across the valley. I ask you, what-ever happened to the milk of human kindness? Strip a man of his fortune and status, and suddenly he is a marked man, the target of antipathy of every shape and stripe!
 What I wouldn't have given to be back on the Zweibel Estate in my cozy death-bed, squatting over my jewel-encrusted bed-pan. Instead, I was forced to fend for my-self in the wild against rabid bob-cats and carnivorous trees.
 By night-fall, Standish and I had finally managed to retreat to the wooded ridge. It was sad to look at Standish, who was but a hollow semblance of his former self. His once-immaculate livery was stained with dirt and covered with brambles and nettles. I saw my own reflection in a small puddle of water and could not believe how ghastly I looked. I'm 132 years old, but I looked more like 146!
 I had finally come to the end. All in all, it had been a nice life. I had been the publisher of the Republic's finest news-paper; how many can claim that? I also had my own private slaughter-house and a giant oil portrait of Kaiser Wilhelm. And I once kissed Sophie Tucker square on the lips. But now, it was all over. ""Let us go to the top of the ridge,"" I told Standish, ""and cast ourselves off. The world no longer needs T. Herman Zweibel, nor his man-servant.""
 We started up the ridge, but as we progressed, the woods grew thicker and darker. The moon disappeared, and we realized we had taken a wrong turn. We were about to reverse our steps, when we noticed, directly ahead of us, a flaming torch. Approaching the torch, we found that its light revealed a well-trodden path. We followed the path and discovered a long row of evenly spaced torches beside it. ""This must lead to some kind of camp, Standish,"" I said. ""Proceed with caution. A posse could be lying in wait for us.""
 The sound of music and laughter grew louder. Eventually, we came upon a clearing and ducked behind a bush to conceal our-selves. Nothing could have prepared us for what we saw in that clearing.

"NEW ORLEANS—In a stunning revelation, doctors announced at a press conference Thursday that mandatory Super Bowl blood testing proved that head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh do not share the same father. “The Paternity Index from our DNA profiling analysis shows conclusive evidence that Jack Harbaugh is John’s father, but Jim is in fact the product of a relationship between his mother and another man,” said Dr. Gabriel Hosea, adding that the identity of the man in question “will not be made public at this current juncture.” “I have already informed the Harbaughs, and while this was obviously shocking news to members of their family, we simply ask that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.” At press time, sources within the 49ers organization confirmed that Jim Harbaugh had just left New Orleans to seek out his real father.

"NEW ORLEANS—Tied up with their efforts to crack their most intriguing case yet, sources confirmed Sunday that the Harbaugh Boys missed the first half of Super Bowl XLVII while attempting to solve The Mystery of Smugglers Cove. According to sources, the amateur sleuths and head football coaches—Jim, the younger, brown-haired, and more fiery and brash of the two, and John, the older, brown-haired brother, who is also fiery and brash—failed to make kickoff for the championship matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens while investigating the mysterious circumstances surrounding the theft of a cache of priceless gems, just the latest case taken on by the prodigious detective duo. “In between finding the jewels, stopping that ring of diamond smugglers, and our unexpected excursion to Parrot Island, we completely forgot about the big game!” Jim Harbaugh told reporters, untangling his headset and tugging his windbreaker over his shoulders before rushing into the 49ers’ locker room. “Luckily, Old Man Hobson didn’t mind giving us a ride back to the Superdome in his seaplane. That’s two favors we owe him now.” The Harbaugh Boys have reportedly wowed football fans and law enforcement alike with their impressive feats both on and off the field. In their latest exploit, the pair reportedly worked together to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of valuable gemstones loaned out to the New Orleans Natural History Museum by the Countess Grafton. Sources confirmed that the case led the brothers through a labyrinthine adventure featuring hidden passageways, a steamy bayou filled with deadly crocodiles, and a mysterious blonde-haired man in a trench coat—all while enduring the hype and public relations challenges posed by Super Bowl media week. “Both of us were real busy getting our squads ready for the Super Bowl, but once we got word that the museum had been robbed just days after a glass-bottomed boat went missing off the shores of Smugglers Cove, we knew something was a little too perfect about this perfect heist,” said John Harbaugh, who according to sources is considered to be the more logical and rational of the two brothers by a negligible margin. “And since we knew the police weren’t going to figure out this one on their own, we realized we had to get to work.” “In the end, it turned out that old widow wasn’t as innocent as she wanted us to believe,” the Ravens coach added. According to sources, the Harbaugh Boys have over the years tackled dozens of cases, including The Secret of Skull Mountain and The Disappearing Floor, often with the assistance of their doughy friend and sidekick, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Though the sibling detectives have successfully solved every single whodunit they have taken on—all while maintaining an impressive 89-38-1 coaching record between them—the boys’ father, Jack Harbaugh, a former college football coach and renowned private investigator, isn’t always so enthusiastic about his sons’ interest in his line of work. “Frankly, I wish they would stay out of this business. They’re good detectives, but they should focus on their playbooks and leave the gumshoe bit to the professionals,” the elder Harbaugh said. “And a lot of the time, it seems they spend more time screaming at each other than they do actually solving cases.”  At press time, sources said the Harbaugh Boys had again become distracted from their head coaching duties upon taking on The Mystery of The Missing Run Defense.

"NEW YORK—After noting the respectable performance of Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and the excellent record of San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh, the National Football League announced Tuesday it is actively seeking any and all Harbaughs currently not in use. “If we could find maybe three or four more Harbaughs, we could replace at least one of the Whisenhunts, Turners, and Sparanos we’re making do with now,” a statement from the league read in part. “The NFL is prepared to offer a hefty finder’s fee to anyone able to locate adult male Harbaughs of decent condition who can speak English and identify a regulation football.” NFL sources said the only person to answer the inquiry, an Africa-American male who became agitated when asked to produce proof of his Harbaughness, was almost certainly former Minnesota Vikings coach Denny Green in disguise.

"JERUSALEM—In a surprise announcement with far-reaching theological implications, Jesus Christ The Nazarene, founder of Christianity and spiritual leader of nearly two billion people, revealed Monday that He has converted to ""the one true religion"" of Islam.
 The controversial announcement has sent shockwaves through religious circles around the globe.
 ""Allah is the name of the One and Only God,"" Christ said. ""Allah has 99 beautiful names: He is known as The Gracious, The Merciful, The Beneficent, The Creator, The All-Knowing, The All-Wise, The Lord Of The Universe, The First, The Last and many more. He has revealed Himself unto Me through the holy words of the blessed Qur'an, and I have put My trust and faith in Him.""
 As part of His conversion, Christ said He has taken a new name, Isa Ibn Maryam al-Salaam Christ Shabazz.
 Christ, 33, is urging Christians worldwide to renounce His former religion of Christianity and join Him in embracing the Muslim way of life.
 ""People of all nations, in the past, you have heard Me say that whosoever shall believe in Me shall not die, but have eternal life,"" Christ said. ""But now, I say unto you, forget I ever said that. There is only one holy revelation of Allah, the Qur'an, which was dictated to the Prophet Mohammed, Praise Be Unto Him, by the Archangel Jibreel in the seventh century after I died.""
 According to Christ, the beauty and perfection of the Qur'an's Surahs are without equal in all creation, encompassing and surpassing both the Judaic Torah and the New Testament Gospels of His apostles. The former Christian messiah went on to cite Surah  , which reads, ""This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.""
 ""What could be more clear?"" Christ said.
 ""I was wrong, and I know that now,"" He added. ""I deeply regret any problems or confusion I may have caused.""
 The controversial retraction of two millennia of Christian doctrine has provoked strongly divided reaction. Millions of devout Christians, insisting that obeisance to Christ's commands is the cornerstone of their faith, have heeded His instructions and converted to Islam. Millions more, however, have decried the recalcitrant Christ's apostasy, breaking ties with Him and calling His conversion ""a heathen act"" of ""utmost blasphemy before Himself.""  ""Jesus, or Isa Shabazz, or whatever He's calling Himself these days, is the way, the truth and the light. It says so in the Bible,"" said devout Catholic Kathleen Langan of Cork, Ireland, kneeling toward Mecca for the first time. ""My loyalty to Him is absolute. If He told me to be a Buddhist, I'd do it. All praise and thanks to Allah.""
 Ruth-Anne Girolamo, a Sunday school teacher in Stillwater, OK, disagreed. ""I've been a Bible-believing Christian all my life, and nothing, not even a direct order from Christ Himself, is going to change that,"" Girolamo said. ""If Christ is going to leave the fold and become a sinner, we'll just have to go on worshipping Him against His will.""
 The Roman Catholic Church is just as divided: Approximately half the members of the Vatican's College of Cardinals have advocated embracing Islamic law, while the other half is calling for Christ's immediate excommunication and recommending the interim worship of Pope John Paul II until a suitable replacement deity can be found.
 In perhaps the oddest development, the Jews For Jesus organization announced Monday that it has split into three separate groups: Jews Still For Jesus, Jews For Allah, and Jews For Just Being Jews Again.
 Christ said He arrived at the decision to convert after centuries of deep soul-searching and contemplation. But it was not until last week's Good Friday holiday, He said, that His true spiritual path became clear.
 ""I was in church, watching all these people hold a candlelight vigil on the day of My crucifixion, when I suddenly felt a profound sense of emptiness,"" Christ said. ""I got up and walked out, and just sort of wandered aimlessly for a while, wondering what it all meant. Then, I saw something I'd never noticed before. At the mosque down the street, supplicants were gathering to celebrate their weekly holy day of worship, which, by sheer coincidence, happens to be Friday.""
 ""I walked in nervously, unsure of why I was even there. After all, during the Crusades, My followers had slaughtered thousands of these people in My name, and I thought maybe they wouldn't accept Me,"" Christ said. ""But as I listened to the Imam deliver the weekly sermon, or  , I felt the power of Allah in My heart. For the first time, I knew I'd found true inner peace.""
 ""I now know it wasn't random chance that brought Me to that mosque,"" Christ continued. ""It was the will of Allah.""
 When asked about His future plans, Christ said His next move will be to undertake the  , the holy pilgrimage to Mecca all Muslims are required to make at least once in a lifetime. After that, Christ said He hopes to take a few months off to rest and meditate before starting the next phase of His ministry: traveling to churches around the world and imploring the Christian faithful to stop believing in Him.
 ""My new spiritual advisor, the Righteous Hassan Abdul al-Aziz, has explained to Me that I am not—nor was I ever—actually the Son of God, but merely one of many Prophets of the divine revelation which was to come after Me,"" Christ said. ""After all, there is only one God, so any belief in a triune god, or 'trinity,' is polytheistic and contradicts the word of Allah Himself.""
 ""For it is written, in Surah  , 'And behold, Allah will say—O Jesus Son of Mary, did you say to men, worship me and my mother as gods beside Allah? He will reply—Glory to you, I could never say what I had no right [to say].'"" Christ said. ""You see? It turns out, worshipping Me isn't the key to the Gates of Heaven, after all. Salvation can only be found in the Five Pillars of Shahada, Salat, Saum, Zakat and Hajj. I can't believe how obvious it all seems to Me now.""

"LOS ANGELES—Responding to the explosive growth of the U.S. prison population, WB executives announced Monday that the network will soon launch a new sitcom targeting the nation's approximately 1.8 million incarcerated TV viewers.
 ""America is fast becoming the most jailed nation on Earth, with prisons packed to capacity and a swamped, inefficient judicial system that is ill-equipped to keep pace with the ever-growing crime rate. Clearly, something had to be done,"" said WB vice-president of programming Grant Bachman. ""And what better way to address this serious crisis than with the outrageous new comedy  , debuting this week as part of the WB's 'Lock-Down Thursdays'?""
 ""U.S. prisoners,"" Bachman added, ""represent a powerful demographic that this nation's entertainment industry can no longer afford to ignore.""
 Described in WB promotional literature as ""a hysterical look at the nutty goings-on in a typical American maximum-security federal correctional facility,""   will give the nation's nearly two million convicts the chance to ""follow the weekly adventures of a zany bunch of hardened killers, drug offenders, B&E men and wacky, psychotic rapos"" just like themselves.
 ""It's basically a show about living and learning in the '90s in prison,"" Bachman said.
 Advance advertising figures for the show are said to be ""very promising,"" with several high-profile accounts already secured and airtime pre-sold for most of the show's initial six-week run.
 ""U.S. inmates spend more than $5 billion in cigarettes each year, using them to buy everything from toilet paper and de-lousing shampoo to playing cards and dice,"" said Bryce Kelso of  . ""They're a prime, untapped consumer market that any smart advertiser would want to reach. The fact is, every day this vast market continues to go untargeted is millions more dollars in lost revenue. That's a harsh economic reality, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. It must be faced.""
 Added Kelso: ""Do you realize that the average rapist is out on the street and in stores in just five years?""
 The first six episodes of  , WB officials said, have been extensively focus-grouped on a wide variety of felons at some 70 maximum-security facilities across the U.S. The show has reportedly scored high among all major prison demographics, from armed robbers to child molesters.
 Particularly popular among focus groups was the debut episode, in which main character Detroit Ray, sentenced to life without parole for the murder of his wise-cracking landlord, finds himself desperately trying to fend off impending group anal-rape in the prison shower.
 ""It's great, over-the-top physical comedy,"" WB president Dan Vittolo said. ""And it really seemed to hit test audiences where they live.""
 Future plotlines include a side-splitting mix-up when Ray's buddy Jorge pretends to be his ""bitch"" to impress a visiting cellmate; Ray slashing the wrong guard ""just because he's too proud to admit he can't see without glasses""; and a full-blown prison riot ""gone totally haywire.""
 ""I thought there was going to be a riot right there in the screening room after that one,"" Vittolo joked.
 ""We feel confident that we can provide the swollen, overcrowded ranks of the U.S. prison system with characters and situations they can truly relate to,"" said Miles Forrest, recent Harvard graduate and   head writer. ""The difficulty of sneaking a spoon out of the cafeteria to sharpen on a concrete floor; the silly shenanigans that ensue when someone smuggles in heroin inside their rectum; the overworked, underpaid guards and their nutty, sadistic foibles; and the goofy rivalries between warring, tattooed prison gangs—whatever's funny.""
 What's more,   executive producer Ira Clausner said, the audience for such prison-themed fare will only grow in the coming years.
 ""The U.S. prison population has doubled in the past 12 years and will probably do so again over the next 12,"" he said. ""With that kind of grim reality working in our favor, we can't lose. Numbers don't lie, and these alarming figures, the result of years of social neglect and public apathy, paint a very bright picture for the future of the WB.""
 Vittolo agreed. ""The number of U.S. inmates now stands at an all-time high,"" he said. ""We'd be fools to just stand around and watch things get worse without lifting a finger to capitalize on the situation."" ",1,WB Targets Booming U.S. Prison Population With New Sitcom

"NEW YORK—Grateful to interview anyone but the two head coach brothers, members of the sports media expressed on Wednesday their unanimous, unequivocal relief that they didn’t have to put up with those goddamn Harbaughs while covering this year’s Super Bowl. “Thank fucking Christ,” said NESN reporter Doug Kyed, adding that he “just could not handle” sitting through any more terse, hostile press conferences with that asshole Jim or pretending to care that John was always the supportive brother. “Compared to that god-awful Harbaugh shit, John Fox is nothing—he just shuts up and lets Peyton Manning go. Hell, even Carroll’s fine. Give me Pete Carroll any day of the week if it means I never have to talk to another fucking Harbaugh again.” Media personnel were reportedly further relieved after realizing they wouldn’t have to watch Joe Flacco take a single snap on Sunday.

It was just about getting outside with friends and running up and down the sidelines until it was too dark to see the clipboard.” Reached for comment, Jack Harbaugh told reporters that regardless of which team wins the Lombardi Trophy, he is simply proud that his sons never lost the childlike petulance they always had as young coaches.

"MANHATTAN, NY—Nestled in the southeast corner of New York State, Manhattan is an old-fashioned sort of community, the kind of place where people still live in close proximity to one another and walk to the corner store to pick up the daily paper. So when the people of this close-knit burg on the Hudson River found out that two of their own, Abe and Myra Saunders, were divorcing after 23 years of marriage, disbelief was the prevailing response. ""I was stunned when I heard that somebody in our town was getting divorced,"" said David Cutler, 37, who said he doesn't know the Saunderses but lives just six blocks from their apartment on 77th Street.

"So, you're all going out tonight after work for a few drinks at the bar down the street? Well, thanks for the invite, but no, thanks. Fraternization with coworkers may be fun, but let me make one thing clear: I'm not one of those people who goes around having fun. I know you people like to gather around Laura's work station and joke about the sign on the copy machine or the socks the FedEx man wears. I'm sure it's really enjoyable. I'm sure you all have a good time. As for me, I just can't relate to the way people attempt to enrich their lives with social interaction. I, for one, have better things to do with my time. You know, like the work we get paid to do? While you're all chattering away, filling each other's heads with office gossip, I'm using my time constructively. I'm not running around, shooting my mouth off, telling jokes, and schmoozing. There are files to be filed, papers to be sorted, proposals to be written. Idle hands are the devil's tools, and I'm certainly not going to let them lead me down the road to delighting myself. I notice you all seem to get a kick out of Larry's antics. That's fine for Larry, I guess. But you won't see me running around, saying ""Everyone, pay attention to me! I am not a robot! I have a need to interact with others."" No, I will be in my office, in my chair, with both of my feet on the floor under my desk. Why spend time frivolously when there are tasks and problems in the world? If everyone thought that having fun was a worthwhile endeavor, nothing of import would ever be accomplished. Everyone would be playing games or appreciating music or reading glossy four-color magazines. Meanwhile, the whole world would fall apart. Well, I won't be party to the downfall of mankind through wanton acts of indiscreet enjoyment. My time is too valuable to be spent indulging in lighthearted activities that ""increase the quality of my life."" Life is meant for living meticulously, not for the trifles of gratifying amusement. So, no, I don't care to sign the card for Sheila. Have you ever seen me goof off? No, you haven't. I don't go for that namby-pamby personal happiness.

You may have a need to form relationships with other humans, and participate in the community at large, but I am well above such trivialities. It's just not my style to engage others in a mutually enjoyable interchange of thoughts or ideas. I know my words are falling on deaf ears. I don't expect to change any minds with my little speech here. I just want to give you something to ponder tonight as you're out there indulging in senseless, non-constructive recreation. Perhaps someday you'll see the wisdom of what I'm saying. As for now, just go on without me and have your ""fun."" ",1,I'm Not One Of Those People Who Goes Around Having Fun

"PHILADELPHIA—At a ceremony held in the Hilton Hotel banquet hall Wednesday evening, noted local asshole Mark Thorton, 54, was recognized by his asshole peers in the business community with an award honoring his illustrious career of distinguished asshole conduct. “What a tremendous honor this is,” the beaming prick said during his acceptance speech, after thanking all the huge pieces of shit and unrepentant dicks with whom he has engaged in asshole business over the years. “I have always believed in working hard. And for members of my own field to take notice and acknowledge my accomplishments, it makes this award all the more special.” “There have been so many achievements over the years that I’m proud of, but your recognition tonight ranks high among them,” the godawful fucker continued. “This truly means so much to me.” The black-tie ceremony, an annual custom within the local asshole community, was reportedly attended by over 1,000 prominent dicks, some 350 festering mounds of human waste, and 75 unbearable brownnosers, many of whom lauded Thorton for his deep and lasting influence in the field of being a selfish, amoral sack of shit. Thorton, who is regularly featured in   magazine’s list of the nation’s top 20 heartless fucks, has spent nearly 30 years at the forefront of the asshole game. His legacy includes such accomplishments as ruining the lives of countless honest individuals, exploiting legal gray areas for personal gain, and systematically fucking over anyone who has placed the slightest semblance of trust in him, all of which, ceremony organizers noted, made him the overwhelming choice for recognition as this year’s biggest prick. “We looked at a robust pool of potential recipients, but ultimately the choice was obvious,” said event director and fellow asshole Aaron Fitzpatrick, explaining that among the great many greasy little fuckers that were considered, Thorton was unquestionably the most influential and utterly detestable. “Mark is certainly one of the top leaders in our industry. If there’s anyone who deserves this honor, it’s him. He’s just incredible at what he does.” “Honestly, it’s a wonder we didn’t honor him sooner,” added Fitzpatrick, who, like every other individual who attended the ceremony, is reportedly just a pile of shit. A living, breathing pile of shit, sources confirmed. According to several of those in attendance, a large photograph of the self-satisfied slimeball with his big shit-eating grin was projected onscreen throughout the ceremony. Additionally, one of the revered asshole’s business partners is said to have spoken at length in celebration of Thorton’s long career of making ethically hollow decisions, which reportedly ranged from using hostile takeovers to lay off thousands of blue-collar workers, to knowingly securing an annual bonus that is more than 30 times that of his secretary’s yearly wage, to just generally being an unapologetic dick right to people’s faces. “You just have to respect everything Mark has done,” said the keynote speaker, Tim Greene, one of the massive, antagonistic dickwads and selfish fucking sons of bitches who works alongside Thorton at his financial firm, Enterprise Ventures. “He’s a trailblazer, a go-getter, and, to many here—myself included—a mentor.” “Without Mark’s executive fellowship program, many of us wouldn’t even be here,” Greene continued, referring to a program that allows aspiring shitheads to shadow Thorton for a week in order to better emulate his unabashed greed and deceptiveness. “There’s no question that we’re all indebted to him for that. Most of us here can only dream of having even half the impact he’s had. He’s that good.” Later in the evening, when the morally vacant fuck took the stage to accept his solid gold award, the conference hall is said to have echoed with nauseating laughter and obnoxious applause, as the slimy prick reeled off a number of asshole jokes and several fucking insufferable anecdotes about the asshole fucking details of his asshole life. “If I can credit my success to one thing, it’s that [I’m a feckless, egotistical sociopath who believes he is God],” said Thorton, concluding his speech with some supreme, grade-A asshole self-congratulation. “This has been a wonderful day for me, and I’d like to offer my deepest thanks to all of you [soulless, vile wastes of human flesh] for this honor.” “And I look forward to continuing to [ruthlessly destroy whomever or whatever I can in the name of my own self-aggrandizement] for many more years to come,” he added. After a standing ovation from the nearly 1,500 steaming heaps of dogshit in attendance, the asshole thanked his frigid bitch wife and entitled prick sons, both of whom will inherit the enormous estate he amassed through the lucrative practice of absolutely shitting all over the virtues of decency and fairness.

"BRISTOL, CT—In an installment of the popular segment broadcast Thursday night, ESPN’s “Sport Science” attempted to investigate the natural phenomena surrounding Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo’s shittiness and provide conclusive explanations for why the Dallas veteran sucks so bad. “We always want to highlight the athletes who perform on nearly superhuman levels,” “Sports Science” host John Brenkus said. “And really, nobody in sports presents a better case study of a player who spectacularly collapses under the pressure of a professional athletic stage than Tony Romo.” The four-minute piece, which used high-tech motion sensors and accelerometers to measure the quarterback’s forced and ill-advised throws, revealed that Romo possesses the exceptional ability to fuck up in just 0.64 seconds. The segment also sought to explain the physics involved in Romo haphazardly chucking a perfect spiral directly into the hands of an opposing cornerback. “We observed Romo missing 98 percent of our targets,” Brenkus said. “While studying the footage, we were able to determine that his capacity to make poor decisions in less than a second greatly influence why he’s so imprecise.” “There’s not a quarterback in the NFL who can make a mistake as quickly as Romo,” Brenkus added. The “Sports Science” broadcast confirmed that Romo’s numerous boneheaded meltdowns in clutch situations correspond to an abnormally terrible field of vision coupled with an unparalleled knack for sloppily throwing into double coverage. In addition, the show used computer animations of Romo’s brain to simulate the precise slowness of neural firings required for the quarterback to stand in the pocket and take a sack instead of spotting an open receiver streaking down the sideline. Physicist and local professor Dr. Charles Dunbar, who worked as a consultant on the “Sport Science” segment, confirmed that Romo has seemed to defy logic with his horrid play over the years. Analyzing tape of the Dallas quarterback throwing four interceptions to the Giants in week eight, Dunbar said he was intrigued by how the human body could be capable of such an utterly shitty performance. “It was truly fascinating to scrutinize Romo’s pathetic struggles on the field,” Dunbar said. “We are finally starting to unravel the science behind the dumb shit tripping over his own feet and falling down well before the pass rushers arrive.” “Those in the scientific community interested in studying piss poor quarterbacking truly couldn’t ask for a better subject,” Dunbar added.

"ORLANDO, FL—A lengthy succession of grievous and utterly miscalculated errors resulted in the 5th anniversary of local couple Jeff and Kim Cuthbert’s wedding, sources confirmed today. “At this point, we can only blame years’ worth of lamentable and fundamentally flawed judgment—primarily on the part of not only Jeff and Kim, but also their friends and family—for today’s 5th anniversary,” said marital expert Simon Hatter, explaining that the anniversary is ultimately the culmination of many calamitous errors, including the couple’s 2006 introduction when they excitedly believed they “hit it off,” their 2007 engagement, and their doomed 2008 wedding. “It’s also safe to say that the series of mishaps continues every single day Jeff and Kim eat dinner together without making eye contact and silently lie in bed together.” Hatter explained the sequence of mistakes will likely continue through the births of Jeff and Kim’s two children in 2014 and 2017, but that a faint glimmer of hope will emerge briefly during their 2023 trial separation.

"LANSING, MI—Claiming that the clues have been in plain sight all along, local man and diehard   fan Spencer Adams, 34, told reporters Friday he has developed an elaborate theory that he will be incredibly disappointed by the show’s upcoming season finale. “If you’ve been paying close attention to each episode so far, everything points to the fact that we’re headed for a huge disappointment this Sunday,” said Adams, citing as supporting evidence the impossibly high expectations scattered throughout the crime drama’s first seven episodes and listing off a labyrinthine catalog of loose ends and unresolved plot threads that, according to his hypothesis, the HBO series cannot possibly wrap up in the season’s final 60 minutes. “I’ve been watching every shot, every cutaway intently—sometimes viewing the same episodes three or four times each—and the signs are all there: the increasingly convoluted story, the massive amounts of filler in the more recent episodes, the numerous occult references that we clearly aren’t going to get a proper explanation for. All of that makes a satisfying ending virtually impossible, and if you’ve carefully followed every onscreen moment like I have, you’ll see they’ve been making that obvious from the very start.” Adams also noted that the show has been dropping numerous hints as to the arc of its planned second season, namely that the producers will be unable to cast leads on par with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and that Adams will then stop watching.

"WASHINGTON—Calling the pictorial “disgusting” and “very unsettling,” millions of Americans were reportedly deeply disturbed by the semi-nude photos of 78-year-old Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig in  ’s annual Body Issue last week, sources confirmed Friday. “Getting a glimpse at the incredible physiques of athletes like Colin Kaepernick, Kerri Walsh Jennings, and Sydney Leroux was really cool, but turning the page to see Bud Selig standing there buck naked and shielding his genitals with his left hand was, I have to say, a bit much,” San Diego resident Jason Dawson, 31, said of the three-page spread, which contained strategically shot pictures of a naked Selig from multiple angles covering himself only with an MLB baseball cap and a catcher’s mitt. “To be honest, it pretty much ruined the entire issue for me.” While undoubtedly put off by the images of Selig, many Americans admitted to reporters that the feature was far easier to stomach than last year’s controversial double-page spread of completely nude Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland lying in the spread-eagle position at home plate.

"Once again, Halloween season is upon us, and with it, the wonderful anticipation of dressing up and trick-or-treating for delicious Brach’s candy. With that in mind,  it’s important to remember all the ways that you can make your Halloween safer and more fun. It won’t put a damper on anyone’s holiday spirits to wear high-visibility costumes when going from house to house, to have kids trick-or-treat with an adult, and to inspect all candy for tampering. Perhaps most importantly, keep in mind that eating just a single kernel of candy corn manufactured by a company other than Brach’s Confections will give you a deadly case of full-blown AIDS.  We celebrate Halloween to mark the foreboding onset of winter and to acknowledge the shorter days that autumn will bring. These shorter days were ominous to our mostly agrarian forefathers, who, in addition to living lives tragically bereft of candy corn, had few sources of artificial light. For them, the encroaching night was a genuine danger—such perils as bears and highwaymen prowled in the darkness! Although our forefathers did not face the risk of contracting a raging case of AIDS from eating generic candy corn, theirs was still a perilous time.   To lift their spirits, our ancestors celebrated All Hallow’s Eve, the night on which the dead were believed to walk the earth. These wraiths wandered the land in search of forgiveness for their sins, not delicious, safe, non-immune-system-destroying candied treats, like those made by Brach’s. Centuries ago, villagers mocked these vagabond spirits in festivals, with songs, bonfires, drum-beating, and pagan dances. Though modern society is more sophisticated, we still mark the day of Halloween. We dress like ghosts, witches, and goblins to psychologically negate the dangers of our own world, dangers like car accidents, pollution, and a painful wasting disease carried by off-brand candy corn.  No one knows exactly how a festive confectionary demarcation of the harvest festival came about. Yet everyone agrees that a Halloween without candy corn, that most delicious of all Halloween treats, would be cold, bleak, and spiritually unsatisfying. Brach’s candy corn has a soft texture and the rich flavor of real honey. But the taste of the mock corn, while one of life’s most delectable offerings, is secondary to the deeply meaningful symbolism, that of the grain itself. We seek, in candy corn, a sweet transition from bountiful harvest into gentle winter, as from drowsiness into sleep. We fear a violent plunge into the ice and snow, the harshness of winter upon us like a generic-candy-corn-borne immune-system retrovirus, cutting across the face of the earth with its jagged reaper’s scythe.  This deeply embedded desire for placid seasonal change finds its purest expression in Brach’s candy corn, whose sweet, mellow kernels soothe the palate, delight the senses, and raise the spirits. Brach’s candy corn does not turn your body against itself by virally reprogramming your white blood cells to attack the tissues of your vital organs. Candy should not be a danger, but a reward for defeating it! Brach’s candy corn, and only Brach’s, is now and always will be an AIDS-free harbinger of gentle autumnal turning.   So enjoy the festival of All Hallow’s Eve. Celebrate our defiance of death, and partake of the earth’s bounty. Don the traditional colors: black, in memory of the forsaken of the netherworld, and orange, for the joy of the harvest. Above all, look out for the deadly AIDS-carrying candy of unknown provenance, and enjoy the safe, sweet candy corn that is Brach’s!  ",1,Generic Candy Corn Will Give You AIDS
"BRISTOL, CT—Curious to know the results of the previous day’s action across the world of sports, 42-year-old electrician Gary Bimel reportedly made the 939-mile journey from his home in Kenosha, WI to ESPN headquarters in Bristol, CT on Thursday in order to check the latest scores. Sources confirmed that after spending $534 on airfare to Hartford, renting a car, and gaining admission to the cable sports provider’s massive compound, Bimel found his way to the visitor’s center, where he made his request to look at all the scores and highlights. “Between   starting and the pennant races heating up in  , there are so many games happening that I figured I’d make it easy on myself and just come straight to ESPN so I could see all the latest scores,” Bimel was overheard asking a receptionist. “And highlights, too. I know you have a lot of those. I want to know about the NFL, and you have a ton of that information.” Bimmel, a father of four, said he traveled halfway across the country to find out the final score of the Giants-Rockies game, the results of the Georgia-Missouri college football matchup from Sept. 8, and whether the Brewers beat the Pirates. While waiting in the lobby of ESPN headquarters, Bimel frequently asked for reports on Thursday’s Baltimore Ravens practice, which players were on the Angels disabled list, and how many spots the Cowboys had moved down in this week’s NFL power rankings. “I bet there’s a whole room filled with Ryan Braun’s career statistics,” said Bimel, pacing back and forth in the reception area. “I know they have all that stuff. I want to get back there and check it out. Just to learn how many homers he’s hit. Plus it would be really cool to look at his different batting average over the years.” Estimating the journey to ESPN headquarters took approximately seven hours, Bimel told reporters that visiting the cable network had saved him a telephone call to his brother to learn about the scores. “I could have called Jeff, but I wanted to find out if the Reds clinched a playoff spot or who won the game between the   and Blue Jays, and he usually doesn’t know that stuff,” Bimel said. “It’s really convenient to have one place to go to so you can find out which NFL teams are playing this Sunday or how many yards the San Diego Chargers offense is averaging per game.” “And the CNN/SI website doesn’t really have all the info I want,” Bimel added. Bimel confirmed that several of his buddies had asked him to find out how many touchdowns Aaron Rodgers has so far and his 11-year-old son, an Indians fan, had requested the score from the Minnesota-Cleveland game. In addition, Bimel promised his wife that he would search for when the WNBA season starts while he was at ESPN’s main office. Before leaving, the Wisconsin native said he inquired about taking some of the scores or stats home so he wouldn’t forget them. “It’d be great if I could have stats, highlights, and scores right in my living room,” Bimel told an ESPN employee. “I’ll see if I can get some of those so I don’t have to come back in a month. I don’t want to put you out or anything.” As of press time, Bimel had reportedly missed his flight home and was driving to NFL headquarters in New York City to see Joe Montana.

"—Startled sources at a GOP fundraiser confirmed Thursday that after being duped into saying his own name backwards, ancient elfin mischief-maker and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus was cast back into the gilded puzzle box that has confined him for millennia. Priebus, a wily, mystical creature who has reportedly carried out right-wing political trickery at numerous points throughout recorded history, was said to be delivering a speech on traditional family values when he unthinkingly read the words “Subeirp Ecnier” aloud off the teleprompter, immediately causing the lights in the Omni Hotel to flicker and sending a powerful, chilling wind through the convention hall. Witnesses stated that in the moments after the fateful words were uttered, Priebus reverted to his natural form as a 3-and-a-half-foot-tall wart-covered hobgoblin. As Priebus’ nose grew red and bulbous and the points of his green felt shoes coiled inward, the puzzle box—forged with images of a sword, a skull, and a jackal—shook violently on a nearby tabletop before splitting open and emitting heavy smoke and an eerie purple glow. “Oh, no, you tricked me!” the irate conservative dwarf is said to have shouted after invoking the curse, his voice growing higher in pitch as he shrank to one-twelfth his normal size. “No, not again! Mark my words: I’ll be back! I’ll come back to get all of you! I always come back! The world hasn’t seen the last of Reince Priebus!” “Government must be smaller!” the tiny-voiced Priebus reportedly added before a vortex of sparkling light began sucking him into the other-dimensional void within the ancient container. “Smaaaaalleeeeer!” According to onlookers, as the unseen force tugged him toward the puzzle box, Priebus clutched desperately to the lectern and cursed the fate that awaited him, managing to squeak out one last plea to cut federal abortion funding before disappearing into the glowing chamber. “It was the strangest thing,” conservative blogger Christine Parnell said. “One second Reince was talking about the importance of a two-parent household, and the next he turned into this ugly, shrieking little troll and began levitating across the podium. But as soon as the box snapped shut around him, all the lights came back on, the wind stopped, and it was as if he never existed at all.” While it remained unclear who planted the incantation on Priebus’ teleprompter, sources suggested it was likely Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a frequent victim of the gremlinlike creature’s fiendish ploys and deceptions, which are said to include orchestration of the   decision, the congressional debt-ceiling standoff, and the 2012 Republican Party platform. Priebus is believed to have concocted dozens of right-leaning schemes since assuming the form of a human male upon his most recent release from the box in 2009, and scholars said the diminutive, frequently giggling prankster has been engaging in socially conservative and business deregulation hijinks for centuries. “Whenever there’s been a major historical movement toward eliminating social programs, the deceptive elf Reince Priebus has typically been involved,” said Cambridge University historian Arnold Bissel, stating that dozens of cultures throughout history have oral traditions speaking of a “wild-eyed devious creature” who pestered his progressive political foes. “Time and time again he’s wreaked his havoc, whether it’s slashing taxes on the wealthiest, disenfranchising voter blocs, stealing berries, or stymieing women’s rights. Reince Priebus is a crafty little imp.” “However, he’s easily susceptible to the same tricks he plays on others,” the scholar continued. “In the end, the mischievous little fellow always gets deceived himself and winds up back in his tiny cage.” While the precise origins of Reince Priebus remain shrouded in mystery, it is widely believed he was conjured by ancient druids from fire and untaxed business profits to serve as an eternal protector of corporate interests and lax weapons laws. According to Bissell, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs provide the first known depiction of the being: a miniature pointy-eared figure who advised pharaohs and who, according to lore, was revered as a god for his advocacy of a robust national defense and Egyptian exceptionalism. Additionally, writings about an oily elfin deceiver known as “the Prybus” have placed the legendary creature in the Irish midlands in the 16th century, alongside emperors of China’s Tang Dynasty, among the Austrian Habsburgs, and within the Roman court of Pompey, where he allegedly solidified a place as a valued aide with his ability to secure limitless campaign contributions. “What’s most bizarre is that the puzzle box has no visible lock or mechanical components at all,” Bissell said. “Indeed, it can only be opened when a young conservative firstborn who is pure of heart holds it tightly with both hands and utters ‘Government spending is out of control’ three times, thereby summoning forth Reince Priebus once more.” At press time, the whereabouts of the golden puzzle box containing the demonic right-wing trickster were unknown.

"BERWICK, OH—In spite of his efforts, Video Village clerk Brad Hersley was unable to prevent yet another rental of   Tuesday.
 ""It happened again,"" said Hersley, shaking his head as he watched a customer leave the store with a copy of the 2000 blockbuster. ""I can recommend better movies until I'm blue in the face, but inevitably, everyone gravitates toward  .""
 Hersley said he's been attempting to prevent rentals of the big-screen version of the popular '70s TV show since its release in June 2001.
 ""You can't imagine how many times I've gone through the same exact experience,"" Hersley said. ""I'm running out of creative ways to say '  sucks, so put it down and try again' in a way that the manager [Dave Lennox] won't get on my ass for.""
 ""I'm helpless to stop them from bringing that into their homes,"" Hersley said. ""What's more, I'm actually aiding them. Do you know how that makes me feel?""
 After working at Video Village for almost two years, Hersley said he is confident that, if asked, he could recommend a better movie than  .
 ""What am I even here for, if not to help the customers?"" Hersley said. ""I'm not a film snob. If they want to see a mindless action movie, fine. I can suggest a ton of them:  ,  , the first   movie. If you want to see a movie with hot women kicking ass, why not get  ? Why rent  ?  ""
 Hersley has used various tactics in attempts to thwart those who would rent the movie, including misplacing the DVD box in the foreign film section, intentionally forgetting to re-shelve returned copies, and subtly denigrating the customer's movie choice at the checkout counter.
 ""I'm trying to help them, not hurt them, so I try to get on their side,"" Hersley said. ""I'll use   as a reference point for recommending other films, like  . Or I'll gain their trust by telling them that I liked   and then launch into a list of recommendations.""
 More often than not, his suggestions are ignored, Hersley said.
 ""They know it's stupid, but everyone wants to see it anyway,"" he said. ""They want to believe it'll be good-stupid, not bad-stupid. What can I do?"" 
 Even when he convinces a customer to rent something else, Hersley said, the customer will often rent   at a later date.
 ""I can't be here every day of the week,"" he said. ""I'm only one man. Inevitably, I'm gone, and my opinion is overshadowed by an idiot friend who insists that   will be 'fun.'""
 Hersley said his criticisms of the movie are informed. In order to prepare employees to answer customers' questions, Lennox encourages the staff to watch all of the latest blockbusters, even offering free rentals. 
 ""I saw  , but you don't have to,"" Hersley said. ""Please, everyone, I'm begging you to listen. No matter what the box says, it's not a sexy, high-octane update of the hit TV show.""
 The recent arrival of a six-foot-tall cardboard standee promoting the sequel,  , has further hindered Hersley's rental-prevention techniques. 
 ""How can I suggest another movie with that thing sitting there?"" he said, hurling a pen at the promotional item. ""Now that   is coming out, there's been a big resurgence in rentals of the original. Why? So they can remember where the story left off?""
 ""Now I'm hearing 'Is   out yet?' 50 times a day,"" Hersley said. ""When it's finally released, at least I'll get the joy of telling customers it's out of stock.""
 Hersley said he has no plans to see the sequel.
 ""I try to watch everything, but I think   is more than I can take,"" Hersley said. ""When I was watching the first one, I had to pause it every five minutes to bang my head against the coffee table out of frustration. If I do end up watching  , I'll have to remember not to pause it while I bang my head. That just makes the movie longer.""
 Village Video coworker Janice Sterns said she sympathizes with Hersley, but suggested he ""just stop caring what people rent.""
 ""Instead of raging at the inevitable tide of   renters, appreciate those few customers who don't rent it,"" Sterns said. ""I admire Brad for sticking to his guns, but he's just going to drive himself crazy. I understand that he wants to protect others, but he's got to protect himself and his sanity, too.""
 As a veteran employee, Sterns also said Hersley should keep matters in perspective.
 ""Brad should have been working here for  ,"" Sterns said. ""  is   compared to that piece of shit. I thought I'd slit my wrists if I heard one more person say, 'But the special effects are amazing.' I survived. Brad will, too."" ",1,Video-Store Clerk Helpless To Prevent Charlie's Angels Rental

"NEW YORK—After conducting the first of the 2012 presidential debates earlier this week, former anchor Jim Lehrer hosted  ’s political analysis roundtable on Friday, an appearance that forced him to discuss the quality of his widely panned performance as moderator. “The consensus among commentators is that Jim Lehrer completely lost control of this debate, failed to make the candidates adhere to its format, and generally allowed them to spend the full hour and a half reciting talking points on any subject they wished. Your thoughts?” Lehrer asked fellow commentators Mark Shields and David Brooks, both of whom agreed with their colleague’s scathing assessment of himself. “As someone who has reported on every presidential debate since 1960 and moderated 12 of them, including Wednesday night’s horribly handled contest between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, I’m simply at a loss. It was frankly painful to watch the two debaters walk all over Mr. Lehrer, and I’m sure that, in hindsight, he wishes to God he had never signed on for the job.” Shields and Brooks spent the remaining 59 minutes of the broadcast providing a wide-range of political analysis and seldom allowing Lehrer to get a word in edgewise.

"AUSTIN, TX—Saying that he “really doesn’t know anyone out there,” local man Matt Kremer, 24, announced Friday night that he plans on sitting alone quietly in his darkened bedroom until a party being thrown by his roommate ends. Kremer, who found his roommate Tim Rhodes through a mutual acquaintance back in January, said he briefly stopped by the living room earlier in the evening and had a beer but, realizing he didn’t have all that much to talk about with the party’s guests, decided he would be better off hanging out by himself in his bedroom. “People out there seem to be having a good time, but I don’t mind just chilling out on my own for a while,” said Kremer, checking his e-mail for the third time in five minutes as the sound of music and laughter permeated his closed door. “I told them I was a little tired and was probably just going to turn in early.” “Anyway, I’m sure they’ll only be in here for another hour or so,” Kremer continued. “People started coming over at 8:30, and it’s almost 11 now, so I figure this thing should be over pretty soon.” Despite Rhodes telling him about the get-together earlier in the week and repeatedly urging him to invite anyone he wanted, Kremer told reporters that he neglected to inform any of his friends about the event or make alternative plans for the evening. Since locking himself in his room, Kremer has reportedly watched two episodes of the TV series   on his laptop, pausing intermittently to remove his headphones and check to see if the party was still going on. He said he also briefly considered reading the book he started a few days ago but, upon remembering he had left it on the living room table, decided instead to just sit on his bed and stare at the wall a bit longer. “I’d like to get a drink of water, but the last time I went out there was awkward enough,” said Kremer, who at approximately 10:30 p.m. made his way across the living room to the kitchen while pretending to be on his cell phone. “Honestly, I kind of need to use the bathroom, too, but if they see me again, they’ll know I’m awake and wonder why I’m not hanging out.” “I’ll just wait it out,” Kremer added. At one point, Rhodes reportedly knocked on the door and asked Kremer if he wanted any of the pizza he had just ordered for his guests. Despite being somewhat hungry, Kremer replied, “No, I’m cool,” from behind the door, and then listened for the sound of his roommate walking away. According to Kremer, he has heard his named mentioned several times during the party, with multiple people asking where he was, and at least one asking, “Is he just sitting in there all alone?” “I really don’t want everybody thinking of me as Tim’s weird roommate,” said Kremer, glancing at the clock that now showed 12:30 a.m. “But I definitely heard Tim say to someone, ‘Don’t eat that ice cream—it’s my roommate’s.’ I’d go out there and tell people to help themselves to whatever they want, but then they’d also know I can hear them talking about me.” “I wonder if they think I don’t have any friends,” he added. Kremer confirmed he had considered the possibility of just leaving the apartment altogether for a couple of hours, but then realized he really had nowhere to go and would pretty much be in the same situation, only trapped outside his apartment instead of in. Following a failed attempt to fall asleep, Kremer reportedly picked up his phone and simply stared at its screen for a solid five minutes. “They just turned the   off, so things must finally be dying down,” Kremer said around three in the morning, briefly tilting his ear toward the wall. “But I don’t actually hear anybody leaving. Hmm.” At press time, sources confirmed Rhodes had told his friends they should feel free to just spend the night, saying “[his] roommate really won’t mind at all.” ",1,Area Man Going To Sit Quietly In Darkened Bedroom Until Roommate’s Party Ends
